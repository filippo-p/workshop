A Republican strategy to counter the re-@@ election of Obama
Republican leaders j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied their policy by the need to com@@ b@@ at el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al fraud .
However , the B@@ r@@ en@@ n@@ an C@@ ent@@ re con@@ si@@ der@@ s this a m@@ y@@ th , stating that el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al fraud is r@@ ar@@ er in the United States than the number of people killed by li@@ gh@@ t@@ n@@ ing .
In@@ de@@ ed , Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al fraud in the United States in a de@@ c@@ a@@ de .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on vo@@ ter tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c system .
Un@@ like in Canada , the American States are responsible for the or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new la@@ ws since 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 making the re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation or voting process more difficult .
This ph@@ en@@ o@@ m@@ en@@ on gained m@@ o@@ m@@ ent@@ um following the November 20@@ 10 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Republican re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ at@@ i@@ ves added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 b@@ ill@@ s re@@ stri@@ c@@ ting the exercise of the right to vote in 4@@ 1 States were introduced in 20@@ 11 alone .
The new election la@@ ws re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e voters to show a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card and p@@ ro@@ of of US c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ ship .
Furthermore , these la@@ ws also reduce early voting periods , in@@ v@@ al@@ i@@ date the right to re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er as a vo@@ ter on election day and wi@@ th@@ draw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
Be@@ f@@ or@@ e the 2006 elections , no US State re@@ qu@@ i@@ red voters to show a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card .
In@@ di@@ ana was the first State to im@@ po@@ se such a re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment .
In 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ality of the In@@ di@@ ana law .
The Republican authorities were quick to e@@ x@@ tend this practice to other States .
Over the past two years , they sp@@ on@@ so@@ red b@@ ill@@ s in 3@@ 4 States to force voters to show a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card .
It is important to note that , un@@ like Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c , American citizens do not have a universal I@@ D card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i@@ .@@ e@@ . 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card issued by a government agency of their State .
In addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such i@@ den@@ ti@@ fication .
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to ob@@ ta@@ in the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red id@@ ent@@ ity card .
The new restrictions disp@@ ro@@ p@@ or@@ ti@@ on@@ ately affect young people , m@@ in@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ es and people with low in@@ comes .
In fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those e@@ ar@@ n@@ ing less than $ 3@@ 5,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 2@@ 9 years old do not have the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card .
And that 's not all .
St@@ ud@@ ent@@ s , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card issued by their in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on .
On the other hand , these same States al@@ low fishing or hun@@ ting club members , who vote more Republican , to use the cards issued by these c@@ lu@@ bs when they vote .
Prior to 2004 , no State re@@ qu@@ i@@ red p@@ ro@@ of of c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ ship to vote .
Arizona was the first to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce such a re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment .
Since 20@@ 11 , a dozen States have adopted la@@ ws re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing voters to prove they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the H@@ i@@ s@@ p@@ an@@ ic vote .
However , it appears that two out of three H@@ i@@ s@@ p@@ an@@ ic voters favour the Democratic party .
What is more , in 20@@ 11 Republican le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ lat@@ ors sp@@ on@@ so@@ red la@@ ws ab@@ ol@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing the re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation of voters on election day in eight States .
In addition , they limited the right of in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als and groups to provide assistance to voters w@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing to re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er .
These restrictions are not without con@@ sequ@@ ence .
For example , during the 2004 general election , vo@@ ter re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation camp@@ a@@ ig@@ n@@ s contributed to re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er@@ ing around 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 have led to a 17 % drop in the re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation rate of new voters in 20@@ 10 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Republican le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ lat@@ ors have en@@ acted la@@ ws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
For example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were A@@ f@@ ri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans , who ac@@ co@@ un@@ ted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
The same app@@ li@@ ed to Hispanics .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who vo@@ ted early .
On the other hand , 7@@ 6 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
Of course , Democratic le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ lat@@ ors and their supporters v@@ ig@@ or@@ ously opposed the ad@@ option of la@@ ws re@@ stri@@ c@@ ting vo@@ ter re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation .
Several b@@ ill@@ s were blocked by v@@ e@@ t@@ o@@ es of Democratic governors .
The United States A@@ tt@@ or@@ ne@@ y General inter@@ ven@@ ed to s@@ us@@ p@@ end the most controversial la@@ ws .
They were able to parti@@ ally limit the damage .
For example , only 16 out of 3@@ 4 States have adopted la@@ ws re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing the presentation of a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card .
However , the new r@@ ul@@ es put in place will undoub@@ te@@ d@@ ly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
Democratic c@@ r@@ it@@ ics den@@ oun@@ ce the par@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ an char@@ ac@@ ter of the la@@ ws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of in@@ f@@ lu@@ en@@ c@@ ing the 2012 results in key States .
A 20@@ 11 B@@ r@@ en@@ n@@ an C@@ ent@@ re report shows that the States that have adopted these la@@ ws re@@ present 17@@ 1 of the 270 votes needed in the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al college to win the Pre@@ si@@ den@@ cy .
It is too early to say with c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty that these le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ l@@ ative changes in the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al system will have significant im@@ p@@ acts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c system .
Pro@@ state cancer sc@@ re@@ en@@ ing : take the test or not ?
In@@ de@@ ed , the P@@ S@@ A test sometimes shows err@@ on@@ e@@ ou@@ s results with f@@ al@@ se negative or even f@@ al@@ se po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e results , which involve un@@ necessary medical inter@@ ven@@ tions .
En@@ ou@@ gh to make already re@@ lu@@ c@@ t@@ ant men h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to take sc@@ re@@ en@@ ing tests .
Take the test or not ?
We asked two spec@@ i@@ alists for their opinion .
In st@@ u@@ dies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ation between control groups , so it is difficult to inter@@ pre@@ t the data and make firm re@@ com@@ men@@ d@@ ations .
Another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence in m@@ or@@ t@@ ality between patients who were sc@@ re@@ en@@ ed and those who were not .
This study also showed , with a fol@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for m@@ e@@ t@@ ast@@ as@@ es to o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r in the absence of sc@@ re@@ en@@ ing .
I therefore re@@ commend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct rel@@ ative who previously had p@@ ro@@ state cancer .
A@@ f@@ ri@@ can@@ -@@ American men are also more at risk .
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been de@@ te@@ c@@ ted .
There are aggressive c@@ anc@@ ers and others that are in@@ d@@ ol@@ ent .
The p@@ at@@ i@@ ent really ne@@ e@@ ds to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by off@@ er@@ ing him the op@@ tions available , not necessarily tre@@ ating p@@ ro@@ state c@@ anc@@ ers that are not long-term life threatening , and op@@ ting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
Today , many men in whom cancer has been de@@ te@@ c@@ ted will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
A@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ e monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease p@@ ro@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ es , they will be offered treatment .
More and more , specific c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ia are being de@@ ter@@ m@@ in@@ ed in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ f@@ or@@ e I re@@ commend taking the test .
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
In c@@ ol@@ l@@ abor@@ ation with the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ é@@ t@@ é inter@@ nation@@ al@@ e d '@@ u@@ ro@@ lo@@ g@@ ie [ SI@@ U ] , Mo@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er has created a t@@ oo@@ l that makes it possible to e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate the p@@ ro@@ s and con@@ s of the P@@ S@@ A test .
You can down@@ lo@@ ad the document ( in English for the time being , a [ French ] trans@@ l@@ ation will be available shortly ) at this address : http : / / c@@ a@@ .@@ mo@@ v@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ .com / f@@ r / men@@ s-@@ health / p@@ ro@@ st@@ at@@ e-@@ c@@ anc@@ er-@@ sc@@ re@@ en@@ ing
Pre@@ vent@@ ing the disease
Un@@ f@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ ately , there is no m@@ ir@@ ac@@ le re@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ e for pre@@ vent@@ ing cancer .
Despite the progress in research , the ad@@ option of h@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing from it .
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough , 30 % of c@@ anc@@ ers could be pre@@ vent@@ ed .
" If no more people s@@ mo@@ ked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , " says An@@ d@@ r@@ é Beau@@ li@@ e@@ u , spokesman for the Canadian C@@ anc@@ er S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ty .
On the other hand , it is estimated that rou@@ gh@@ ly 10 % of c@@ anc@@ ers are her@@ edit@@ ar@@ y .
Some are also com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely un@@ e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed .
For the Canadian C@@ anc@@ er S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ty , the fight against to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o remains a priority , despite the de@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ e in the number of s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers .
C@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es are linked to 85 % of l@@ un@@ g cancer cases .
It is also a risk factor for a number of others .
This massi@@ v@@ ely damages people 's health .
" Even today , there are 1.5 million s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers in Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c " de@@ plo@@ res sp@@ o@@ k@@ es@@ person An@@ d@@ r@@ é Beau@@ li@@ e@@ u .
En@@ cour@@ ag@@ ing data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of d@@ y@@ ing from cancer drops by half .
W@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t
O@@ v@@ er@@ weight and obesity are also con@@ du@@ c@@ i@@ v@@ e to the on@@ set of the disease , according to the S@@ C@@ C .
They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , col@@ on and rec@@ t@@ um , o@@ es@@ op@@ h@@ ag@@ us , p@@ an@@ c@@ re@@ as and u@@ ter@@ us .
" Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life p@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ ts against col@@ on cancer " it is also said .
D@@ i@@ e@@ t
The or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation also re@@ com@@ men@@ ds li@@ mit@@ ing your consumption of red meat .
In large amounts , it increases the risks of developing col@@ o-@@ rec@@ t@@ al cancer .
L@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ w@@ ise , so do c@@ ured meat products , and these should be avo@@ i@@ ded .
The conserv@@ ation of meat by smoking , d@@ r@@ y@@ ing or cur@@ ing can cause the f@@ or@@ m@@ ation of car@@ c@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ s .
" They can damage c@@ ells in the body and lead to the development of cancer " it is e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed .
V@@ it@@ am@@ ins
In recent years , a number of s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ st@@ s have studied the links between vit@@ am@@ in su@@ p@@ p@@ le@@ ments and cancer .
For the time being however their research is in@@ conc@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ e .
St@@ u@@ dies on vit@@ am@@ in E are con@@ tra@@ di@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ y , according to the S@@ C@@ C .
While one study noted a de@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ e in the risk of p@@ ro@@ state cancer , another noted an increase .
Also the effect of vit@@ am@@ in D on cancer is not clear .
In addition , Mr Beau@@ li@@ e@@ u emph@@ as@@ i@@ s@@ es the importance of di@@ sc@@ us@@ s@@ ing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
" T@@ aking a sc@@ re@@ en@@ ing test doesn 't give you cancer . "
The H@@ ig@@ g@@ s bo@@ son revealed
The announcement of the p@@ ro@@ b@@ able discovery of the H@@ ig@@ g@@ s bo@@ son created quite a stir last su@@ m@@ m@@ er , and with good reason .
In@@ de@@ ed , it is believed that this bo@@ son is part of the m@@ e@@ ch@@ an@@ ism responsible for the m@@ ass of everything in the Un@@ i@@ verse , no less .
Also it is the last partic@@ le whose e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence is predicted by the Standard Mo@@ de@@ l - our best or " less wor@@ se " explanation of the nature and be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our of matter - but which has not yet been observed em@@ p@@ i@@ ri@@ c@@ ally .
But for physi@@ c@@ ists , it is still not com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely sure that it really is the H@@ ig@@ g@@ s .
We know without a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w of a doubt that it is a new a@@ u@@ th@@ en@@ ti@@ c partic@@ le , and g@@ re@@ at@@ ly re@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ es the H@@ ig@@ g@@ s bo@@ son predicted by the Standard Mo@@ de@@ l .
In addition , new data un@@ ve@@ il@@ ed this week at a large physi@@ c@@ s Congress in K@@ yo@@ to seem to con@@ firm this , but there are still in@@ su@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ent data to be per@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ ly sure .
But let 's su@@ p@@ po@@ se that it really is the H@@ ig@@ g@@ s , since the ch@@ an@@ ces of being m@@ i@@ st@@ ak@@ en seem sli@@ m , and see what it is .
In our world , there is a fatally un@@ avo@@ id@@ able law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time .
There 's no way to break this rule - and don 't try too hard , you 'll go m@@ a@@ d .
However , even though partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ s is a very st@@ range world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Pau@@ l@@ i e@@ x@@ c@@ lu@@ si@@ on p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le , which states that two partic@@ l@@ es cannot occup@@ y the same sp@@ ace at the same time if they are in the same " quant@@ um state " - this " state " consisting rou@@ gh@@ ly of certain of their char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ st@@ ics .
Based on this , physi@@ c@@ ists c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fy partic@@ l@@ es into two cat@@ eg@@ or@@ ies .
In one cor@@ ner we have good citizens called fer@@ m@@ i@@ on@@ s , who w@@ i@@ s@@ ely o@@ be@@ y the Pau@@ l@@ i p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le .
While lur@@ king in the other are the bo@@ s@@ on@@ s , a n@@ ast@@ y b@@ and of an@@ ar@@ ch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le , which m@@ e@@ ans that they can in@@ de@@ ed be found in the same place at the same time .
These bo@@ s@@ on@@ s are then di@@ vi@@ ded into two groups , according to the B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey L@@ ab@@ s P@@ ar@@ tic@@ le Ad@@ venture site ( absolutely e@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ y , by the way ) : mes@@ on@@ s , which we will not discuss here , and " force partic@@ l@@ es " by which the great forces of nature are prop@@ ag@@ ated and to which the H@@ ig@@ g@@ s bo@@ son may be somehow related .
These bo@@ s@@ on@@ s , it must be stressed here , are not all such e@@ x@@ o@@ tic bugs as you might think .
In fact , if you can read this article , it is th@@ an@@ ks to an e@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ y b@@ an@@ al bo@@ son : the p@@ h@@ o@@ ton , or the " light partic@@ le " which is the " m@@ es@@ sen@@ ger " of the el@@ ec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic force .
When , in fact , a partic@@ le having an electric charge ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ at@@ es or changes direction , this " di@@ st@@ ur@@ bs " the el@@ ec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field in this specific place , rather like a p@@ e@@ b@@ ble thrown in a p@@ on@@ d .
This " di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ance " p@@ ro@@ du@@ c@@ es an el@@ ec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic wave ( of light , in@@ f@@ r@@ a@@ red , ultra@@ viol@@ et e@@ t@@ c . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a p@@ h@@ o@@ ton - and th@@ us one of the " force car@@ ri@@ er " bo@@ s@@ on@@ s .
More st@@ able field
The same app@@ li@@ es to the H@@ ig@@ g@@ s bo@@ son , with the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence that it is another field , the H@@ ig@@ g@@ s field , which must be " di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed " for the bo@@ son to appear .
Now , this H@@ ig@@ g@@ s field is much , much more st@@ able than the el@@ ec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field ; to e@@ x@@ c@@ it@@ e it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a f@@ ro@@ zen p@@ on@@ d which would need a very large ro@@ ck to w@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ le the surface .
Which is why a huge partic@@ le ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ator like the one at C@@ E@@ R@@ N - the Large H@@ ad@@ r@@ on Col@@ li@@ der is a ring with a 27@@ km c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
The an@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ y with the el@@ ec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field is again useful for e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing the rel@@ ation@@ ship between the H@@ ig@@ g@@ s and m@@ ass .
In fact not all partic@@ l@@ es , or all materials , inter@@ act with the el@@ ec@@ tro@@ mag@@ ne@@ tic field .
Some , such as mag@@ nets , do so , but others don 't - a piece of p@@ a@@ p@@ er , for example , will never st@@ ick to a fri@@ dge .
And li@@ ke@@ w@@ ise , not all partic@@ l@@ es inter@@ act with the H@@ ig@@ g@@ s field : those that do so have m@@ ass , while the others ( such as the p@@ h@@ o@@ ton ) do not .
Now , what is it that all this research " can bring " ? as@@ ks M@@ s P@@ lam@@ on@@ don .
For science , it serves to ch@@ ec@@ k the v@@ al@@ i@@ d@@ ity of the Standard Mo@@ de@@ l ( SM ) , and also allows physicians to e@@ x@@ am@@ ine any di@@ sc@@ re@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ es between the ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ations and pre@@ di@@ c@@ tions of the SM .
A number of people , mo@@ re@@ over , fer@@ v@@ ent@@ ly hope that some will be found , because the sli@@ gh@@ test di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence could open a do@@ or to a " new physi@@ c@@ s " and pl@@ u@@ g certain holes in the Mo@@ de@@ l .
This , it must be said , still has huge short@@ com@@ ings , off@@ er@@ ing no explanation for g@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ ity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dark matter , which f@@ or@@ m@@ s approximately 80 % of the matter in the Un@@ i@@ verse ( re-@@ o@@ ops ! ) .
But to date no such di@@ sc@@ re@@ p@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ es have been found at C@@ E@@ R@@ N .
Re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ on@@ s
The re@@ per@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ on@@ s of this research on the daily life of the man in the stre@@ et are more difficult to pre@@ di@@ c@@ t , but it would be w@@ r@@ ong to assume that there won 't be any .
R@@ em@@ em@@ b@@ er : in the very early 60s , the p@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ ers of the l@@ as@@ er at Bell L@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies did not suspect the re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on that would be tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ed by their work .
They had an in@@ kling of the s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c applications , but nothing as to the rest .
In fact , the late W@@ ill@@ ar@@ d Bo@@ y@@ le - a physi@@ c@@ ist who worked at Bell L@@ ab@@ s , where the l@@ as@@ er was in@@ v@@ ent@@ ed in 1@@ 9@@ 60 , and who himself developed the first con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ou@@ s l@@ as@@ er ( the first were p@@ ul@@ s@@ ed ) in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 2 - told us that initially the l@@ as@@ er was rather seen as a " la@@ b g@@ ad@@ get . "
Just im@@ ag@@ ine ...
And then , applications can also come from all the in@@ st@@ ru@@ m@@ ent@@ ation that s@@ ur@@ ro@@ un@@ ds research .
For example , the same W@@ ill@@ ar@@ d Bo@@ y@@ le developed a small light sen@@ s@@ or in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 9 , during his work in op@@ tic@@ s .
This sen@@ s@@ or , although this was not at all the original in@@ ten@@ ti@@ on , now serves as an " eye " to all di@@ g@@ it@@ al cameras worldwide , and earned him the N@@ o@@ be@@ l physi@@ c@@ s prize in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 .
This does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ H@@ C will necessarily trans@@ form our li@@ ves , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
Pal@@ li@@ ative care - The best way to die ... | L@@ e De@@ vo@@ ir
With its D@@ y@@ ing with Dign@@ ity Commission , Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c recently di@@ sc@@ us@@ s@@ ed the d@@ el@@ i@@ c@@ ate issue of the end of life .
The debate is due to re@@ su@@ me shortly as a bill is being pre@@ p@@ a@@ red .
However , in this v@@ it@@ al area , much remains to be done .
L@@ e De@@ vo@@ ir attempted to look more closely .
Just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Mon@@ t@@ é@@ r@@ é@@ g@@ ie a@@ p@@ art@@ ment .
The f@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ ing p@@ ro@@ state cancer had allowed him a two-year re@@ sp@@ it@@ e .
" They gave me five years to live , I 've made it to seven , " he says , with m@@ i@@ x@@ ed emo@@ tions , l@@ y@@ ing in his bed at the V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care home in Bel@@ o@@ e@@ i@@ l , where he arrived the previous day .
" But it 's still a sh@@ o@@ ck , you can never be pre@@ p@@ a@@ red for it " he adds .
The disease is doing its work : huge w@@ e@@ ak@@ n@@ ess which pre@@ v@@ ent@@ s him going to the to@@ il@@ et alone , and even e@@ ating alone .
Sitting in front of an app@@ e@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ ing lunch , he con@@ s@@ ent@@ s to being helped to e@@ at , re@@ signed .
Cour@@ age@@ ou@@ s , he even man@@ ag@@ es to smile , talks to the st@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ ers b@@ u@@ st@@ ling around him , bringing him his m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ation , off@@ er@@ ing him a b@@ ath .
The cour@@ age of ordin@@ ar@@ y death .
" What I want most is to be c@@ ured of my di@@ ar@@ r@@ h@@ o@@ e@@ a , it 's h@@ um@@ ili@@ ating " he con@@ fi@@ ded .
A few hours later , the team found a c@@ ure for this illness .
" During our li@@ ves , we le@@ ar@@ n that a man p@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ es standing up , " says Pierre B@@ ro@@ de@@ u@@ r , psych@@ ologist at the V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home .
Reg@@ re@@ s@@ sing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an un@@ acceptable h@@ um@@ ili@@ ation .
" It de@@ p@@ en@@ ds on the person 's ability " to accept the re@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ si@@ on , he says .
Because , in the opinion of a number of people working in p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care , great m@@ o@@ m@@ ent@@ s o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r at the very h@@ e@@ art of such re@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ si@@ on .
P@@ at@@ i@@ ent@@ s at the V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care home all su@@ f@@ f@@ er from cancer .
They have a m@@ a@@ xim@@ um life e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ tan@@ cy of three months .
At this stage , the team of doc@@ tors and nurses s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unding them no longer provides so@@ -@@ called " cur@@ ative " care .
For M@@ r@@ s A. , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die " con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s and su@@ f@@ f@@ o@@ c@@ ating . "
But the disease has made me di@@ s@@ cover my children .
" I have fine children " she adds .
" I don 't wish for anything more in life " she says , before ac@@ c@@ ep@@ ting having a m@@ ask put on to help her bre@@ a@@ the .
She looks forward ne@@ v@@ er@@ th@@ el@@ ess , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from I@@ tal@@ y .
At V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is , a group of v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers provides bo@@ di@@ ly care and help with feeding .
This is p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care , given when there is nothing else that can be done .
To make death more comfortable .
In Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c , there are p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care be@@ ds for 1@@ 1,@@ 7@@ 00 in@@ hab@@ it@@ an@@ ts .
This is very few when we know that we will all die one day .
Here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains D@@ r Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ian@@ e Mar@@ te@@ l , one of the doc@@ tors at the home .
W@@ h@@ e@@ th@@ er at a physical com@@ f@@ or@@ t , emo@@ tional or sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al level .
A person who is d@@ y@@ ing will accept being helped to drink b@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ y or Pepsi , whatever is their ti@@ p@@ p@@ le .
Di@@ a@@ be@@ tic@@ s no longer need to control their blood su@@ gar .
And death is part of everyday life .
Y@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ day evening , a be@@ er was served to Mr X , who died during the night .
This morning , it is his son who will finish the be@@ er at the feet of the de@@ c@@ eased .
" We help relatives as much as patients " says N@@ a@@ th@@ al@@ ie S@@ av@@ ar@@ d , Di@@ rec@@ tor of Care .
At the V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home , one day fol@@ lo@@ w@@ s another but no two are alike .
Along with a 93@@ -year-old man who is sa@@ vo@@ uring his last meeting with his family , sitting f@@ ir@@ m@@ ly w@@ e@@ d@@ ged in his p@@ il@@ lo@@ w@@ s while to@@ asts are drunk in his hon@@ our , a 36-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ young man is d@@ y@@ ing tr@@ ag@@ ically , s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
" For six months , there have always been three to five be@@ ds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old " says a conc@@ ern@@ ed D@@ r Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ian@@ e Mar@@ te@@ l .
5@@ 3 % of patients ad@@ mit@@ ted to the V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital .
L@@ ac@@ k of access to p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care
It is said that 77 % of C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ ans simply have no access to p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care , which is care designed to e@@ as@@ e the pain when a p@@ at@@ i@@ ent has re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed the ter@@ m@@ in@@ al stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home .
And a number of or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ations , such as the V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ -@@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is home and the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ty in G@@ re@@ ater Mon@@ tre@@ al , spec@@ i@@ al@@ ise more or less e@@ x@@ c@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ ely in care provided to cancer patients .
It is pre@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ ely this large gap in Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c health care which has made a number of p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care physicians fear the ad@@ option of a law on e@@ u@@ th@@ an@@ a@@ si@@ a and as@@ si@@ sted su@@ icide .
Since October , a manifest@@ o , signed by p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care l@@ um@@ in@@ ar@@ ies including D@@ r B@@ al@@ four Mo@@ unt and D@@ r B@@ er@@ n@@ ar@@ d La@@ po@@ in@@ te , has been c@@ ir@@ c@@ ul@@ ating to demonstrate their opposition to such an in@@ it@@ i@@ ative .
According to D@@ r Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ian@@ e Mar@@ te@@ l , the Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be ent@@ it@@ led to quality p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to e@@ u@@ th@@ an@@ a@@ si@@ a .
Rec@@ ent@@ ly , she says , I saw a p@@ at@@ i@@ ent spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to e@@ as@@ e her su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing .
I 'm af@@ r@@ a@@ id that patients ask to die because they don 't receive adequate care .
And at the same time , some on@@ c@@ ologists work rel@@ ent@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst p@@ ro@@ g@@ n@@ o@@ s@@ es .
H@@ é@@ l@@ è@@ n@@ e R@@ ich@@ ar@@ d 's s@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ al hopes were already m@@ in@@ im@@ al when she ended her g@@ ru@@ ell@@ ing ch@@ emo@@ therapy .
When I announced to my on@@ c@@ ologist that I was st@@ op@@ p@@ ing the treatment , she told me she re@@ g@@ re@@ t@@ ted that I had given up fighting , she said .
However , she had told me I was finished !
No all-@@ powerful care
D@@ r Mar@@ te@@ l believes that 90 % of patients asking to die th@@ an@@ k c@@ are@@ -@@ g@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s for not having ac@@ c@@ e@@ ded to their request after they have been re@@ li@@ e@@ v@@ ed of their pain by a p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care team .
But it must be said that p@@ al@@ li@@ ative care is not absolutely all-@@ powerful in the treatment of pain .
According to El@@ sie Mon@@ er@@ e@@ au , Pal@@ li@@ ative Care Di@@ rec@@ tor with the Pal@@ li@@ ative Care S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ty in G@@ re@@ ater Mon@@ tre@@ al , patients are re@@ si@@ st@@ ant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
At the very end of life , physicians then often re@@ s@@ or@@ t to p@@ al@@ li@@ ative se@@ d@@ ation , which is equivalent to putting the p@@ at@@ i@@ ent to sle@@ ep until the time of death , either sp@@ or@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ally or per@@ man@@ ent@@ ly .
We can no longer pre@@ tend not to understand this part of their su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing .
In@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ ingly , an un@@ re@@ li@@ e@@ v@@ ed p@@ at@@ i@@ ent will have the option of having such p@@ al@@ li@@ ative se@@ d@@ ation .
P@@ at@@ i@@ ent@@ s who are not re@@ li@@ e@@ v@@ ed always say the same thing : " I want to die . "
But this does not necessarily mean " I want you to e@@ u@@ th@@ an@@ ise me , " it m@@ e@@ ans " I want to be re@@ li@@ e@@ v@@ ed . "

Wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad real e@@ st@@ ate sc@@ an@@ d@@ als in Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c
Day after day high@@ way officials , building con@@ tr@@ actors , political party f@@ und@@ -@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ ers and Italian m@@ af@@ ia spec@@ i@@ alists tell what they know of a f@@ or@@ m@@ id@@ able " system , " com@@ b@@ in@@ ing the building industry , government officials , p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans , trade un@@ i@@ on@@ ists and or@@ g@@ an@@ ised crime .
An " industry " which has cost Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c taxpayers de@@ ar@@ ly , especially in the 1990s and 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ s .
" It is cur@@ ious how the system is cru@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ing since we took dra@@ st@@ ic measures " says Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au ir@@ on@@ ically , a Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c politician and former Mon@@ tre@@ al Chief of Police .
It was through him that the scandal broke in 20@@ 11 , in an in-@@ depth investigation into corruption related to road con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction con@@ tr@@ acts in Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c , to which the liber@@ al Prime Minister at the time , J@@ e@@ an Cha@@ rest , had con@@ s@@ ent@@ ed only re@@ lu@@ c@@ t@@ an@@ t@@ ly .
The " Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au report " established a direct link between industry , un@@ der@@ -@@ th@@ e-@@ table fin@@ anc@@ ing of parties and bri@@ bery of officials .
" Since the in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y opened in 20@@ 10 , he says , the Ministry of Tran@@ sport alone re@@ p@@ or@@ te@@ d@@ ly saved a billion dollars on con@@ tr@@ acts , " with certain people cur@@ b@@ ing their in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts to get a share !
The Ch@@ ar@@ b@@ on@@ ne@@ au Commission " has already brought down two m@@ ay@@ ors " he adds , hoping that it will su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed in " revealing the schemes behind the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als . "
A per@@ man@@ ent anti-@@ corruption unit , created in 20@@ 11
The Per@@ man@@ ent Anti@@ -@@ Cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ti@@ on Un@@ it , created in 20@@ 11 , is also c@@ ou@@ pled with its army of government an@@ al@@ y@@ st@@ s , in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ at@@ ors , and a@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ ors .
P@@ lu@@ s the " Mar@@ te@@ au s@@ qu@@ ad " po@@ li@@ c@@ em@@ en who , since 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 , have a@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly led the Mon@@ tre@@ al " se@@ w@@ er car@@ te@@ l " to so@@ f@@ t pe@@ d@@ al on the inflation of con@@ tr@@ acts ...
In recent weeks , it has conducted a series of sear@@ ches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans , such as Frank Z@@ am@@ p@@ in@@ o and R@@ ich@@ ar@@ d Mar@@ co@@ t@@ te , Mayor of a suburban town .
N@@ e@@ x@@ t on the list is a@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly G@@ ill@@ es V@@ a@@ ill@@ an@@ court , who has just re@@ signed from his post as Mayor of L@@ av@@ al , third largest city in Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c .
He is s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ ted of po@@ ck@@ e@@ t@@ ing re@@ pe@@ ated bri@@ b@@ es in exchange for public con@@ tr@@ acts .
Others formally accused are Mon@@ tre@@ al high@@ way eng@@ ine@@ ers and Italian ent@@ re@@ p@@ r@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ s , including Tony A@@ c@@ cur@@ so and Lin@@ o Z@@ am@@ bit@@ o .
The latter caused a sen@@ s@@ ation by e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ing the m@@ e@@ ch@@ an@@ ics of the public con@@ tr@@ acts " system " to the commission .
He himself paid 3 % of the value of the con@@ tr@@ acts ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed in Mon@@ tre@@ al to an inter@@ medi@@ ar@@ y linked to the m@@ af@@ ia who in turn paid the money to Union Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , Mayor G@@ é@@ r@@ al@@ d T@@ re@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ay 's party .
Mr Z@@ am@@ bit@@ o has h@@ an@@ d@@ ed money out fre@@ ely in the 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ s , giving over 88@@ ,000 Canadian dollars ( rou@@ gh@@ ly 68@@ ,000 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s ) to provincial parties , especially the Li@@ b@@ er@@ als then in power .
He also ad@@ mit@@ ted having or@@ g@@ an@@ ised an illegal f@@ und@@ r@@ a@@ iser for former Li@@ b@@ er@@ al De@@ p@@ ut@@ y-@@ Prime Minister , N@@ a@@ th@@ al@@ ie Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au .
S@@ e@@ w@@ er con@@ tr@@ acts with infl@@ ated costs
In Mon@@ tre@@ al , the corruption " system " ran s@@ m@@ oo@@ th@@ ly .
G@@ ill@@ es Sur@@ p@@ r@@ en@@ ant , former public works eng@@ ine@@ er , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction companies gifts , in@@ v@@ it@@ ations to trips , g@@ ol@@ f to@@ ur@@ n@@ am@@ ent@@ s , restaurants , h@@ o@@ ck@@ ey m@@ at@@ ches and bri@@ b@@ es to@@ t@@ all@@ ing 7@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 dollars , in exchange for se@@ w@@ er con@@ tr@@ acts of which he infl@@ ated the costs .
Other high@@ way officials ad@@ mit@@ ted having their p@@ al@@ ms g@@ re@@ ased by in@@ f@@ lat@@ ing in@@ vo@@ i@@ c@@ es by 30 to 40 % , and by f@@ al@@ se ad@@ d@@ -@@ on@@ s .
Th@@ en an or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ er of the Mayor 's party , Martin D@@ um@@ on@@ t , accused Mr T@@ re@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ay of having deliber@@ ately closed his eyes to a par@@ al@@ le@@ l b@@ u@@ d@@ get feeding his co@@ f@@ f@@ ers with dirty money .
Following these revelations , Mr T@@ re@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ay re@@ signed in early November , pl@@ ung@@ ing Mon@@ tre@@ al into a major crisis .
Ch@@ an@@ t@@ al Rou@@ le@@ au was one of the first women in Mon@@ tre@@ al to raise the al@@ arm .
Mayor of the bor@@ ou@@ gh of Ri@@ vi@@ è@@ re-@@ des@@ -@@ Pra@@ i@@ ries , to the East of the i@@ s@@ land , she p@@ ro@@ te@@ sted in 20@@ 10 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and re@@ sold for ... 1.6 million to developers , at the h@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t of the real e@@ st@@ ate b@@ oo@@ m .
70 % dirty money in election camp@@ a@@ ig@@ n@@ s
On the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she " is following a thread in order to find out how the system - in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ated by an@@ ts - works , to put a stop to the g@@ an@@ g@@ r@@ ene and cat@@ ch the c@@ ul@@ p@@ r@@ its . "
The process , she says , is " painful but po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e . "
The w@@ o@@ un@@ d is being c@@ le@@ an@@ ed , but Mon@@ tre@@ al would need its own in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ ative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avo@@ id the return of these questionable p@@ r@@ ac@@ ti@@ ces .
How to c@@ le@@ an h@@ ou@@ se .
Pro@@ per@@ ly .
Jacques Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au notes for his part that " officials st@@ ol@@ e hundreds of millions of dollars , " but he is especially conc@@ ern@@ ed about the role of " elected people aw@@ are of the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e , " when they were not up to their ne@@ cks in the sc@@ am !
E@@ st@@ im@@ ating the share of dirty money in the fin@@ anc@@ ing of election camp@@ a@@ ig@@ n@@ s in Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c at 70 % , he says d@@ r@@ y@@ ly : " I was told that it was only a p@@ al@@ e re@@ f@@ le@@ ction of reality . "
The Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c government p@@ ro@@ po@@ s@@ es to limit don@@ ations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : " Un@@ ti@@ l election expenses are strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . "
He advocates a complete over@@ hau@@ l of the system for g@@ r@@ an@@ ting public con@@ tr@@ acts and party f@@ un@@ ding : " We can 't go any lower ; getting to the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m of things , with cour@@ age , will help to re@@ build the h@@ ou@@ se on more so@@ li@@ d fo@@ und@@ ations , with more controls and la@@ ws . "
Although this story tar@@ n@@ ishes the international image of Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c and Mon@@ tre@@ al , Mr Du@@ ch@@ es@@ ne@@ au in@@ v@@ it@@ es anyone l@@ a@@ u@@ gh@@ ing to look in their own b@@ ack@@ y@@ ar@@ d ...
" P@@ S@@ G is not FC Barcelona ! "
This season , you have taken on a new st@@ at@@ ure with P@@ S@@ G .
How do you explain this p@@ ro@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ si@@ on ?
It can be e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed by in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al awareness but also by the new di@@ men@@ si@@ on of P@@ S@@ G .
Some great players have arrived .
Every day I 'm making progress al@@ on@@ g@@ side them .
The te@@ ch@@ n@@ ical staff has also brought me a lot .
Day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .
And , in a match , it 's e@@ a@@ si@@ er .
Everything moves very fast in football .
But I don 't get worked up .
From my debut at the C@@ la@@ i@@ re@@ f@@ on@@ ta@@ ine IN@@ F pre@@ -@@ training centre to my transfer to S@@ ain@@ t@@ -@@ E@@ ti@@ en@@ n@@ e , I 've always mo@@ v@@ ed step by step .
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Car@@ l@@ o An@@ c@@ el@@ o@@ tt@@ i ...
This su@@ m@@ m@@ er 's rec@@ ru@@ its are used to playing m@@ at@@ ches at a high level .
They also know that every training session is crucial .
Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best .
On the other hand , Car@@ l@@ o An@@ c@@ el@@ o@@ tt@@ i gives me a lot as re@@ g@@ ar@@ ds my position .
He 's su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted by de@@ pu@@ ties like C@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ de M@@ ak@@ el@@ ele , who played in the same position as me .
Is An@@ c@@ el@@ o@@ tt@@ i the man for the job ?
De@@ fin@@ it@@ ely .
An@@ c@@ el@@ o@@ tt@@ i in@@ spi@@ res respect among all the experts .
Today he has no e@@ qu@@ al in L@@ ig@@ ue 1 , and he 's one of the best co@@ a@@ ch@@ es in Europe .
He has m@@ as@@ s@@ es of experience and has won many tit@@ l@@ es with top c@@ lu@@ bs .
He 's worked with great players .
I think he will bring more tit@@ l@@ es to Paris .
In January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I was just coming back from a series of injuries .
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance .
What importance do you att@@ a@@ ch to the first part of the season for P@@ S@@ G ?
In L@@ ig@@ ue 1 , L@@ y@@ on over@@ took us at the top .
But we 're waiting on the sidelines .
One of our main go@@ als is the Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League : we qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied for the last 16 in the right way .
What is the club 's goal in this competition ?
We 'll try to go as far as possible .
From now on , anything can happen .
But we 'll have something to say against some very good European teams .
First of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of P@@ or@@ to , to have home advantage in the last 16 match .
C@@ an P@@ S@@ G become a top European club in the short term ?
It already has the b@@ u@@ d@@ get ...
To become a top European club , Paris ne@@ e@@ ds to win tit@@ l@@ es and keep it up over time .
Today , this isn 't the case .
Fin@@ an@@ c@@ i@@ ally , P@@ S@@ G has the m@@ e@@ ans to make it happen .
In L@@ ig@@ ue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ?
De@@ fin@@ it@@ ely , it would be a major disap@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment .
This year , we 're really committed to winning the championship .
We weren 't far away last season .
In May , there was great disap@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment because we were good enough to finish first .
It was a terrific season .
We finished with 7@@ 9 points .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , 7@@ 9 points is good enough to be top ...
But another team , Mon@@ t@@ p@@ el@@ li@@ er , had an even more fantastic season .
I think this is the year .
Even if big teams like Mar@@ se@@ ille , L@@ y@@ on and B@@ or@@ de@@ a@@ u@@ x are competing for the title , I think we have the weapons to win .
D@@ o you think the media expect too much of P@@ S@@ G ?
It 's n@@ or@@ m@@ al for them to expect a lot from us given what 's been invested and the players we have .
We totally accept it .
After we won 4@@ -@@ 0 at home against T@@ ro@@ y@@ es and they still found things to b@@ l@@ am@@ e us for , that 's de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely a bit f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating .
You w@@ on@@ der what more people expect .
You 're never going to win 4@@ -@@ 0 every weekend .
We 're not FC Barcelona !
We 're trying to im@@ p@@ le@@ ment a game project .
It takes time to build a team .
The Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League proved we could hold our own .
L@@ oo@@ k at M@@ an@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ er City who , for two seasons , have failed to qualify for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
Based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break !
That would be to ign@@ or@@ e our opponents and the French Championship .
L@@ y@@ on and Mar@@ se@@ ille , who were no good last season , were " b@@ oo@@ sted " by the new P@@ S@@ G .
This shows that L@@ ig@@ ue 1 is e@@ x@@ c@@ it@@ ing .
I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
P@@ S@@ G seem totally dependent on the explo@@ its of Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vi@@ c .
So much so that people say there is a " Z@@ lat@@ an de@@ p@@ en@@ den@@ ce . "
This m@@ e@@ ans I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vi@@ c is very successful and scores a lot of go@@ als .
That 's why he came , and he 's p@@ ro@@ ving he 's the star of L@@ ig@@ ue 1 .
He 's de@@ m@@ on@@ str@@ ated e@@ very@@ where he went that he was a great player , a world star .
Wi@@ th@@ in the group , we respect the man and the player .
And also he respects the men he has around him .
What he has done is truly e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ tional .
It p@@ ush@@ es others to raise their level of play .
Th@@ i@@ ago Sil@@ v@@ a , who is one of the best def@@ en@@ der@@ s in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ?
A disap@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment .
I really wanted to play in this Euro .
Un@@ f@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ ately , my injury pre@@ vent@@ ed me from getting any game time .
I saw some things there and came out str@@ on@@ ger .
Today , I 'm playing well in selection m@@ at@@ ches .
Which is what I 've been hoping for since my b@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ ism with the B@@ lu@@ es .
I 've learned the l@@ es@@ s@@ on@@ s from what ha@@ p@@ p@@ en@@ ed in the U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ ine and I now ow@@ e it to myself to have e@@ x@@ em@@ pl@@ ar@@ y be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our .
What do think about Didier Des@@ ch@@ am@@ p@@ s 's first few months in charge of the B@@ lu@@ es ?
He has the results he wanted .
We 're well plac@@ ed in the World qualifying group .
The coach is t@@ ou@@ gh , close to the players , and in@@ spi@@ res them to win .
Li@@ k@@ e L@@ a@@ u@@ rent B@@ l@@ an@@ c was .
But I don 't want to make any com@@ par@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ s .
B@@ l@@ an@@ c had achieved his goal when we qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied for the Euro .
I hope Didier Des@@ ch@@ am@@ p@@ s will take the B@@ lu@@ es to B@@ r@@ a@@ z@@ il .
Did the good draw ( 1-@@ 1 ) s@@ n@@ at@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , re@@ present a fo@@ unding match ?
That match gave us confidence .
E@@ very@@ body fought for e@@ very@@ body .
Be@@ f@@ or@@ e that sh@@ o@@ ck in Spain , I 'd never e@@ x@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed such a match in my career .
With B@@ it@@ co@@ in , pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current m@@ on@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y e@@ x@@ changes , based on central banks , identified trans@@ actions and p@@ ro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ing fees among the parties involved .
In addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is p@@ al@@ p@@ able : the belief that the current m@@ on@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y system , made up of banking m@@ on@@ op@@ o@@ li@@ es , le@@ ads to financial c@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ es .
In fact , B@@ it@@ co@@ in , in@@ v@@ ent@@ ed by S@@ at@@ o@@ sh@@ i N@@ ak@@ am@@ o@@ to ( a p@@ se@@ ud@@ on@@ ym ) , is both a v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al currency ( but con@@ v@@ er@@ ti@@ ble into dollars , e@@ u@@ ro@@ s ) and a secure exchange p@@ ro@@ to@@ co@@ l like B@@ it@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ pe@@ er f@@ ile exchange .
A@@ round 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 trans@@ actions have already been recorded vi@@ a 15@@ ,000 computers on the network .
Close to a th@@ ou@@ s@@ and w@@ e@@ b sites accept bit@@ co@@ ins as don@@ ations or m@@ e@@ ans of payment .
The bit@@ co@@ in exchange rate , after re@@ a@@ ch@@ ing a pe@@ ak of 30 dollars ( 23 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s ) in June 20@@ 11 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , re@@ turning today to around a dozen dollars ( rates are li@@ sted on the bit@@ co@@ in@@ char@@ t@@ s@@ .com site ) .
N@@ o@@ thing very impressive , compared to global trans@@ actions in real currency or financial products .
However , the European Centr@@ al Bank ( E@@ C@@ B ) took an interest in it in a report on v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al cur@@ ren@@ c@@ i@@ es published in October .
It des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es bit@@ co@@ in as " the most successful v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al currency , " " in competition with the dollar or the euro " and " similar to con@@ ven@@ tional cur@@ ren@@ c@@ i@@ es . "
B@@ it@@ co@@ in di@@ f@@ f@@ ers from other types of v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al currency such as ' c@@ re@@ dits ' , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
The social network Fac@@ e@@ b@@ oo@@ k has also developed this kind of system .
But , on each o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on , a central authority controls and h@@ an@@ d@@ l@@ es the e@@ x@@ changes .
With B@@ it@@ co@@ in , all n@@ o@@ des in the network are both c@@ u@@ st@@ o@@ di@@ ans of the book of accounts , a@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ ors , currency i@@ s@@ su@@ ers , and buyers and s@@ ell@@ ers .
How does the network op@@ er@@ ate ?
Each trans@@ action between two us@@ ers is actually carried out between two el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic ad@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ es like with an e-mail .
Except that a us@@ er can choose a different address for each payment , there@@ by en@@ s@@ ur@@ ing an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity .
A set of information associated with this trans@@ action is signed el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ically by a du@@ al-@@ key en@@ cr@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ on system .
So the network can v@@ er@@ i@@ f@@ y the a@@ u@@ th@@ en@@ tic@@ ity of the trans@@ action .
U@@ sing the contents of the f@@ ile , it is also possible to ensure that the e@@ x@@ changed bit@@ co@@ ins exist in the public book of accounts , bro@@ ad@@ cast across the en@@ ti@@ re network .
The key step is entering the new trans@@ action in the book .
It passes through the resolution of a mathemati@@ cal challenge issued to the computers , and the win@@ ner , a kind of inter@@ im central b@@ an@@ ker , will have the privilege of adding this e@@ x@@ tra line .
This is a f@@ ile h@@ ash@@ ing ph@@ as@@ e , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the transformation of a large f@@ ile into a shor@@ ter and uni@@ que di@@ g@@ it@@ al im@@ p@@ r@@ int .
Com@@ p@@ u@@ ters " take " the new trans@@ action and add a number to it , then " h@@ ash " it all up .
The goal being to find the number that gives a special im@@ p@@ r@@ int ( lo@@ ts of zer@@ os at the beginning ) .
Once this number has been found , the other n@@ o@@ des can easily ch@@ ec@@ k that it is the right one .
The trans@@ action is then in@@ de@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ti@@ b@@ ly linked to the chain of all the other trans@@ actions ; any mo@@ di@@ fication would al@@ ter the im@@ p@@ r@@ int .
If a us@@ er wanted to de@@ fraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two trans@@ actions would be v@@ al@@ i@@ d@@ ated by the network - the other would remain an or@@ ph@@ an because the two have different im@@ p@@ r@@ in@@ ts .
The computer that re@@ sol@@ ves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ co@@ ins .
To avo@@ id inflation , this award is regularly di@@ vi@@ ded by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
The number of bit@@ co@@ ins in c@@ ir@@ c@@ ul@@ ation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are di@@ visible down to the hundred m@@ illi@@ on@@ th , which leaves some margin ...
The di@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ul@@ ty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in com@@ p@@ ut@@ ing power .
The life of the network has had its u@@ p@@ s and down@@ s .
W@@ e@@ b@@ sites p@@ ro@@ vi@@ ding services for B@@ it@@ co@@ in have been attacked and bit@@ co@@ ins in deposits st@@ ol@@ en .
" The lo@@ op@@ hole used is not the p@@ ro@@ to@@ co@@ l itself " says Pierre N@@ o@@ iz@@ at re@@ as@@ s@@ ur@@ ingly , who has just launched P@@ ay@@ m@@ i@@ um , a real currency payment company that us@@ es the B@@ it@@ co@@ in network .
The E@@ C@@ B also highlights the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ es of money la@@ un@@ der@@ ing us@@ ing this an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ou@@ s service .
But cash also has this w@@ e@@ ak@@ n@@ ess .
Ma@@ j@@ or players like W@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ pe@@ dia re@@ f@@ use don@@ ations of this nature .
Others , such as the W@@ or@@ d@@ Press blog platform , accept them .
Rec@@ ent@@ ly , Ad@@ i Sh@@ am@@ ir and D@@ or@@ it Ron , from the W@@ e@@ i@@ z@@ man@@ n Institute in Israel , an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ ed the ac@@ co@@ un@@ ting b@@ oo@@ ks and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ co@@ ins do not c@@ ir@@ c@@ ul@@ ate .
In November , " huge s@@ ell@@ -@@ offs " were launched .
" Th@@ ir@@ ty th@@ ou@@ s@@ and dollars were e@@ x@@ changed " w@@ el@@ comes Jon H@@ ol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for C@@ o@@ in@@ ab@@ u@@ l , which con@@ v@@ er@@ ts bit@@ co@@ ins to gold .
Pierre N@@ o@@ iz@@ at , also a@@ u@@ th@@ or of an e@@ du@@ c@@ ational book on this currency , has a lot of f@@ a@@ it@@ h in the potential of this technology as a trans@@ action network .
His system , P@@ ay@@ t@@ un@@ ia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a con@@ t@@ act@@ less payment by mobile , but it us@@ es B@@ it@@ co@@ in to v@@ al@@ i@@ date trans@@ actions , which are th@@ us ch@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ er .
Also the us@@ er man@@ ag@@ es his id@@ ent@@ ity and can therefore be an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ou@@ s .
The system is easy to im@@ p@@ le@@ ment by mer@@ ch@@ an@@ ts , who do not need to in@@ st@@ all new terminals or software .
They just need to provide an address that a phone can " photograph and recognise " says Pierre N@@ o@@ iz@@ at , who con@@ f@@ ir@@ ms he has thousands of us@@ ers .
There is a general movement to re@@ app@@ raise h@@ i@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ ical systems for more h@@ or@@ iz@@ on@@ t@@ al systems .
" It will take time for B@@ it@@ co@@ in to become f@@ ir@@ m@@ ly established , but 20@@ 13 could be a turning point , " he pre@@ di@@ c@@ ts .
The E@@ C@@ B , in its report , says it will re@@ as@@ s@@ ess the v@@ ar@@ ious risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency 's success .
We got out of A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an .
What now ?
French troops have left their area of re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an ( K@@ a@@ p@@ i@@ s@@ a and S@@ u@@ ro@@ b@@ i ) .
NAT@@ O and the Americans are due to follow in late 20@@ 14 .
It is time for the Afghan army to re@@ su@@ me possession of its ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y and the Afghan people to choose their future , without e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ting us to do everything .
It is mainly Afghan pe@@ as@@ an@@ ts that we have punished by regarding them as ter@@ r@@ or@@ ists .
And ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wounded , the m@@ a@@ im@@ ed .
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former leaders in re@@ f@@ u@@ ge in P@@ ak@@ i@@ st@@ an , but often pe@@ as@@ an@@ ts who re@@ f@@ use the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the S@@ o@@ vie@@ ts .
They want to defend their tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s , both an@@ c@@ i@@ ent and ar@@ ch@@ a@@ ic , even though they have been joined by J@@ i@@ ha@@ di@@ st@@ s , P@@ ak@@ i@@ st@@ an@@ is , Arab@@ s , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , T@@ a@@ j@@ i@@ ks .
T@@ ol@@ er@@ ated , sometimes as@@ si@@ sted , by local in@@ s@@ ur@@ g@@ ent@@ s , the latter will no longer be so when W@@ e@@ st@@ ern@@ ers become more sc@@ ar@@ ce .
The departure of French troops from the N@@ i@@ j@@ r@@ a@@ b base , which I observed from the top of h@@ ill@@ s of al@@ mond trees pl@@ an@@ ted with French f@@ un@@ ding , was carried out in an or@@ der@@ ly fashion .
Con@@ vo@@ ys of trucks and ar@@ m@@ oured vehicles re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed Kabul without being attacked , over@@ f@@ lo@@ w@@ n by helicopters .
There will be no wave of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 20@@ 14 .
C@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ an@@ ces have changed since their ir@@ resist@@ ible advance between 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 and 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 .
At that time Kabul was em@@ p@@ ty , the country being torn a@@ p@@ art by the st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ es between different f@@ ac@@ tions .
Their t@@ ak@@ e@@ over of the country had been per@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ed then as a sort of liber@@ ation , a return to safety .
A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ is paid the price of the obsc@@ ur@@ an@@ t@@ ism of these pe@@ as@@ an@@ ts by the or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation of Al-@@ Qaeda , but their situation has not improved today .
Former Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ id@@ in , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are al@@ li@@ ed in the des@@ ir@@ e to keep women in an in@@ fer@@ i@@ or position .
The main an@@ ti@@ -So@@ vie@@ t war leaders re@@ turned to power in 2001 .
They became p@@ ro@@ f@@ it@@ e@@ ers , s@@ e@@ i@@ z@@ ing government land to re@@ sell as building land to re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es re@@ turning from Iran and P@@ ak@@ i@@ st@@ an , b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ it@@ ing from huge American out@@ so@@ ur@@ c@@ ing con@@ tr@@ acts .
They have become di@@ sc@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ ed ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves .
The people , as I heard in the country@@ side , want a Government that is not made up of th@@ i@@ e@@ ves .
Many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American l@@ ar@@ g@@ es@@ se will leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
The young people are tired of war and its i@@ de@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es .
They have rub@@ bed sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s with the modern world during their exile in Iran or P@@ ak@@ i@@ st@@ an , and a@@ p@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ated the benefits .
Rou@@ gh@@ ly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the to@@ t@@ al population .
In towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and bo@@ ys alike .
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obsc@@ ur@@ an@@ t@@ ism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders .
All of them , including the armed opponents , are par@@ ti@@ al to mobile ph@@ on@@ es ; television , with its T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish so@@ a@@ p op@@ er@@ as that show a modern world , is fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed e@@ very@@ where .
The army is now present .
Will the authorities who com@@ m@@ and it be considered le@@ g@@ it@@ im@@ ate ?
Former com@@ man@@ der@@ s of the an@@ ti@@ -So@@ vie@@ t st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ le are already thinking about restoring provincial militias , which will es@@ c@@ a@@ p@@ e the central power .
A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an , land of mountains , with strong local id@@ ent@@ it@@ i@@ es , should be able to benefit from a certain de@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ation , in the image of the Western n@@ ations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a c@@ ent@@ r@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed State , with strong presidential power , ab@@ ol@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing the post of Prime Minister , which had e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ed since the 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 4 Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on .
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on of the elections in April 20@@ 14 .
But , since the 5@@ 0@@ s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid .
No in@@ du@@ stri@@ es have been re-@@ established , no d@@ am@@ s are in good condition , no major ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation systems have been re@@ p@@ a@@ i@@ red .
Everything is im@@ p@@ or@@ ted ; nothing is produced , a@@ p@@ art from f@@ ru@@ it and vegetables .
The Pri@@ ority is left to private in@@ it@@ i@@ ative .
In a country ru@@ in@@ ed by th@@ ir@@ ty years of war , government control over the in@@ f@@ r@@ a@@ structure would have been necessary .
The ru@@ m@@ our was sp@@ re@@ ad that A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an had huge m@@ in@@ er@@ al wealth .
This only added to the feeling that the W@@ e@@ st@@ ern@@ ers were only there to s@@ e@@ i@@ ze it .
With no energy to process the ir@@ on or@@ e or cop@@ per on site , or m@@ e@@ ans of tr@@ an@@ sport to e@@ x@@ p@@ or@@ t it across the mountains , there is no m@@ in@@ ing .
The Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak cop@@ per m@@ ine , leaving international ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ ologists ( f@@ un@@ ded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist site and remain the largest em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ers in the province .
One day it will also be necessary for A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an and P@@ ak@@ i@@ st@@ an , on which im@@ p@@ or@@ ts and e@@ x@@ p@@ or@@ ts largely de@@ p@@ end , to restore n@@ or@@ m@@ al relations .
The departure of French com@@ b@@ at troops was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation tre@@ at@@ y provides for the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ation of traditional aid : girls ' high school , bo@@ ys ' high school , French Department at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and ag@@ ri@@ cultural fields , support to the ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ ological Delegation .
Since 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 , to try to " win h@@ e@@ ar@@ ts and m@@ in@@ ds " and achieve the im@@ possible t@@ ask of re@@ conc@@ iling aid and off@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e actions , a " c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ -@@ military actions " service from the Ministry of def@@ ence ( C@@ im@@ ic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French N@@ G@@ O , many community and ag@@ ri@@ cultural re@@ hab@@ il@@ itation projects in dozens of mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in v@@ ill@@ ag@@ es .
These projects , involving large numbers of local lab@@ our , have helped to contain the in@@ s@@ ur@@ gen@@ cy : ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation , w@@ ells , drinking water , re@@ fore@@ station , f@@ ru@@ it trees , so@@ il protection and increase in c@@ ul@@ tiv@@ able areas .
What will we leave as a sou@@ ven@@ ir , after two billion e@@ u@@ ro@@ s of military spending ?
A much more mo@@ dest b@@ u@@ d@@ get would contribute to im@@ p@@ ro@@ ving local living conditions , which are very hard in these v@@ al@@ le@@ ys often located over 2,000 m@@ e@@ t@@ res above sea level .
The E@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y has received dozens of w@@ r@@ it@@ ten re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s for small ag@@ ri@@ cultural projects from local communities in K@@ a@@ p@@ i@@ s@@ a province .
To be in a position to free themselves from the u@@ p@@ rising led by foreign groups , which is what far@@ m@@ ers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be m@@ a@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed in their favour , well con@@ tro@@ l@@ led and directly aff@@ ec@@ ting them .
A Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on by force in Egypt
A new gam@@ ble for President M@@ oh@@ am@@ m@@ ed Mor@@ si .
While Egypt remains more di@@ vi@@ ded than ever around the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional de@@ c@@ l@@ ar@@ ation , which te@@ m@@ p@@ or@@ ar@@ il@@ y grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
T@@ aking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ent A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly would vote on its final te@@ x@@ t the following day .
Just a week ago , the head of State had given the A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly two more months to finish its work .
For two years Egypt has re@@ li@@ ed on a p@@ ro@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on@@ al te@@ x@@ t , am@@ ended several times and this has w@@ e@@ ak@@ en@@ ed in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional st@@ ability and led to legal im@@ bro@@ g@@ li@@ os .
This new in@@ it@@ i@@ ative has only served to enhance the di@@ vi@@ de in the country .
According to his opponents , the President is per@@ se@@ v@@ er@@ ing in his " a@@ u@@ to@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c deli@@ ri@@ um , " continuing to " go back on his word " and ' tr@@ am@@ p@@ le the law . "
His supporters aff@@ ir@@ m that this is the quick@@ est way to put an end to the in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional and political crisis , by speeding up the trans@@ it@@ i@@ on process .
A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks .
A very short period , which forces the Brothers to ab@@ an@@ d@@ on their plan to explain the te@@ x@@ t , article by article , to the E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ ans .
For the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c le@@ g@@ it@@ im@@ acy while the disp@@ ute r@@ ag@@ es throughout the country .
M@@ oh@@ am@@ m@@ ed Mor@@ si seems con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ ans will vote f@@ a@@ vo@@ ur@@ ab@@ ly , as he st@@ ated in an interview with the American weekly Time .
P@@ ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly since a ha@@ st@@ y vote s@@ m@@ ac@@ ks of an ul@@ tim@@ at@@ um to the Egyptian people : " E@@ i@@ th@@ er you vote for my te@@ x@@ t , or I keep full powers , " these powers su@@ p@@ po@@ se@@ d@@ ly e@@ x@@ p@@ ir@@ ing following ad@@ option of the Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on .
It was in a st@@ range atmosphere that 85 members of the Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ent A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly , with a large I@@ s@@ lam@@ ist majority , vo@@ ted on the te@@ x@@ t yesterday .
Most of the liberals were missing .
In mid-@@ November , shortly before the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional de@@ c@@ l@@ ar@@ ation , they had sl@@ am@@ m@@ ed the do@@ or , feeling they had failed to as@@ s@@ er@@ t their vie@@ ws .
Representatives of human rights , religious m@@ in@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ es or civil society had done li@@ ke@@ w@@ ise .
In order to ob@@ ta@@ in a qu@@ or@@ um , 11 members , al@@ ter@@ n@@ at@@ es , were ha@@ st@@ il@@ y added yesterday morning .
Some of them are very close to the Muslim B@@ ro@@ th@@ er@@ hood .
Not s@@ ur@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ ingly , the ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es were for the most part vo@@ ted un@@ anim@@ ously .
Com@@ m@@ ent@@ at@@ ors were also am@@ used that one of the only di@@ v@@ er@@ sions of the day was expressed with re@@ g@@ ar@@ d to ... the hour of prayer , some Committee members feeling that the Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ent A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly c@@ lo@@ ck was w@@ r@@ ong .
The te@@ x@@ t , which was still being vo@@ ted on yesterday evening , has 2@@ 3@@ 4 ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es .
The main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final an@@ al@@ y@@ sis i@@ den@@ tic@@ al to that of the 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1 Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on , st@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating that " the p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of sh@@ ar@@ ia are the main source of law . "
The S@@ al@@ af@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace " the p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es " by " the r@@ ul@@ es , " which would have allowed stric@@ ter app@@ lic@@ ation .
For the I@@ s@@ lam@@ ists , the fact that this article was not am@@ ended is a g@@ u@@ ar@@ an@@ tee of their g@@ oo@@ d@@ will and their respect for the other el@@ em@@ ent@@ s of Egyptian society .
" H@@ y@@ po@@ c@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ y " respond the liberals , who see only a communication c@@ ou@@ p .
Because in their opinion I@@ s@@ lam@@ i@@ s@@ ation of the Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on is done through other ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es .
They re@@ fer in partic@@ ul@@ ar to article 2@@ 20 , which grants Al-@@ Az@@ h@@ ar University an advisory role , with partic@@ ul@@ ar reference to v@@ er@@ i@@ f@@ y@@ ing the con@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ity of the la@@ ws with sh@@ ar@@ ia .
According to Egypt specialist S@@ op@@ h@@ ie P@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ ier , this is wor@@ r@@ y@@ ing because " the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c le@@ g@@ it@@ im@@ acy .
This suggests the be@@ g@@ innings of a the@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ acy . "
The liberals ' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity will probably be much less moderate than the current one .
" For the time being , there is no concrete religious im@@ p@@ lic@@ ation .
With this Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on , things remain under civil rule .
Most of the lawyers who worked on this te@@ x@@ t are not Islamic law scholars but ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ics , some trained in the French system " qu@@ al@@ i@@ fi@@ es Ale@@ x@@ is Bl@@ ou@@ et , who is writing a thes@@ is on the Egyptian con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional trans@@ it@@ i@@ on .
But he ack@@ n@@ o@@ wle@@ d@@ g@@ es that " there may be some ambig@@ u@@ ity regarding article 2@@ 20 , because the terms used bor@@ row from the religious voc@@ ab@@ ulary .
Re@@ fer@@ ence is made in partic@@ ul@@ ar to " fi@@ q@@ h " [ Islamic j@@ ur@@ i@@ s@@ p@@ ru@@ den@@ ce , E@@ d@@ itor 's note ] .
And the question could be asked in future to what extent civil j@@ ud@@ g@@ es are com@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ ent to p@@ r@@ on@@ oun@@ ce on it . "
Be@@ y@@ on@@ d its religious as@@ p@@ ec@@ t , the te@@ x@@ t vo@@ ted on yesterday is highly c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Re@@ public .
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are si@@ gn@@ ific@@ an@@ t@@ ly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime .
Another issue : the powers con@@ fer@@ red on the army .
In ac@@ c@@ or@@ d@@ ance with the wishes of the military , the Defence b@@ u@@ d@@ get re@@ view will be not sub@@ mit@@ ted to P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent , but to a National Defence Council .
N@@ or will trials of civilians will be banned in military tri@@ b@@ un@@ als , as re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed by associations for the def@@ ence of human rights .
Who also voice their concerns about the te@@ x@@ t , which they consider re@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ e .
The off@@ ence of b@@ l@@ as@@ ph@@ em@@ y is m@@ a@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed and in@@ su@@ l@@ ts are now p@@ ro@@ h@@ ib@@ it@@ ed , which could have serious con@@ sequ@@ en@@ ces on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
In addition , no longer does any of the ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es re@@ fer to the protection of women , highlights H@@ e@@ b@@ a Mor@@ ay@@ e@@ f , from Human Rights Watch .
In her opinion , the only po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e point is the p@@ ro@@ h@@ ib@@ it@@ i@@ on of t@@ or@@ t@@ ure in article 36 .
The word was not included in the previous Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on .
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
Supporters of the H@@ e@@ ad of State will march on Saturday .
In Israel , holy plac@@ es a@@ wait U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ in@@ ian tourists , the o@@ m@@ p@@ hal@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water
The H@@ ol@@ y Land com@@ b@@ in@@ es the sp@@ l@@ en@@ d@@ our of b@@ ib@@ li@@ cal tru@@ ths , modern com@@ f@@ or@@ t and pri@@ m@@ e@@ v@@ al nature .
A@@ i@@ F [ Ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent@@ i i F@@ ak@@ ti ] newspaper high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted the five most important re@@ as@@ on@@ s why it is a must to visit Israel .
Let 's wor@@ ship the holy plac@@ es
It is worth v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ing the Ri@@ ver Jordan where J@@ es@@ us was b@@ a@@ p@@ ti@@ z@@ ed .
It is considered that all who enter this b@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ ism " b@@ ath " are b@@ l@@ essed by Go@@ d .
Gal@@ il@@ e@@ e is the place where J@@ es@@ us performed his mag@@ ic : turned water into wine at a wedding , walked on water , c@@ al@@ med a storm , and filled the nets .
This is also where J@@ es@@ us came before his di@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es and after the resurrec@@ ti@@ on .
But the biggest number of holy plac@@ es is in J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m .
Bel@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ er@@ s walk through the W@@ ay of G@@ ri@@ e@@ f or V@@ ia D@@ ol@@ or@@ os@@ a .
It starts by the An@@ t@@ on@@ ia For@@ t@@ re@@ s@@ s - Pra@@ e@@ t@@ ori@@ um - where the judgement took place , and brings us along the streets of the O@@ l@@ d T@@ own to the Ch@@ ur@@ ch of the H@@ ol@@ y S@@ ep@@ ul@@ ch@@ re on G@@ ol@@ go@@ th@@ a - the place of the cru@@ c@@ i@@ fix@@ ion , Stone of Un@@ ction and the place of J@@ es@@ us ' bur@@ ial .
This is also the lo@@ c@@ ation of the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ian o@@ m@@ p@@ hal@@ os , which sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ z@@ es the sal@@ v@@ ation of man@@ kind .
The H@@ ol@@ y C@@ ro@@ s@@ s Mon@@ ast@@ er@@ y in J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m is er@@ ec@@ ted at the site that , according to Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ian le@@ gen@@ d , y@@ i@@ el@@ ded the tre@@ e used to make the c@@ ro@@ s@@ s for J@@ es@@ us ' cru@@ c@@ i@@ fix@@ ion .
J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m has the most holy plac@@ es for the Jews as well - the W@@ a@@ il@@ ing Wall , which remained from a te@@ mp@@ le de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed by the R@@ o@@ m@@ ans in 70 A@@ D .
According to tradition , people of different f@@ a@@ i@@ ths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then f@@ ul@@ filled .
Travel along a v@@ er@@ tic@@ al
R@@ u@@ ins of the M@@ as@@ sa@@ d@@ a For@@ t@@ re@@ s@@ s remain from a secret re@@ f@@ u@@ ge from en@@ em@@ ies , built by H@@ er@@ o@@ d in 25 B@@ C for his family .
They are located on cli@@ f@@ f@@ s in the mountains at an el@@ e@@ v@@ ation of 4@@ 50 m above sea level .
They can be re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed on foot only by those who are into mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in clim@@ b@@ ing .
Others are delivered to this historical mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ top by a c@@ ab@@ le@@ way .
In the north of the country , at an el@@ e@@ v@@ ation of 16@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ 20@@ 40 m , there is a fam@@ ou@@ s sk@@ i re@@ s@@ or@@ t called H@@ er@@ m@@ on , which f@@ ill@@ s up with tourists in winter months .
A shuttle b@@ us brings people to it from the foot of the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in .
The to@@ t@@ al length of sk@@ i p@@ i@@ st@@ es is 45 km .
According to an an@@ c@@ i@@ ent le@@ gen@@ d , p@@ agan go@@ ds used to live on the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in .
V@@ i@@ s@@ it uni@@ que m@@ u@@ se@@ um@@ s
This country has about 300 m@@ u@@ se@@ um@@ s .
You won 't be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing on@@ es are worth a visit .
Among them - Museum of Israel , located close to K@@ n@@ es@@ set ( P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent ) .
It has an@@ c@@ i@@ ent Q@@ um@@ ran man@@ us@@ c@@ ri@@ p@@ ts and Dead Sea sc@@ rolls found in the c@@ av@@ es of the Ju@@ de@@ an desert , along with about 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ ological and an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ical ar@@ te@@ facts .
The Museum of Art in T@@ el@@ -@@ A@@ vi@@ v is also inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing .
Its e@@ x@@ h@@ ib@@ its include a wide range of impres@@ si@@ on@@ ists and e@@ x@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on@@ ists like Mon@@ et , P@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ r@@ o , Ren@@ o@@ ir , S@@ i@@ s@@ ley , C@@ e@@ z@@ ann@@ e , M@@ at@@ i@@ s@@ se , Mo@@ di@@ g@@ li@@ ani , Ch@@ ag@@ all , Pic@@ as@@ so .
In Ak@@ ko , you can visit the b@@ ath museum Al@@ -B@@ ash@@ a , which con@@ si@@ st@@ s of several rooms of an@@ c@@ i@@ ent T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish b@@ a@@ th@@ s with mo@@ d@@ el@@ s of visitors and b@@ ath at@@ ten@@ d@@ an@@ ts of the time .
In C@@ a@@ es@@ area , it is worth v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ing the uni@@ que private R@@ all@@ i Museum , where you can enjoy the sculptures of D@@ al@@ i and Ro@@ d@@ in .
There are no t@@ our g@@ u@@ ides or gift shops .
En@@ try is free of charge , and con@@ tri@@ b@@ u@@ tions are strictly not allowed .
The fifth one is the H@@ ol@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ t Museum or Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ e@@ m in T@@ el@@ -@@ A@@ vi@@ v , which t@@ ells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
The most tragic section is the children 's memorial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ation camps and gas ch@@ am@@ bers .
You go in and find yo@@ ur@@ self in complete d@@ ar@@ k@@ n@@ ess .
St@@ ars are g@@ li@@ m@@ mer@@ ing ,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died .
U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ ine is mentioned there too .
W@@ ell@@ n@@ ess
There are three re@@ s@@ or@@ t areas in Israel , located on the co@@ asts of the M@@ e@@ d@@ it@@ er@@ r@@ an@@ ean , Red , and Dead S@@ e@@ as .
Each have s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing po@@ ol@@ s , a@@ qu@@ a par@@ ks , d@@ ol@@ ph@@ in@@ ar@@ ia and o@@ c@@ e@@ an@@ ar@@ ia .
It is n@@ o@@ table that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water te@@ m@@ per@@ ature does not drop below 21 de@@ g@@ re@@ es and the air war@@ ms to 23 de@@ g@@ re@@ es .
The Dead Sea is even war@@ m@@ er , and people swim in it all year round .
In@@ c@@ i@@ dent@@ ally , it is the most un@@ usual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the pl@@ an@@ et - 4@@ 17 m below sea level .
Its a@@ z@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily ke@@ ep@@ s you af@@ lo@@ at , even if you don 't know how to swim .
The s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unding landscap@@ es are surreal in their beauty .
People come here to un@@ der@@ go a course of treatment us@@ ing salt water - w@@ r@@ a@@ ps and m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ in@@ al m@@ u@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have der@@ m@@ at@@ it@@ is , all@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ es , as@@ th@@ m@@ as , ec@@ z@@ em@@ as , ar@@ th@@ r@@ it@@ is , b@@ r@@ on@@ ch@@ it@@ is , or diabetes , or to return emo@@ tional balance .
Touch the m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ ies of an@@ ti@@ qu@@ ity
They are pre@@ served in the old section of T@@ el@@ -@@ A@@ vi@@ v - in the town of J@@ aff@@ a on the M@@ e@@ d@@ it@@ er@@ r@@ an@@ ean Sea .
The fam@@ ou@@ s sea rou@@ te con@@ ne@@ c@@ ting Egypt , Syria , An@@ at@@ o@@ li@@ a , and Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia runs through it .
The city is mentioned in an@@ c@@ i@@ ent G@@ re@@ ek and an@@ c@@ i@@ ent Egyptian le@@ gen@@ ds .
According to le@@ gen@@ ds , this is where N@@ o@@ ah built his ar@@ k and Per@@ se@@ us saved the beauty An@@ dro@@ m@@ e@@ d@@ a , with whom he lived a long and happy life .
T@@ o@@ ur@@ ists really like to w@@ an@@ der the n@@ ar@@ row streets named after signs of the zo@@ di@@ a@@ c .
They say , if you touch the walls on the stre@@ et of your sign , fortune will come to you .
In J@@ aff@@ a , you can meet new@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ e@@ ds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for p@@ h@@ o@@ to sessions .
And in C@@ a@@ es@@ area - the city of King H@@ er@@ o@@ d - you can walk around a R@@ o@@ m@@ an the@@ at@@ re , " c@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ ure " the Cr@@ us@@ a@@ der f@@ or@@ t@@ re@@ s@@ s .
During the R@@ o@@ m@@ an period , C@@ a@@ es@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ de@@ a and the re@@ si@@ den@@ ce of R@@ o@@ m@@ an pre@@ f@@ ec@@ ts , including Pon@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ ate .
The c@@ are@@ fully re@@ st@@ o@@ red the@@ at@@ re is now used for evening conc@@ er@@ ts and opera performances .
A note for the to@@ ur@@ ist
When you go to Israel , don 't wor@@ ry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country 's population sp@@ e@@ ak@@ s R@@ us@@ si@@ an .
For the trip , it is better to take dollars , not e@@ u@@ ro@@ s , because they are easily e@@ x@@ changed for sh@@ e@@ k@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3@@ .@@ 8 sh@@ e@@ k@@ els ) .
City tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation is mainly buses , but J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m has a high@@ -@@ speed tra@@ m , and Ha@@ i@@ f@@ a has the only sub@@ way line in the country , com@@ p@@ rising six st@@ ops and con@@ ne@@ c@@ ting u@@ pper town with lower .
In es@@ sen@@ ce , it is an underground cable r@@ a@@ il@@ way .
A ticket for any t@@ y@@ p@@ e of city tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation costs 6 sh@@ e@@ k@@ els , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers .
According to the Jewish tradition , S@@ ab@@ b@@ ath is celebrated in Israel .
Between Friday evening and the sun@@ set on Saturday , m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets , stores , and public tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ t@@ ation stop working .
The work week starts on Sunday morning .
Many c@@ af@@ es , restaurants and h@@ o@@ tel@@ s have only k@@ o@@ sh@@ er food , with no p@@ or@@ k , se@@ af@@ ood , fish with no sc@@ ales , or di@@ sh@@ es that combine m@@ il@@ k with meat .
There is a wide selection of di@@ sh@@ es from lam@@ b and beef , sou@@ ps and des@@ s@@ er@@ ts co@@ o@@ k@@ ed us@@ ing co@@ con@@ u@@ t m@@ il@@ k , traditional Jewish h@@ um@@ m@@ us p@@ a@@ st@@ e , v@@ ar@@ ious s@@ a@@ u@@ ces , f@@ al@@ af@@ el ( ball@@ s made of ground ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as ) , f@@ ru@@ its and vegetables .
The streets of Israel don 't have h@@ o@@ m@@ el@@ ess dogs .
But there are many w@@ ell@@ -@@ f@@ ed c@@ ats , which walk around la@@ z@@ il@@ y .
In the evening , they can even be seen sleeping on roo@@ f@@ s of par@@ ked cars .
These p@@ us@@ sy@@ c@@ ats like b@@ us@@ y plac@@ es and do not re@@ f@@ use tre@@ ats .
C@@ ar r@@ ent@@ al , de@@ p@@ en@@ ding on car t@@ y@@ p@@ e , costs from 37 ( H@@ y@@ un@@ d@@ a@@ i G@@ e@@ t@@ z ) to 18@@ 8 ( Au@@ d@@ i A@@ 6 , V@@ ol@@ v@@ o S@@ 80 ) dollars a day .
P@@ lu@@ s insurance of 15 dollars a day .
Bi@@ k@@ e r@@ ent@@ al costs 15 sh@@ e@@ k@@ els a day .
Museum entrance costs 30 sh@@ e@@ k@@ els on average .
In numbers
In 2012 , over three million tourists from around the world v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ed Israel .
Visitors and h@@ o@@ li@@ d@@ ay@@ m@@ ak@@ ers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , I@@ tal@@ y , England , and U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ ine .
Between January and October 2012 1@@ 18@@ ,@@ 800 U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ in@@ ian tourists v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ed the H@@ ol@@ y Land , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 20@@ 10 , before the re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the v@@ i@@ s@@ a regime on February 9 , 20@@ 11 .
Only the " high and m@@ ig@@ h@@ ty " make it to Moscow : mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts save money for language
While de@@ pu@@ ties and human rights activists argue about the pur@@ po@@ se of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has sc@@ am ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s who sell f@@ ak@@ e c@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ at@@ es .
Every year , 13 million mig@@ rant workers come to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia .
Mo@@ st@@ ly these are citizens of Centr@@ al A@@ si@@ a : U@@ z@@ be@@ k@@ i@@ st@@ an , T@@ a@@ j@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ st@@ an and T@@ ur@@ k@@ men@@ i@@ st@@ an .
Their only goal is to e@@ ar@@ n money to support families back home .
A new law came into effect on December 1 , which ob@@ li@@ g@@ es every mig@@ rant worker to pass a R@@ us@@ si@@ an language test .
For the moment , this law app@@ li@@ es only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility services , household services , and retail .
But with time - as p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed by the Federal M@@ ig@@ r@@ ation Service - tests will become mandatory for all n@@ on-@@ residents .
In addition to language , R@@ us@@ si@@ an history and b@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ s of the legal system will be tested .
Lan@@ g@@ u@@ age knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to e@@ x@@ tend the work permit .
An e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ on is in effect only for citizens of countries where R@@ us@@ si@@ an is a state language .
People who received education c@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ at@@ es and di@@ pl@@ o@@ m@@ as before the fall of the US@@ S@@ R in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 1 are also exempt under the law .
Pur@@ po@@ se , do@@ omed f@@ ate , and the protection of rights
S@@ even testing points will be operating under the a@@ u@@ sp@@ i@@ c@@ es of the P@@ ush@@ k@@ in Institute of R@@ us@@ si@@ an Lan@@ g@@ u@@ age , Pe@@ oples ' F@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St. Petersburg State University ( S@@ P@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other R@@ us@@ si@@ an education institutions .
M@@ ig@@ r@@ an@@ ts can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such c@@ ent@@ res have been opened .
The in@@ it@@ i@@ ative to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce the testing was su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted by State D@@ um@@ a members and the Federal M@@ ig@@ r@@ ation Services .
But human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
What will the obligation to know R@@ us@@ si@@ an change for the R@@ us@@ si@@ ans and for the n@@ on-@@ residents ?
First of all , according to re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ at@@ i@@ ves of the migration service , this will al@@ low to reduce the number of people su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing from lab@@ our s@@ la@@ very .
Many speak about protection of the rights of work mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts , explains the H@@ e@@ ad of the re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ ative office of the Federal M@@ ig@@ r@@ ation Services of Russia , V@@ i@@ k@@ tor S@@ e@@ b@@ el@@ e@@ v .
Rights protection should begin before their departure .
Only the system of or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed selection will enable us to sol@@ v@@ e 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
M@@ ig@@ r@@ an@@ ts without profession , education , who do not know R@@ us@@ si@@ an , who do not have a medical c@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate start to have problems .
If a mig@@ rant does not understand the language , says S@@ e@@ b@@ el@@ e@@ v with c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty , he is do@@ omed to come across un@@ con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ ou@@ s people , who , pre@@ ten@@ ding to help , will force upon him a " ticket " to ter@@ ri@@ ble , cr@@ am@@ p@@ ed bar@@ r@@ ac@@ ks where many others like him will su@@ f@@ f@@ er without food and documents , s@@ la@@ ving away 1@@ 2@@ -@@ 14 hours a day .
We receive many com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ts from our mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts .
" They are p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are li@@ ed to , their p@@ as@@ sp@@ or@@ ts are taken , they are not paid what they were p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed , " con@@ f@@ ir@@ ms the H@@ e@@ ad of the Main M@@ ig@@ rant L@@ ab@@ our Administration of the M@@ ig@@ r@@ ation Service of T@@ a@@ j@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ st@@ an T@@ o@@ li@@ b S@@ har@@ i@@ po@@ v .
Not be an@@ g@@ r@@ y , bo@@ s@@ s !
N@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , many citizens of Centr@@ al Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , ad@@ m@@ it that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
N@@ at@@ ur@@ ally , this is not so much their f@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t , but due to po@@ v@@ er@@ ty : very few T@@ ur@@ ks , U@@ z@@ be@@ ks , and T@@ a@@ j@@ i@@ ks can afford even a b@@ a@@ si@@ c education .
Their families don 't even have food to fe@@ ed their children , not to men@@ ti@@ on de@@ cent c@@ lo@@ thing , shoes , and supplies .
After re@@ a@@ ch@@ ing adol@@ es@@ c@@ ence , these k@@ ids go to work at the first opportunity .
It is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they ad@@ m@@ it .
" You feel h@@ um@@ ili@@ ated and in@@ fer@@ i@@ or . "
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language .
Test@@ ing will be conducted only for those mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts who have legal status .
If they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future .
In the m@@ e@@ an@@ time , most of the mig@@ rant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
" W@@ el@@ come , or No Un@@ a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ iz@@ ed En@@ try "
Many of the fore@@ ign@@ ers as@@ s@@ er@@ t that receiving official status in our country is not that easy .
The reason li@@ es in b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c h@@ ur@@ d@@ l@@ es and the already mentioned language difficulties .
In addition , le@@ g@@ alization costs money : from 12,000 to 16,000 rub@@ l@@ es .
W@@ her@@ e@@ as a f@@ ak@@ e re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation is done quickly and costs only one and a half th@@ ou@@ s@@ and .
O@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ers of the R@@ us@@ si@@ an Police know that we mainly have f@@ ak@@ e p@@ a@@ p@@ ers , without re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation , hence the e@@ x@@ t@@ or@@ ti@@ on .
" They ask for a hundred or two for c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es , te@@ a , " U@@ m@@ ed K@@ h@@ ush@@ k@@ ad@@ am@@ o@@ v , a c@@ it@@ i@@ zen of T@@ a@@ j@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ st@@ an , shared with journal@@ ists .
" Roll up , don 't be ch@@ e@@ a@@ p , get your art@@ work "
On the first day of the law 's ent@@ ry into effect it turned out that not only mig@@ rant re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation documents can be f@@ ak@@ e .
A few f@@ or@@ ged c@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ at@@ es about passing language tests have been seized by Federal M@@ ig@@ r@@ ation Services officers already .
For@@ ged documents are p@@ r@@ in@@ ted on a standard col@@ our p@@ r@@ in@@ ter .
N@@ at@@ ur@@ ally , they were not free for their owners : each of the mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts , who had hoped to f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the t@@ ask of passing the tests in this way paid seven th@@ ou@@ s@@ and rub@@ l@@ es for them .
It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three th@@ ou@@ s@@ and .
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the c@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ at@@ es could not just be bought .
For the moment , the authorities can promise mig@@ rant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a b@@ a@@ si@@ c language course .
In addition , those who come without R@@ us@@ si@@ an language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e active communication with people .
The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into c@@ ir@@ c@@ ul@@ ation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The R@@ us@@ si@@ an Ministry of the Interior is p@@ ro@@ po@@ s@@ ing to tou@@ g@@ h@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons .
This is the re@@ action of authorities to recent in@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ s : C@@ L@@ IC@@ K shots at w@@ e@@ d@@ d@@ ings , where there were no c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ties , and the m@@ as@@ s@@ ac@@ re st@@ ag@@ ed by Moscow lawyer D@@ mit@@ ry V@@ in@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ do@@ v , re@@ su@@ l@@ ting in C@@ L@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people .
Po@@ li@@ c@@ em@@ en want to p@@ ro@@ h@@ ib@@ it the carrying of weapons in public plac@@ es and raise the legal age of weapons lic@@ en@@ s@@ ing from 18 to 21 .
The idea was su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted by the head of the D@@ um@@ a Committee on Safety and Anti@@ -@@ Cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ti@@ on , I@@ r@@ in@@ a Y@@ ar@@ o@@ v@@ aya , who p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed that the am@@ en@@ d@@ ments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State D@@ um@@ a in the near future .
Not everyone is happy that the R@@ us@@ si@@ an authorities are trying to fight the problem by " ti@@ ghten@@ ing the sc@@ re@@ ws . "
An open letter appeared online , whose authors - re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ at@@ i@@ ves of different social ri@@ f@@ le organizations - demand to ab@@ an@@ d@@ on the " sen@@ s@@ el@@ ess tou@@ gh@@ en@@ ing . "
The per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of crime involving registered weapons is m@@ in@@ im@@ al , said criminal lawyer V@@ as@@ il@@ y L@@ es@@ n@@ i@@ k@@ o@@ v to BBC Russia .
According to the Ministry of the Interior 's statistics , 142 crimes us@@ ing fi@@ re@@ arms registered with law enforcement ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es have been committed in the six months of 2012 , w@@ h@@ er@@ e@@ as 1,@@ 16@@ 8,000 crimes have been recorded in to@@ t@@ al for this period .
Au@@ th@@ ors of the open letter are certain that the tou@@ gh@@ en@@ ing of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the " black " market .
According to them , one can find any weap@@ on at a low price right now .
N@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , the Ministry of the Interior as@@ s@@ er@@ ts that the situation of the sp@@ re@@ ad of illegal arms is under control .
Su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ ers : from plants to officers
The " black " market of weapons is re@@ pl@@ en@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ed through several ch@@ ann@@ els .
There are five such ch@@ ann@@ els , explains re@@ ti@@ red col@@ on@@ el V@@ i@@ k@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of E@@ du@@ c@@ ation and the General St@@ af@@ f for 10 years .
S@@ c@@ re@@ en@@ shot of the site that ac@@ c@@ ep@@ ts orders for weapons .
First : " army or military loo@@ t , " i@@ .@@ e@@ . weapons that were st@@ ol@@ en during the fighting in the C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ as@@ us .
" We@@ a@@ p@@ on@@ s were st@@ ol@@ en by R@@ us@@ si@@ an officers and by the C@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ ans , " says Bar@@ an@@ ets .
N@@ e@@ x@@ t are " black weapons , " st@@ ol@@ en by criminals from re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ at@@ i@@ ves of def@@ ence ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es .
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that this co@@ v@@ er@@ s weapons taken from police w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ s@@ es and those st@@ ol@@ en directly from law enforcement ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es ' employees .
I@@ l@@ legal arms are taken to be sold from military w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ s@@ es .
Ex@@ plo@@ sions have often been heard at military w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ s@@ es .
" There are p@@ ro@@ v@@ en the@@ or@@ ies that some of the fires were intentional , in order to cover the short@@ age , " says the former military man .
Manufacturers of weapons make their con@@ tri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets .
" There are so many private weapons f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ ies now , which do not en@@ d@@ ure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , " says the expert .
Another source of the " black " market is tra@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ king .
An especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like K@@ y@@ r@@ g@@ y@@ z@@ st@@ an .
" There 's production there , sometimes h@@ an@@ d@@ made ; and a m@@ af@@ ia has formed , which has or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed a stream , " explains the former military man .
Where do the weapons come from ?
Experts counted the appro@@ xim@@ ate share of each of the so@@ ur@@ ces of supply of illegal weapons to the " black " market .
A report about this was pre@@ p@@ a@@ red by the C@@ ent@@ re of Pro@@ ble@@ ms An@@ al@@ y@@ sis and Public Management P@@ l@@ anning in 20@@ 11 .
Experts an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ ed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Ro@@ s@@ stat , c@@ ri@@ m@@ in@@ ology lit@@ er@@ ature and open data from port@@ als on weapons .
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
Half of all arms on the black market are there " because of officials , whose work is con@@ ne@@ c@@ ted with weapons , " states the report .
According to researchers ' data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed con@@ fli@@ c@@ t areas , 14 % is theft during production , 5 % is " black ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ ology . "
A sales consultant of one of the weapons stores , who wished to remain an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ou@@ s , as@@ s@@ er@@ ts that the weapons found by " black " di@@ g@@ g@@ ers are not being bought any more , because they 're too old .
According to him , de@@ al@@ ers go to the military w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ se for a new b@@ at@@ ch of g@@ oo@@ ds .
One piece , for example a T@@ T g@@ u@@ n can be bought from a war@@ rant officer .
It is issued to him , and given through the fence .
" He takes it to the city and s@@ ells for 9@@ 00 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s a piece with two magazines , " he says .
" The tr@@ ut@@ h is that police are aw@@ are of everything , that is why per@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ c@@ ally , when the crime de@@ te@@ ction rate is low , it con@@ du@@ c@@ ts test pur@@ ch@@ as@@ es from illegal weapons mer@@ ch@@ an@@ ts , " says the consultant .
" Li@@ k@@ e in a lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y store "
The buyer and seller often find each other through friends .
I looked at sites , blogs , t@@ ill someone responded , off@@ er@@ ing me to go to Be@@ go@@ v@@ aya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the " cor@@ ner " so we can ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate .
I found out the price of the weap@@ on only there
military com@@ m@@ ent@@ ator V@@ i@@ k@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets
To get a weap@@ on , I need someone with con@@ ne@@ c@@ tions , says the sales consultant . - I have an ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ t@@ ance , but I 'm not sure it 's reliable .
There are sal@@ es@@ men on lab@@ our m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets , but one ne@@ e@@ ds to " come " there con@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally " from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a t@@ oo@@ th . "
R@@ ig@@ h@@ t now , even if I need a few k@@ n@@ u@@ ck@@ le@@ du@@ st@@ ers , I get them through someone I trust .
He also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won 't give him away .
Be@@ g@@ inners look for weapons in different ways .
Former military man V@@ i@@ k@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-@@ 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0 's , when he was pre@@ par@@ ing to p@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ ish an article about this .
The f@@ or@@ m@@ ul@@ as are still the same , according to him .
He was given an album of pictures with " anything and everything . "
" I felt like I was in a lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y store , " he rec@@ all@@ s .
According to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the buyer is not offered a p@@ i@@ g in a po@@ k@@ e - you can try out everything .
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the fore@@ s@@ t with the seller and set a target there .
" I am given the opportunity to shoot , and when I am certain that the weap@@ on is good , we begin to ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate , " des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es the expert .
St@@ or@@ e on a so@@ f@@ a
Internet sear@@ ches lead to sites and " V@@ k@@ on@@ t@@ ak@@ te " groups , where weapons " for different pur@@ po@@ s@@ es " are on offer .
No documents or per@@ s@@ on@@ al meetings are needed .
" It 's enough to have a certain su@@ m of money , " says the ad@@ v@@ er@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ em@@ ent heading on the website " Bu@@ y a pistol or ri@@ f@@ le . "
U@@ s@@ ers leave their re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s and ask questions .

M@@ ak@@ ar@@ o@@ v for 100 dollars
When buying illegal fi@@ re@@ arms , 100 to 9@@ 00 dollars is enough according to experts .
According to D@@ mit@@ ry Kis@@ lo@@ v from the Rights to We@@ a@@ p@@ on@@ s organization , a M@@ ak@@ ar@@ o@@ v g@@ u@@ n can be acquired for 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ 300 dollars .
The wait time is a month to a month and a half .
It is shipped from long-term st@@ or@@ age w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ s@@ es by the mid-@@ level management of these w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ s@@ es .
According to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to J@@ an@@ u@@ ar@@ y-@@ October 20@@ 11 , am@@ oun@@ ting to 2@@ 2@@ ,@@ 9@@ 00 , while the number of cases of theft and e@@ x@@ t@@ or@@ ti@@ on of weapons , am@@ m@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ on , explo@@ si@@ v@@ e sub@@ st@@ an@@ ces and explo@@ si@@ v@@ e de@@ v@@ i@@ c@@ es dropped by 7.@@ 8 % .
F@@ ast@@ -@@ food and super@@ market workers are on strike in the U.S.@@ A .
U@@ p to a fourth of all American te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers have worked the cash re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er at Mc@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d 's at one time or another
In the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U.S.@@ A. against low sal@@ ar@@ ies in supermarkets of the Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like Mc@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d 's , B@@ ur@@ ger King , T@@ ac@@ o Bell , W@@ en@@ d@@ y 's and Kentucky F@@ ri@@ ed Ch@@ i@@ c@@ ken .
R@@ ig@@ h@@ t now , n@@ o@@ body is able to pre@@ di@@ c@@ t whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is de@@ st@@ in@@ ed to fi@@ z@@ z@@ le out early .
A@@ c@@ tions are being su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted by un@@ i@@ on@@ s and a series of le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ wing organizations .
In addition to increasing the low w@@ ag@@ es received by employees of Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t and fast food chains , the goal of the p@@ ro@@ te@@ st@@ ers is to create un@@ i@@ on@@ s within them .
This sector of the economy is not co@@ v@@ er@@ ed by any union movement yet .
46 cents a year ?
A@@ c@@ tions began last week after Thanksgiving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
On this day , some employees of the Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t cor@@ p@@ or@@ ation , which employs 2.@@ 2 million people around the world , left their work@@ plac@@ es and p@@ ick@@ eted together with the un@@ i@@ on@@ s and le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ wing activists from the cor@@ p@@ or@@ ation stores that sell products to people on lo@@ w@@ -@@ to-@@ medi@@ um in@@ comes .
Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t s@@ ells everything im@@ ag@@ in@@ able , from di@@ a@@ p@@ ers , hun@@ ting ri@@ f@@ l@@ es and car b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies , to vac@@ u@@ um c@@ le@@ an@@ ers , eg@@ g@@ s and m@@ il@@ k .
Products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % ch@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ er than in major supermarkets .
So many lo@@ w@@ -@@ paid Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t employees shop only at their work@@ place .
A@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ ability and as@@ s@@ or@@ t@@ ment made Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t one of the biggest American cor@@ p@@ or@@ ations .
According to c@@ r@@ it@@ ics , Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t can afford to sell the products ch@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ ly partly because it p@@ ay@@ s little to its employees .
These latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand-@@ held sc@@ ann@@ ers .
Pro@@ te@@ st@@ ers on Black Friday de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ed a sal@@ ar@@ y increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the cor@@ p@@ or@@ ation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
A typical Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t employee , receiving 9@@ .@@ 5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
Sci@@ en@@ ti@@ st@@ s from the B@@ er@@ k@@ el@@ ey University in California argue that if Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t raises the average sal@@ ar@@ y to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the cor@@ p@@ or@@ ation 3@@ .@@ 2 billion dollars .
This is about 1.@@ 1 % more than it sp@@ ends on sal@@ ar@@ ies right now .
If Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t fully sh@@ i@@ f@@ ts the cost of increasing w@@ ag@@ es to the sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more .
In one year , they will only spend 1@@ 2.@@ 3@@ 9 dollars more than now .
Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t supporters ha@@ p@@ p@@ il@@ y note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the cor@@ p@@ or@@ ation .
Black Friday con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday t@@ ill midnight the next day , and during the period Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t sold about 5000 products a second .
In to@@ t@@ al , its cash re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ ers conducted nearly 100 million trans@@ actions on Black Friday .
Re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ ative of the cor@@ p@@ or@@ ation , D@@ an Fo@@ g@@ el@@ man , as@@ s@@ er@@ ted in an interview with a le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ wing site , the Huff@@ in@@ g@@ ton Post , that a to@@ t@@ al of " less than five " Wal@@ m@@ ar@@ t employees left the work@@ place , and the protest act was just " another PR tri@@ ck " of the union that or@@ g@@ an@@ iz@@ ed it .
" Free cash re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er ! "

Mc@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d 's says that it s@@ ells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for hon@@ est work !
J@@ um@@ a@@ ane Williams , member of the City Council of New York
At the moment , the minimum sal@@ ar@@ y according to federal and N@@ Y law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour .
Fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . On average their ordin@@ ar@@ y employees in New York e@@ ar@@ n 8@@ .@@ 90 dollars / hour .
Nobody e@@ ar@@ n@@ s less in this e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e city .
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money .
Once upon a time , almost a fourth of American te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers went through Mc@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d 's , working par@@ t@@ -@@ time after school , living with parents .
F@@ e@@ w saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long .
Now I con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ously come across interviews with Mc@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d 's employees , who complain that they have to survive on this sal@@ ar@@ y and sometimes even fe@@ ed their children .
On the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal f@@ or@@ um , whose a@@ u@@ th@@ or notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will fe@@ ed them .
P@@ ar@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ an@@ ts of the protest that began at 6@@ .@@ 30 a.m. on Thursday near the Mc@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d 's on 4@@ 0@@ th stre@@ et and Ma@@ di@@ son Avenue de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ed that cash@@ i@@ ers and co@@ o@@ ks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i@@ .@@ e@@ . more than double their present w@@ ag@@ es .
They also de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ed the c@@ re@@ ation of un@@ i@@ on@@ s in the fast food industry .
American law p@@ ro@@ h@@ ib@@ its the administration from pre@@ vent@@ ing this or pun@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing activists of the union movement by n@@ ag@@ ging or f@@ ir@@ ing .
On the other hand , the administration does not often e@@ as@@ e their life .
But for objective re@@ as@@ on@@ s it is hard to cover fast food with a union .
One of them is the un@@ usual tur@@ n@@ o@@ ver of employees .
Dis@@ ag@@ re@@ e@@ ing
N@@ o@@ i@@ s@@ y protests began on this day in a number of other ch@@ e@@ a@@ p restaurants in Manhattan .
The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near Mc@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d 's by Times Square , where several local de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans spoke out . One of them , J@@ um@@ a@@ ane Williams , said : " Mc@@ D@@ on@@ al@@ d 's claims it s@@ ells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for hon@@ est work ! "
Demonstr@@ at@@ ors were su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted by other prominent N@@ Y de@@ mo@@ c@@ r@@ at@@ s , like Bill de B@@ la@@ si@@ o , a candidate for N@@ Y city m@@ ay@@ or , who said : " We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair w@@ ag@@ es and economic w@@ ell@@ being , which every New Y@@ or@@ ker des@@ er@@ ves ! . "
According to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
But only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which com@@ p@@ rise ten@@ s of thousands of people in New York .
It is unclear right now whether this will spar@@ k a m@@ ass movement .
" At the moment , the mind cannot be de@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ed too well "
Among modern technology fans a popular t@@ op@@ ic is a@@ u@@ g@@ mented reality , lat@@ ely seen primarily through the p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ m of special gl@@ as@@ s@@ es .
At first , a functional model was sh@@ own by G@@ oo@@ g@@ le in the su@@ m@@ m@@ er , at its annual conference . Th@@ en , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an app@@ lic@@ ation for p@@ at@@ ent too .
However , according to the con@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ation with the leader of the group of inter@@ active 3@@ D technologies in the C@@ am@@ bri@@ dge laboratory of Microsoft , Sha@@ h@@ r@@ a@@ m I@@ z@@ ad@@ i , gl@@ as@@ s@@ es are a thing of the past for s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ st@@ s in this company .
They are drawn by the prospect of man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al objects in the air with bare hands , creating v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al open sp@@ ac@@ es .
- P@@ le@@ as@@ e tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does .
- We work on the inter@@ action of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the bo@@ und@@ ar@@ ies of this inter@@ action .
While people in general are st@@ u@@ ck at working with p@@ i@@ x@@ els on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them .
We want to look 5-@@ 10 years into the future and pre@@ di@@ c@@ t car@@ d@@ in@@ al changes in this inter@@ action .
For example , X@@ bo@@ x and K@@ in@@ ec@@ t sen@@ s@@ ors are a step forward . Al@@ most no X@@ bo@@ x is sold without K@@ in@@ ec@@ t today , because everyone likes control by g@@ e@@ st@@ u@@ res .
- What else a@@ wa@@ its us in the future ?
- Despite the fact that K@@ in@@ ec@@ t sh@@ i@@ f@@ ted the inter@@ action to the physical level , much still o@@ c@@ cur@@ s on a flat screen , sometimes in 3@@ D .
In@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ation ent@@ ry has improved ( the system receives more data ) , but output still ne@@ e@@ ds to get better .
We are trying to change this , working on truly th@@ re@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ al display systems based on v@@ ar@@ ious technologies , including projection technologies .
We need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tan@@ g@@ i@@ ble .
But for this , we need to identify both the us@@ er and the sp@@ ace around him .
Th@@ en we will be able to su@@ p@@ p@@ le@@ ment the real world with v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al objects in a much more con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent form .
A@@ bo@@ v@@ e all , get ri@@ d of these st@@ u@@ p@@ id v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al reality h@@ el@@ m@@ ets !
- What do you think about voice control ?
It 's a popular thing , but is it over@@ estimated ?
- It clearly cannot be called a c@@ u@@ re-@@ for-@@ all - there 's a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and in@@ ten@@ tions .
In reality , all types of inter@@ action with computers are good , but each in their own n@@ ich@@ e .
For example , we had a project to control de@@ v@@ i@@ c@@ es in public plac@@ es , in which we th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved on@@ es .
Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ent@@ s were not recorded by a c@@ am@@ er@@ a , but by a hand bracel@@ et that de@@ ter@@ m@@ in@@ ed the movement of b@@ on@@ es and m@@ us@@ c@@ l@@ es .
It 's big right now , but in the@@ or@@ y it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch .
In general , the future li@@ es in the m@@ i@@ x@@ ed control , e@@ .@@ g@@ . movement + voice .
- What do you mean ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bott@@ le of water ?
You will talk and show at the same time .
- U@@ su@@ ally I just say .
- Oh , that will be very hard to de@@ te@@ c@@ t .
- So you want to make the us@@ ers adap@@ t to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mut@@ ual appro@@ xim@@ ation .
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sen@@ s@@ ors that will enable more pre@@ c@@ ise determination of a person 's re@@ action .
This could be , e@@ .@@ g@@ . l@@ as@@ er sen@@ s@@ ors . They have a de@@ cent depth resolution , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with X@@ bo@@ x K@@ in@@ ec@@ t sen@@ s@@ ors , what are your com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ts about modern cameras ?
Not enough resolution , depth or something else ?
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on th@@ re@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ al recognition .
Of course , it would be good to have eight m@@ e@@ ga p@@ i@@ x@@ els with 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 k / s speed .
It 's not just the m@@ e@@ ga p@@ i@@ x@@ els , though , but the quality of the m@@ at@@ ri@@ x and the depth .
From the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m des@@ ign@@ ers .
So it 's important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z a@@ xis .
Speed , the number of images per second , is also very important .
Human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for g@@ e@@ st@@ u@@ res .
Steven B@@ a@@ th@@ ich@@ e from our Redmond laboratory created a touch sen@@ s@@ or with a regulated p@@ ro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ing d@@ el@@ ay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern s@@ er@@ ial sen@@ s@@ ors are closer to the latter indicator ( 6@@ 0-@@ 100 ) .
Not everyone un@@ der@@ stands how this aff@@ ec@@ ts the inter@@ action between man and machine .
In my work , it would be very useful to have a de@@ vice that does not re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e tou@@ ching and would have more images per second .
- Do@@ es the number of cameras need to be increased ?
- In K@@ in@@ ec@@ t there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an in@@ f@@ r@@ a@@ red em@@ it@@ ter and the second one , the re@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ ent of the si@@ gn@@ al .
The third one is actually a regular sen@@ s@@ or of visible range .
It is not app@@ li@@ ed to determine the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ t 's depth .
Po@@ ten@@ ti@@ ally , a large number of cameras could sol@@ v@@ e the problem ...
Or make it wor@@ se , by increasing the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red volume of c@@ al@@ c@@ ul@@ ations .
It would be nice to create a flexible an@@ alogue K@@ in@@ ec@@ t , play with the f@@ le@@ x@@ ion of c@@ am@@ er@@ a disp@@ os@@ it@@ i@@ on and see how this will help in th@@ re@@ e-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ al determination of the position .
- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its gl@@ as@@ s@@ es to the public , un@@ like G@@ oo@@ g@@ le .
D@@ on 't you think this is one of the most p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ing platforms from the point of view the everyday use of a@@ u@@ g@@ mented reality technologies ?
- C@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly it is not very con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent to walk around with a s@@ m@@ ar@@ t phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the co@@ ol@@ est option would be " trans@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al " a@@ u@@ g@@ mented reality , where you could sh@@ i@@ f@@ t from gl@@ as@@ s@@ es to s@@ m@@ ar@@ t phone , projection display , and e@@ very@@ where else based on a cloud platform .
Gl@@ as@@ s@@ es are a very per@@ s@@ on@@ al de@@ vice , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their w@@ e@@ ak@@ n@@ ess - a@@ u@@ g@@ mented reality based on gl@@ as@@ s@@ es will not al@@ low you to work on v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al objects together with other people .
- Let us im@@ ag@@ ine for a minute that man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ation of v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al h@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ ic objects in the air is available not only to Tony St@@ ar@@ k from I@@ r@@ on@@ man , but to a regular person .
There is one problem with this idea that the c@@ r@@ it@@ ics often point out : no t@@ ac@@ t@@ ile feedback !
Hands feel nothing !
What answers does your group pre@@ p@@ are to this challenge ?
- In my le@@ c@@ tu@@ res I often say that a@@ u@@ g@@ mented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the inter@@ action between man and machine .
I think that the eighth will probably be the addition of t@@ ac@@ t@@ ile sen@@ s@@ ations .
For now , one of the inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing tri@@ cks is to use the second hand as a sort of m@@ at@@ ri@@ x for the image .
It is great at re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er@@ ing p@@ ush@@ es !
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these " images in the air " a sense of tan@@ g@@ i@@ b@@ ility , for example , the inter@@ fer@@ ence of several targeted ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d r@@ a@@ ys in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sen@@ s@@ ation , but very w@@ e@@ ak right now , as if someone blew on your f@@ in@@ g@@ er@@ ti@@ p .
There are also w@@ r@@ ist bracel@@ ets that affect the ner@@ v@@ e en@@ d@@ ings in fingers , which is also a p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ing area .
- Ha@@ v@@ e you tried to de@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ e the mind ?
To force it to think that it fe@@ els something that it should be feeling when it se@@ es something ?
- This is a good idea and we haven 't tried this yet .
It conce@@ als one challenge that will not be sol@@ v@@ ed so quickly - how to force a person , who is physi@@ c@@ ally in a very limited sp@@ ace to believe that he is w@@ al@@ king along an open , almost li@@ mit@@ less sp@@ ace ; we are working on the conc@@ ep@@ t of tre@@ ad@@ m@@ ill@@ s ( not at all like in c@@ lu@@ bs ) , moving platforms , and g@@ i@@ ant bal@@ lo@@ on@@ s .
So far de@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ ving the mind has had limited success , there 's work for many years to come .
That 's what makes working on v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very be@@ g@@ innings .
J@@ ud@@ g@@ e@@ ment calls instead of culture - Ro@@ s@@ bal@@ t@@ .@@ r@@ u
Ro@@ s@@ b@@ al@@ t continues the project St. Petersburg A@@ v@@ ant-@@ garde , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the av@@ ant-@@ garde of culture and art .
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg , whose a@@ ch@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ em@@ ent@@ s reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , b@@ y@@ p@@ as@@ s@@ ing f@@ am@@ e in Russia .
The new player in Ro@@ s@@ b@@ al@@ t - the b@@ old artist Kir@@ ill Miller .
The whole city knows Kir@@ ill Miller , a be@@ ar@@ ded man d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ ed all in red , who can be seen by the R@@ us@@ si@@ an Museum , or by the S@@ um@@ m@@ er Garden , or at f@@ ash@@ i@@ on@@ able parties and shows .
Kir@@ ill Miller 's work always brings in crowds of people , no matter where they are e@@ x@@ h@@ ib@@ it@@ ed .
Kir@@ ill Miller is one of the pu@@ re@@ ly St. Petersburg social and ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ical st@@ or@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ers and c@@ re@@ at@@ ors of new m@@ y@@ th@@ ology .
Kir@@ ill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg av@@ ant-@@ garde of the late 80 's early 90 's .
Mo@@ re@@ over , he is a city man , who makes people smile on the stre@@ et and li@@ f@@ ts up everyone 's spirit .
Rec@@ ent@@ ly he took up the stre@@ et organ and became St. Petersburg 's music man , because he was read@@ y for this complex role with all his B@@ oh@@ em@@ ian e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence , philosophy and image .
- Kir@@ ill , why do you walk around the city all in red , not y@@ el@@ low or tur@@ qu@@ o@@ ise , for example ?
- I chose the col@@ our red as a fashion des@@ ig@@ ner engaged in look and image .
In this world , red is a com@@ promise between artist , im@@ age@@ -@@ maker and society .
Although in society , everything that is not g@@ re@@ y c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ es ag@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ si@@ on and ag@@ itation of the bad kind .
But my p@@ ro@@ voc@@ ations are aimed at starting con@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ation .
The whole history of my p@@ ro@@ voc@@ ative actions is an in@@ v@@ itation to discussion .
- When did you real@@ ise that you must be an artist ?
- At an exhibition in the Nev@@ sky House of Cul@@ t@@ ure , where my work was disp@@ l@@ ay@@ ed .
It became clear to me that this is my p@@ ath .
Th@@ en , the wave of older free , un@@ official ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s was gone , while new , free ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s like me were not understood .
I became friends with the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s of the new wave , with po@@ st@@ -@@ G@@ a@@ z@@ a@@ -@@ Nev@@ sky style ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s ( " po@@ st@@ -@@ g@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e@@ v@@ s@@ ch@@ in@@ a " ) , which led to P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and the wave was no longer .
I 'm drawn to the@@ at@@ re , c@@ lo@@ thing , music , all gen@@ res e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ t for lit@@ er@@ ature .
- And all this has been un@@ it@@ ed in your Ar@@ t@@ -@@ c@@ l@@ in@@ ic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
In 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 , I occupied the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y on P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ ay@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a B@@ oh@@ em@@ ian club , the h@@ ou@@ se of the St. Petersburg B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia .
Many were bor@@ n there : N@@ O@@ My , Te@@ qu@@ il@@ a Jazz , I remember when Sh@@ n@@ u@@ r was brought there with the Van Go@@ gh 's E@@ ar project .
Sh@@ n@@ u@@ r and his friends li@@ p s@@ an@@ g easy songs , wearing ti@@ g@@ h@@ t le@@ ot@@ ar@@ ds , and the now tr@@ en@@ d@@ y composer I@@ g@@ or V@@ do@@ v@@ in was with them .
When the group began to play live , it became Len@@ in@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ d .
T@@ r@@ a@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg was the pre@@ s@@ enter of many programs before H@@ al@@ i@@ -@@ Gal@@ i times .
We gave them T@@ r@@ a@@ k@@ h@@ ten@@ berg , and a great career was on its way , but the b@@ a@@ si@@ c education and m@@ ent@@ or@@ ing he received from us .
G@@ all@@ er@@ y D 13@@ 7 , G@@ ri@@ bo@@ ye@@ do@@ v club - all these e@@ ch@@ o the Ar@@ t@@ -@@ c@@ l@@ in@@ ic .
That is where our staff and regular customers left for .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something .
In 2000 , there was a poll in the press , for the People of Our City prize .
I was nominated Ar@@ t@@ ist of the Year , my cli@@ m@@ a@@ x came to an end .
In the new times , it is un@@ comfortable to work by old r@@ ul@@ es . I 'm a man of tr@@ ut@@ h , hon@@ e@@ st@@ y and culture of the last century .
In our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . You can be popular , but not very cultural .
- Y@@ our work is marked by a re@@ co@@ gn@@ iz@@ able style .
- Many of my works are hits , with clearly re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted rele@@ v@@ ance and ac@@ u@@ ity .
I will have a programme e@@ x@@ h@@ ib@@ it , " R@@ us@@ si@@ an museum in c@@ lo@@ w@@ n@@ s . "
C@@ lo@@ w@@ n@@ s are a tim@@ el@@ ess category .
I was social before , now it is painful and sc@@ ar@@ y to be like that .
But everything is b@@ l@@ ur@@ red in c@@ lo@@ w@@ n@@ s , tra@@ g@@ e@@ dy is removed .
I like gro@@ t@@ es@@ que , I have gro@@ t@@ es@@ que i@@ de@@ as .
For example , saving the world by to@@ tal@@ it@@ ar@@ ian ch@@ ang@@ ing of clothes by order .
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ay@@ s , people are j@@ ud@@ ged by appearance , not their in@@ ner qu@@ al@@ it@@ i@@ es .
Who knows , m@@ ay@@ be you cannot s@@ ha@@ k@@ e his hand , and need to sp@@ it in his face .
And the li@@ e will go away with the help of ch@@ ang@@ ing clothes .
- Rec@@ ent@@ ly we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a char@@ ac@@ ter .
Who fits the role better than I ?
- M@@ ay@@ be commercial art can also be beautiful ?
- N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ay@@ s , commercial art should be ne@@ at , con@@ si@@ der@@ ate , sweet .
There is a di@@ s@@ in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ation of c@@ ul@@ tu@@ res .
People used to get together in flo@@ cks , B@@ oh@@ em@@ i@@ ans liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
Now , e@@ very@@ body is di@@ vi@@ ded into m@@ i@@ c@@ r@@ o so@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ties , it 's hard to be liked by everyone .
I am not a hundred dollar bill to p@@ le@@ as@@ e all .
Now you have to think who you will p@@ le@@ as@@ e .
Now , each c@@ ul@@ t hero has 100 fans .
- But several th@@ ou@@ s@@ and come to St@@ as M@@ i@@ k@@ ha@@ il@@ o@@ v !
- The c@@ ast@@ -@@ outs go to see him , the se@@ x@@ u@@ al-@@ social sp@@ here is at work there .
But 300 people will come for culture , not 10,000 . In the end , there 's less management , money , everything dies out .
I have fans ; the main thing is not to be@@ tra@@ y them , not to sp@@ o@@ il what I have earned .
In my youth , I painted such art that one c@@ olle@@ c@@ tor had it hanging on the same w@@ all with F@@ al@@ k and Lar@@ i@@ on@@ o@@ v .
I started with paintings , which people usually end with .
Con@@ c@@ ep@@ ts are often m@@ i@@ x@@ ed up these days .
People say : sp@@ ir@@ it@@ u@@ al culture , consumer culture .
There is no culture in con@@ su@@ mer@@ ism , it 's " from another opera . "
I am a man of yesterday 's culture . I grew up on e@@ x@@ am@@ pl@@ es of ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s who lived poor and died in po@@ v@@ er@@ ty , refused money for the sa@@ k@@ e of p@@ ain@@ ting .
This is the culture I 'm for .
- Kir@@ ill , what is St. Petersburg missing ?
- Good cultural experts .
There is such a thing : an official for culture .
But not everyone can be engaged in culture .
Under the right r@@ ul@@ ers everything was different . K@@ ings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to st@@ ick with the right experts .
There are good con@@ su@@ l@@ t@@ an@@ ts in Moscow right now .
Here in St. Petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ly e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ate these experts and give way to them .
J@@ ud@@ g@@ e@@ ment calls are what thrive now .
Even E@@ r@@ art , but they 're different because they say hon@@ e@@ st@@ ly that we don 't accept all modern art . There are some ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s , who need to find other m@@ u@@ se@@ um@@ s for themselves .
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you ?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is be@@ dro@@ ck there .
It 's hard for art to grow on our ro@@ cks .
We need cultural be@@ dro@@ ck , but we now have more writers than readers . This is w@@ r@@ ong .
In Europe , there are many cur@@ ious people , who go to art e@@ x@@ h@@ ib@@ its , conc@@ er@@ ts .
Here , this l@@ ay@@ er is th@@ in .
We need to make art f@@ ash@@ i@@ on@@ able , as it was in the beginning of last century .
The project is su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted by the St. Petersburg grant .
G@@ i@@ v@@ e birth in sp@@ ace
The e@@ ar@@ th is in danger .
G@@ lo@@ b@@ al warming or an encounter with a k@@ ill@@ er ast@@ ero@@ id .
Car@@ av@@ ans of co@@ s@@ m@@ ic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement pl@@ an@@ et .
To save h@@ um@@ an@@ ity , the question is how to prop@@ ag@@ ate our race in conditions of w@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ n@@ ess or on that replacement pl@@ an@@ et ?
I think the choice is small .
There are only two actual pl@@ an@@ ets that can be explo@@ red even h@@ y@@ po@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
" V@@ en@@ us and Mars , " says Senior R@@ es@@ e@@ ar@@ cher of the P@@ .@@ K@@ . Sh@@ ter@@ n@@ berg State A@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ m@@ y Institute ( G@@ A@@ I@@ S@@ h ) Vladimir Sur@@ d@@ in .
But while conditions on Mars are more appro@@ pri@@ ate for life , V@@ en@@ us has 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ degree te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res .
Li@@ f@@ e is possible only at a high al@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de or on the or@@ bit of V@@ en@@ us ... in sp@@ ace .
The question of re@@ production in sp@@ ace began with f@@ l@@ or@@ a .
Half a century ago , e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ s were run on plants .
Four gen@@ er@@ ations of pe@@ as gro@@ w@@ n in or@@ bit were no different from their e@@ ar@@ th counter@@ parts .
Th@@ en , in@@ se@@ c@@ ts were b@@ red in or@@ bit , small f@@ ru@@ it fli@@ es .
In 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 9 , qu@@ a@@ il eg@@ g@@ s were sent to sp@@ ace , to ch@@ ec@@ k how an em@@ b@@ r@@ y@@ o de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ s in w@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ n@@ ess .
We get an absolutely n@@ or@@ m@@ al ch@@ ick .
But then the problem begins .
" The problem is related to the fact that this ch@@ ick ne@@ e@@ ds to find support , ne@@ e@@ ds to get on its feet and start moving , " explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Bi@@ ological Pro@@ ble@@ ms ( I@@ M@@ B@@ P ) R@@ A@@ N Vladimir Sy@@ ch@@ e@@ v .
H@@ av@@ ing found no support , ch@@ icks were tumbling around in di@@ s@@ order .
After 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ n@@ s e@@ x@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed complete at@@ ro@@ ph@@ y of in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts .
Ch@@ i@@ c@@ ks did not re@@ act to light and sound .
And the problem was that they simply died after four days .
" We b@@ red ch@@ icks twice there , and then st@@ op@@ p@@ ed , because it is im@@ possible to work with them there , " says Vladimir Sy@@ ch@@ e@@ v , con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ing the failure of the e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent with ch@@ icks in sp@@ ace .
The last b@@ i@@ ological " m@@ in@@ i@@ -@@ ar@@ k " with animals f@@ le@@ w into or@@ bit 16 years ago .
In sp@@ r@@ ing 20@@ 13 , e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ s will continue .
However , only s@@ am@@ e-@@ se@@ x beings will be on the B@@ ion b@@ i@@ o-@@ s@@ at@@ ell@@ it@@ e .
There was an e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent with r@@ at@@ s , who were sent to sp@@ ace with fo@@ e@@ t@@ us .
In p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le , there was nothing e@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ y there .
" This was on b@@ i@@ o-@@ s@@ at@@ ell@@ it@@ es , but again , it was a s@@ in@@ g@@ ul@@ ar e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent and such research ne@@ e@@ ds to be conducted , " says Vladimir Sy@@ ch@@ e@@ v .
After landing , the co@@ s@@ m@@ ic r@@ at@@ s had babies .
But it 's hard to sol@@ v@@ e the problem of re@@ production directly in sp@@ ace .
It 's not an easy t@@ ask .
An@@ im@@ als simply cannot follow their se@@ x@@ ual instinct , when they 're out of their fam@@ ili@@ ar environment .
In p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le , people , un@@ like animals , can .
H@@ o@@ m@@ o sa@@ p@@ i@@ ens have ab@@ str@@ act thinking , and are able to create a f@@ itting emo@@ tional background .
Such e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ s are not conducted for ethical re@@ as@@ on@@ s .
But women have been flying to sp@@ ace for 50 years .
The biggest risk was for T@@ er@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ a .
The most v@@ al@@ u@@ able thing for h@@ um@@ an@@ ity is the female body .
Our " S@@ e@@ ag@@ ull " left and n@@ o@@ body on e@@ ar@@ th could tell whether she would be OK after flying to sp@@ ace .
W@@ h@@ e@@ th@@ er she will be able to give birth after this flight .
" Nobody answered this question , " says ro@@ cket and sp@@ ace industry veteran , V@@ ak@@ ht@@ an@@ g V@@ a@@ ch@@ n@@ ad@@ ze .
In June 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 4 , only a year after flying to sp@@ ace , the first woman in sp@@ ace V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ a T@@ er@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ a gave birth to a daughter .
The child 's father , An@@ dri@@ an N@@ i@@ k@@ ol@@ a@@ e@@ v , was also a co@@ s@@ m@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ t .
In 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 8 , the second woman co@@ s@@ m@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ t , S@@ v@@ e@@ t@@ l@@ an@@ a S@@ av@@ it@@ skaya , who went into or@@ bit twice and even worked in open sp@@ ace , gave birth to a son .
However , the risk remains .
We have few , very few co@@ s@@ m@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ ts , who were OK and had h@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y children after long fli@@ gh@@ ts .
" What 's more , it is dangerous even for or@@ b@@ it@@ al fli@@ gh@@ ts , " adds pilot and co@@ s@@ m@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ t , H@@ er@@ o of the US@@ S@@ R , H@@ er@@ o of Russia , V@@ al@@ er@@ y Po@@ li@@ ak@@ o@@ v .
And yet , h@@ um@@ an@@ ity ne@@ e@@ ds to seek out some new av@@ en@@ ues in bio@@ technologies , protection from r@@ a@@ di@@ ation , c@@ re@@ ation of ar@@ ti@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ al g@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ ity .

If for ad@@ ul@@ ts water is a foreign medi@@ um , although comfortable , for in@@ f@@ an@@ ts it is a native el@@ em@@ ent .
Sm@@ all am@@ p@@ h@@ ib@@ i@@ ans seem to con@@ firm that life came to land from the ocean .
There is a connection with the fact that an in@@ f@@ ant sp@@ ends about 9 months in am@@ ni@@ o@@ tic f@@ lu@@ id in the w@@ o@@ m@@ b ; it is e@@ a@@ si@@ er to get used to water after that .
In p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le , it is lo@@ g@@ ical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first b@@ a@@ thing .
" This is very little time to f@@ or@@ get something , " says in@@ f@@ ant s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing in@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tor Mar@@ in@@ a Ak@@ sen@@ o@@ v@@ a .
In other words , if for a new@@ bor@@ n w@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ n@@ ess is more natural , a woman ne@@ e@@ ds g@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ ity , e@@ ar@@ th 's pull .
St@@ o@@ m@@ a@@ ch and p@@ el@@ vi@@ c m@@ us@@ c@@ l@@ es usually quickly de@@ gen@@ er@@ ate in w@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ n@@ ess ; the ability to p@@ ush out the em@@ b@@ r@@ y@@ o is reduced .
Well , let 's assume that chil@@ d@@ birth stimul@@ at@@ ors will work out .

" Th@@ en what ? " - as@@ ks V@@ al@@ er@@ y Po@@ li@@ ak@@ o@@ v about this n@@ on-@@ tri@@ vi@@ al issue .
On the other hand , a b@@ ab@@ y also ne@@ e@@ ds ar@@ ti@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ al g@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ ity .
When a body does not feel the e@@ ar@@ th 's pull , it does not form the sk@@ el@@ e@@ t@@ al and m@@ us@@ c@@ ul@@ ar system .
It is not possible to dress a new@@ bor@@ n in or@@ bit into a special lo@@ ad@@ ing su@@ it for training , as they do with ad@@ ul@@ ts .
He will simply not have what he ne@@ e@@ ds to survive .
" And this e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a h@@ an@@ di@@ c@@ apped , com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely un@@ adapted human to e@@ ar@@ th , " pre@@ di@@ c@@ ts Chairman of the Committee on Bi@@ o@@ e@@ th@@ ics I@@ M@@ B@@ P R@@ A@@ N I@@ g@@ or P@@ e@@ st@@ o@@ v .
For the moment , birth of children in sp@@ ace is just a the@@ or@@ y .
However , with time , it will become reality , when earth@@ l@@ ings will go to a far@@ away pl@@ an@@ et in their ships , and it will become the home for their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing , who were bor@@ n in sp@@ ace .
N@@ K@@ U H@@ e@@ ad : S@@ v@@ ar@@ c Sy@@ st@@ e@@ m a@@ u@@ dit has failed because of p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans .
The C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public con@@ tr@@ acts , but it l@@ ags behind in their app@@ lic@@ ation .
This was said by M@@ il@@ os@@ la@@ v Kal@@ a , vice-president of the Supreme Au@@ dit Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an interview for Ak@@ tu@@ al@@ ne@@ .@@ c@@ z .
" The Law will never be per@@ f@@ ec@@ t , but its app@@ lic@@ ation should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , " states Kal@@ a , com@@ m@@ ent@@ ing on the current situation .
S@@ im@@ il@@ ar conc@@ lu@@ sions are also re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed by the joint a@@ u@@ dit from the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch and German a@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ ors .
As an example of im@@ p@@ ro@@ per practice , they c@@ it@@ e P@@ e@@ t@@ r N@@ ec@@ as 's approach to the so@@ -@@ called " S@@ v@@ ar@@ c Sy@@ st@@ e@@ m . "
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ D@@ S will not be bur@@ den@@ ing business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed ?
" The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it p@@ ro@@ h@@ ib@@ its something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ ut@@ y-@@ bo@@ un@@ d to m@@ on@@ itor and en@@ force , " as@@ s@@ er@@ ts Kal@@ a .
At the a@@ u@@ dit com@@ mit@@ tee 's session in the House of De@@ pu@@ ties , you spoke about a joint project between the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public and Germany , within which legislation re@@ lat@@ ing to public con@@ tr@@ acts in both countries was compared .
What exactly was this about ?
This is about par@@ al@@ le@@ l a@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ ing , which we began around two years ago .
S@@ im@@ p@@ ly put , this is about how European legislation go@@ v@@ er@@ n@@ s the h@@ an@@ d@@ ling of public con@@ tr@@ acts , fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed by in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al state le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ l@@ ations and then the actual practice itself .
We brought all this together , and although the a@@ u@@ dit is not yet complete , some very inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even " more conc@@ ise and complete , " however the actual practice is in certain as@@ p@@ ec@@ ts better in Germany .
This con@@ f@@ ir@@ ms that creating more and more conc@@ ise r@@ ul@@ es is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual app@@ lic@@ ation of these la@@ ws .
What does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
This kind of joint a@@ u@@ dit could contribute to cur@@ ta@@ iling these efforts to spec@@ i@@ f@@ y our law , to reduce and per@@ f@@ ec@@ t bo@@ und@@ ar@@ ies , when it does not have such a po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e impact .
E@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ y m@@ e@@ ans ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that p@@ ro@@ f@@ it@@ e@@ er@@ ing and possible criminal p@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ ings may be avo@@ i@@ ded .
However , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be p@@ ro@@ c@@ ured .
The system might become over@@ loaded with the amount of p@@ a@@ p@@ er@@ work , and those , who wish to look for lo@@ op@@ holes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
These are domestic problems about the p@@ r@@ ac@@ tic@@ al im@@ p@@ le@@ m@@ ent@@ ation of legislation re@@ lat@@ ing to public con@@ tr@@ acts .
How does the a@@ u@@ dit system work in Germany ?
Is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or is it or@@ g@@ an@@ ised di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ent@@ ly ?
As far as the office is conc@@ ern@@ ed , the B@@ un@@ des@@ re@@ ch@@ n@@ ung@@ sh@@ of f@@ un@@ c@@ tions like our N@@ K@@ U , and it is or@@ g@@ an@@ ised like ours , it also has a com@@ mit@@ tee although it is a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ ted slightly di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ent@@ ly , but basically both offices op@@ er@@ ate similarly .
Po@@ wers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is or@@ g@@ an@@ ised fe@@ der@@ ally , so these courts of a@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ ors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly di@@ f@@ f@@ ers from our own .
The B@@ R@@ H can only a@@ u@@ dit federal money , known to us as state funds .
Public funds , which , for us , are ad@@ m@@ in@@ i@@ st@@ ered by regional and municipal authorities , are audited by the federal courts of a@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ ors there .
When it comes to their legislation , is it more stra@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ forward than ours ?
O@@ v@@ er@@ all , I would not like to make a com@@ par@@ i@@ s@@ on without any specific data , ne@@ v@@ er@@ th@@ el@@ ess in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every as@@ p@@ ec@@ t .
Is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ?
That is certainly not tru@@ e , but again , I pre@@ fer not to make such com@@ par@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ s .
It should be said that even in a country we per@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ e as e@@ x@@ em@@ pl@@ ar@@ y , they encounter a whole range of problems .
If that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
Com@@ ing back to domestic legislation , what did the am@@ en@@ d@@ ment to public con@@ tr@@ acts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ?
The period since the am@@ en@@ d@@ ment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifest@@ ed itself in our a@@ u@@ dit work yet .
Since we carry out our a@@ u@@ dits e@@ x@@ -@@ post , a certain d@@ el@@ ay has to be taken into account .
As yet , we have only observed it within the process of pre@@ par@@ ing future a@@ u@@ dits - we have launched our new " fiscal failure risk de@@ te@@ ction " system , with which we have p@@ ro@@ c@@ essed almost 14 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and public con@@ tr@@ acts , and these have been an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ ed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjust@@ ed conditions governing certain types of selection p@@ ro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ es , and so on .
So do you see the ad@@ option of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c system ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed .
A problem , which may ar@@ ise here , is that the law becomes " too con@@ stra@@ in@@ ed " and will not be en@@ f@@ or@@ ce@@ able .
Under the previous r@@ ul@@ es , parties being audited were already bo@@ un@@ d by their a@@ u@@ dit provider ( for example , in the case of regional op@@ er@@ ational p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es , the regional office ) to the fact that every infringement of public con@@ tr@@ acts law m@@ e@@ ans a bre@@ a@@ ch of b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y di@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ ine .
Is it worth con@@ stra@@ in@@ ing the law in this way , in that case ?
I do not think this is the way .
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not p@@ en@@ al@@ ise those , who make a m@@ i@@ st@@ ak@@ e on a te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ ality , which does not affect the final decision .
This kind of system will only increase pressure on b@@ u@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ cr@@ acy .
So how can we get out of this ?
Let 's see where this de@@ ad@@ -@@ end takes us .
The Prime Minister recently said the O@@ D@@ S will not be bur@@ den@@ ing b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ men with a@@ u@@ dits of the so@@ -@@ called " S@@ v@@ ar@@ c Sy@@ st@@ e@@ m " - what does this mean ?
Is the S@@ v@@ ar@@ c Sy@@ st@@ e@@ m p@@ ro@@ h@@ ib@@ it@@ ed or allowed ?
The Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it p@@ ro@@ h@@ ib@@ its something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ ut@@ y-@@ bo@@ un@@ d to m@@ on@@ itor and en@@ force .
He may say : " Let us change this law and re@@ la@@ x it , " but he cannot say we should pre@@ tend it is not there .
The law on public con@@ tr@@ acts has relatively stri@@ c@@ t r@@ ul@@ es about the f@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ it@@ i@@ es which must be ad@@ her@@ ed to - which is the right way to ensure public ten@@ der@@ s are p@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ ted .
On the other hand , it is a tra@@ g@@ e@@ dy , when a b@@ id@@ der with the best offer is e@@ x@@ c@@ lu@@ ded on a te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ ality .
The Law will never be per@@ f@@ ec@@ t , but its app@@ lic@@ ation should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
Ro@@ ads are i@@ c@@ y in plac@@ es , but mostly pass@@ able .
In several plac@@ es in the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public , the main roads are i@@ c@@ y and s@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ y .
However , the majority of roads are pass@@ able , with e@@ x@@ tra care needed in plac@@ es .
Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad region
In the Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad region , the roads have been us@@ able this morning , though in some plac@@ es they were i@@ c@@ y and s@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ y .
The te@@ m@@ per@@ ature has dropped to between five and ten de@@ g@@ re@@ es below zer@@ o , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day .
S@@ n@@ o@@ wing in the region has st@@ op@@ p@@ ed , and only a th@@ in l@@ ay@@ er of snow remains in the lo@@ w@@ lands .
However , the ri@@ d@@ g@@ es of the Kr@@ us@@ n@@ e Mountains have around 30 c@@ en@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ res of snow .
In some locations there is limited v@@ i@@ s@@ ib@@ ility due to m@@ ist , according to the local high@@ way service .
The R@@ 6 high@@ -@@ speed motor@@ way and primary roads in the region are now us@@ able without re@@ stri@@ ction .
C@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on is , of course , appro@@ pri@@ ate , for example , on certain bri@@ d@@ g@@ es , where the surface can be i@@ c@@ y and sli@@ p@@ per@@ y .
All se@@ con@@ d@@ ar@@ y and ter@@ ti@@ ar@@ y roads are also pass@@ able , including mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in roads .
In certain stre@@ t@@ ches of these roads there might be remaining f@@ ro@@ zen and com@@ p@@ acted snow patches .
A@@ bo@@ v@@ e all , at higher levels , e@@ x@@ tra care should be taken while driving .
P@@ ar@@ du@@ b@@ i@@ c@@ e and H@@ r@@ a@@ de@@ c Kr@@ al@@ o@@ v@@ e region
On some roads in E@@ ast@@ er@@ n B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia , there might be a risk of black i@@ c@@ e , at higher al@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ des and in the mountains there might be a l@@ ay@@ er of com@@ p@@ acted snow , according to the Road and Mo@@ t@@ or@@ way Di@@ rec@@ torate .
The high@@ way service is warning the drivers against black i@@ c@@ e , which might o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r at higher al@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ des of the P@@ ar@@ du@@ b@@ i@@ c@@ e region in partic@@ ul@@ ar .
Black i@@ c@@ e may o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r around Lan@@ sk@@ rou@@ n , U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad Or@@ lic@@ i , Po@@ li@@ cky , S@@ vit@@ av@@ y , and V@@ y@@ so@@ k@@ e M@@ y@@ to , and particularly on se@@ con@@ d@@ ar@@ y and ter@@ ti@@ ar@@ y roads .
The I / 4@@ 3 and I / 3@@ 4 roads have been ch@@ em@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ av@@ y .
Snow is particularly aff@@ ec@@ ting the roads in the Kr@@ k@@ on@@ o@@ se and Or@@ li@@ ck@@ e mountains .
At higher al@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ des , there is a com@@ p@@ acted snow l@@ ay@@ er on the roads around R@@ y@@ ch@@ n@@ o@@ v n@@ ad K@@ ne@@ z@@ n@@ o@@ u and Tr@@ ut@@ n@@ o@@ v .
In E@@ ast@@ er@@ n B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia the day will be mostly clear to partly clou@@ dy , and d@@ r@@ y .
T@@ em@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res will be between minus three and plus one degree C@@ el@@ si@@ us mostly , with a light w@@ ind .
P@@ il@@ sen region
The roads in the P@@ il@@ sen region have been us@@ able this morning , with e@@ x@@ tra care needed in some plac@@ es . D@@ ri@@ v@@ er@@ s should take the weather conditions into account .
The morning will be f@@ ro@@ st@@ y , with te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res r@@ an@@ ging between three and nine de@@ g@@ re@@ es below zer@@ o .
D@@ ue to the e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ing snow and sub@@ sequ@@ ent drop in te@@ m@@ per@@ ature , certain roads may be i@@ c@@ y .
D@@ ri@@ v@@ er@@ s should expect m@@ ist in plac@@ es , though v@@ i@@ s@@ ib@@ ility will g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ ally improve .
This information was reported by the region 's high@@ way service .
The D@@ 5 motor@@ way is dri@@ vable almost without re@@ stri@@ ction , but the road services re@@ commend e@@ x@@ tra c@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on between the 80@@ th and 13@@ 1@@ s@@ t k@@ il@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ re m@@ ar@@ k@@ s .
Most primary road s@@ ur@@ faces are d@@ r@@ y and f@@ ro@@ st@@ -@@ free .
Southern areas of the P@@ il@@ sen and T@@ a@@ ch@@ o@@ v regions may have i@@ c@@ y patches .
S@@ e@@ con@@ d@@ ar@@ y and ter@@ ti@@ ar@@ y roads are w@@ e@@ t , and may therefore also have i@@ c@@ y patches .
D@@ ri@@ v@@ er@@ s should be cautious especially on less fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ed roads in the B@@ oh@@ em@@ ian Fo@@ rest .
O@@ l@@ o@@ m@@ ou@@ c region
D@@ ri@@ v@@ er@@ s should expect snow sl@@ ush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the O@@ l@@ o@@ m@@ ou@@ c region .
It is a result of the ch@@ em@@ ical treatment carried out at C@@ er@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ k@@ se se@@ d@@ l@@ o and on the way to V@@ id@@ el@@ sky K@@ ri@@ z .
S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s were brought out by f@@ all@@ ing snow overnight , the S@@ um@@ per@@ k region , according to high@@ way m@@ a@@ in@@ ten@@ ance , got around three c@@ en@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ res of snow .
In other parts of the region , roads are mainly pass@@ able without restrictions .
" In the S@@ um@@ per@@ k region , trac@@ es of snow have remained at the highest al@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ des .
D@@ ri@@ v@@ er@@ s should expect snow sl@@ ush at C@@ er@@ ven@@ oh@@ or@@ s@@ k@@ e se@@ d@@ l@@ o in the direction of J@@ es@@ en@@ ik , " the disp@@ at@@ ch officer for the S@@ um@@ per@@ k high@@ way service told CT@@ K today .
Their J@@ es@@ en@@ ik counter@@ parts also made an ou@@ ting overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest al@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ des are now clear and w@@ e@@ t following the ch@@ em@@ ical treatment , according to them .
The O@@ l@@ o@@ m@@ ou@@ c region 's roads are us@@ able without re@@ stri@@ ction , while in the area of S@@ ter@@ n@@ b@@ er@@ k drivers should be@@ w@@ are in w@@ oo@@ ded areas , where roads have remained w@@ e@@ t .
U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region , Li@@ b@@ er@@ e@@ c region
Since this morning , the s@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ s have reported several plac@@ es , which are difficult to pass in northern B@@ oh@@ em@@ ia .
B@@ es@@ ides certain s@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ -@@ co@@ v@@ er@@ ed plac@@ es , or some i@@ c@@ y f@@ ro@@ s@@ t patches , the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in road from T@@ el@@ nice to K@@ n@@ in@@ i@@ c@@ e in the U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m region is also closed , according to the police database .
T@@ em@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res remain below zer@@ o and roads are likely to remain s@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ y and i@@ c@@ y . In the lo@@ w@@ lands , however , particularly sou@@ the@@ ast of the Centr@@ al B@@ oh@@ em@@ ian U@@ pl@@ an@@ d@@ s , there are no problems and roads are mostly d@@ r@@ y .
No traffic h@@ ol@@ d@@ -@@ u@@ p@@ s have so far been reported .
I@@ cy f@@ ro@@ s@@ t patches have been reported in partic@@ ul@@ ar by road m@@ a@@ in@@ ten@@ ance around S@@ te@@ ti .
According to m@@ e@@ te@@ or@@ ologists the conditions for this were per@@ f@@ ec@@ t - r@@ a@@ in and mel@@ ting snow during the day , with a clear night and fre@@ e@@ z@@ ing te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res .
Ad@@ verse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ st@@ i n@@ ad La@@ be@@ m and Li@@ b@@ er@@ e@@ c regions .
The c@@ lo@@ s@@ ure of the T@@ el@@ nice to K@@ n@@ in@@ i@@ c@@ e road was caused by b@@ ent tre@@ e b@@ r@@ an@@ ches , which were w@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ ed down to road level by s@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ fall .
S@@ im@@ on Or@@ n@@ est : At the conc@@ er@@ ts we want a f@@ u@@ si@@ on of po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ?
It is just another star@@ t@@ ler , which we like to lat@@ ch on to .
Together with The T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p b@@ and , we tend to jo@@ k@@ e about it , saying that we might be the only b@@ and on e@@ ar@@ th that could draw enough po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e energy to hold off or aver@@ t the end of the world com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely .
In December you are even or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ing a uni@@ que series of three conc@@ er@@ ts against the end of the world .
C@@ an you give our readers some details on this ?
This is a nationwide f@@ und@@ -@@ raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years .
We decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the M@@ ay@@ an c@@ al@@ en@@ d@@ ar , due on the 2@@ 1@@ s@@ t of December at 11 : 10 a.@@ m .
On the e@@ v@@ e , the 20@@ th of December , at 9@@ p@@ m , 3 conc@@ er@@ ts will take place in par@@ al@@ le@@ l in Prague , B@@ r@@ no , and O@@ stra@@ v@@ a .
They will end at around the time when Ki@@ ri@@ b@@ at@@ i Island in the Pac@@ i@@ fi@@ c , which is 12 hours ahead of us , re@@ a@@ ch@@ es the end of the M@@ ay@@ an c@@ al@@ en@@ d@@ ar .
Who came up with this idea ?
In@@ it@@ i@@ ally it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our des@@ ig@@ ner , H@@ on@@ z@@ a Au@@ g@@ u@@ st@@ a .
A@@ part from the fact that we want to c@@ olle@@ c@@ t enough po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to al@@ low ourselves and the public to sp@@ are some th@@ ou@@ gh@@ ts for the state of our pl@@ an@@ et , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
On the o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on of the end of the M@@ ay@@ an c@@ al@@ en@@ d@@ ar , we have also pre@@ p@@ a@@ red a range of uni@@ que items , shoes , t@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts , b@@ ags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be pur@@ ch@@ ased at www.@@ e-@@ t@@ a@@ p@@ .@@ c@@ z to support our cause .
The T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p b@@ and , together with other ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s , also recorded the so@@ -@@ called an@@ them against the end of the world , called " The En@@ d of the World is c@@ anc@@ elled . "
It is already well received on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , will it figure at the f@@ und@@ -@@ raising conc@@ er@@ ts ?
Of course , for the grand fin@@ al@@ e , as long as the world does not end be@@ fore@@ hand .
It will be s@@ un@@ g by all the ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s at all the three conc@@ er@@ ts at the same time .
The an@@ them will also be fe@@ at@@ ured in a uni@@ que live bro@@ ad@@ cast on C@@ z@@ e@@ ch T@@ el@@ e@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ ion .
The words were w@@ r@@ it@@ ten and the role of J@@ es@@ us in the video cli@@ p was played by T@@ o@@ m@@ as H@@ an@@ ak , X@@ in@@ d@@ l X also s@@ ings in it ...
How did you end up working with them ?
We c@@ ol@@ l@@ abor@@ ate also with other per@@ s@@ on@@ al@@ it@@ i@@ es of the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch cultural scene , due to or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ing a lot of f@@ und@@ -@@ raising events and conc@@ er@@ ts ...
We try to really get them involved in these projects .
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us .
What will the proceeds from the conc@@ er@@ t against the end of the world go to ?
E@@ qu@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ing the whe@@ el@@ ch@@ a@@ ir@@ -@@ ac@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ble e@@ du@@ c@@ ational St@@ u@@ de@@ o centre , which is already in its sixth year , in c@@ ol@@ l@@ abor@@ ation with the citizens association T@@ a@@ p from the J@@ e@@ d@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute for the di@@ s@@ ab@@ led .
T@@ ut@@ ors come in regularly to spend time with the J@@ e@@ d@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute 's students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them .
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford t@@ ut@@ ors , so we try to provide this for them in this way .
Wi@@ th@@ in the con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction project at the J@@ e@@ d@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project .
Every conc@@ er@@ t se@@ es the appearance of several bands and ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s .
How do you select them ?
We have tried to com@@ p@@ ile a programme , which sp@@ e@@ ak@@ s for all ag@@ es , including children .
For example , in Prague , Ch@@ in@@ as@@ ki , Sup@@ p@@ or@@ t L@@ es@@ b@@ i@@ ens , I@@ l@@ lu@@ str@@ at@@ o@@ sp@@ here with D@@ an Bar@@ t@@ a , The T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p , Mar@@ ian B@@ ang@@ o and J@@ ir@@ i Su@@ ch@@ y will appear .
Further details can be found at www.@@ k@@ p@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ c@@ z .
Are you planning any more " b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ast@@ ic events " in the future ?
In May , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Sp@@ r@@ ing , so we will de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely be pre@@ par@@ ing a good l@@ in@@ e-@@ up with some inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing g@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ s .
N@@ e@@ x@@ t year , we would like to play at the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago .
Y@@ our international plans are not mo@@ dest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Mad@@ ri@@ d , Brussels , London , and Moscow .
The T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p is n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess a b@@ and composed of h@@ an@@ di@@ c@@ apped people .
How do you cop@@ e with these jo@@ ur@@ neys in terms of lo@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ ics and or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation ?
It is not as sc@@ ar@@ y as it might seem at first .
We have five members in electric whe@@ el@@ ch@@ a@@ ir@@ s , which must be tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ ted in the lu@@ g@@ g@@ age area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of lu@@ g@@ g@@ age and in@@ st@@ ru@@ ment cases ...
Ne@@ v@@ er@@ th@@ el@@ ess , we have so far managed it without any problems , CS@@ A and British A@@ ir@@ ways were well pre@@ p@@ a@@ red for us , so much so that , on o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on , I was quite surprised .
Even in Moscow , which we have just re@@ turned from , it all went s@@ m@@ oo@@ th@@ ly .
Th@@ an@@ ks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to com@@ p@@ are specific ac@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ b@@ ility issues , public attitudes to di@@ s@@ ability and so on .
What have been your e@@ x@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ ces so far ?
After Mad@@ ri@@ d , L@@ u@@ x@@ em@@ bo@@ ur@@ g , London and other plac@@ es , where everything f@@ un@@ c@@ tions better than here , we have just w@@ it@@ n@@ essed that in the East everything is still in its be@@ g@@ innings .
Com@@ p@@ a@@ red to Prague , Moscow is rather in@@ ac@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ble ; it still remains un@@ usual there for a person in an electric whe@@ el@@ chair to be tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ing around the city centre on his or her own .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ou@@ s things , such as giving whe@@ el@@ ch@@ a@@ ir@@ s priority in li@@ f@@ ts , are not com@@ m@@ on@@ place there .
For@@ t@@ un@@ ately , citizens associations are em@@ er@@ g@@ ing there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with di@@ s@@ ab@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ es .
And on the other hand , where do we still la@@ g behind more advanced countries ?
There are a lot of things , which we still la@@ g behind on ...
It is important to men@@ ti@@ on that improvements to the current situation always de@@ p@@ end on the efforts of the people who are affected .
In London and Mad@@ ri@@ d it is com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely natural for people with serious h@@ an@@ di@@ c@@ a@@ p@@ s to be in@@ de@@ p@@ en@@ d@@ ent@@ ly out in public , and they can use the to@@ il@@ ets , go to the museum , or w@@ h@@ er@@ ever ...
It is less common there for large groups of people with di@@ s@@ ab@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ es to ac@@ tiv@@ ely take part in social life , in this respect with The T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p we are a step ahead !
Public respect or ac@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ b@@ ility is one thing , but it is only when we can become fam@@ ou@@ s a@@ th@@ le@@ t@@ es , ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s , actors , p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
So far there are only e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ tional cases , people who are str@@ ong-@@ w@@ ill@@ ed .
The T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p b@@ and is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what p@@ ro@@ mp@@ ted you in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 to form it ?
I began my job as a t@@ ut@@ or at the J@@ e@@ d@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute , where I was s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
Since I am a m@@ u@@ si@@ cian myself - among others I play the sa@@ x@@ op@@ h@@ one - I started a music club with a c@@ olle@@ ag@@ ue .
With time , as our mo@@ der@@ ator Lad@@ y@@ a An@@ g@@ el@@ o@@ vi@@ c says , it has gro@@ w@@ n a little out of our control ( l@@ a@@ u@@ gh ) .
Y@@ our popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am I m@@ i@@ st@@ ak@@ en ?
It is tru@@ e that we have been helped by creating ties to fam@@ ou@@ s s@@ in@@ g@@ ers and also by our proactive work on promoting the b@@ and .
We re@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed that work , which go@@ es on un@@ seen can be like it never e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ed .
Th@@ an@@ ks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality t@@ ut@@ ors , equipment and so on .
Was it your goal to take The T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p to such h@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ ts ?
From the out@@ set , I felt there was potential to do things a little di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ent@@ ly .
Show business is filled with things , where one im@@ it@@ at@@ es the other .
It is lo@@ g@@ ical in its own way ; all new things are taken in h@@ es@@ it@@ an@@ t@@ ly and take a long time .
Th@@ ings , which are uni@@ que , are few and far between , but I would d@@ are to claim that T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p is one of those things .
A person 's first im@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on on seeing you is , of course , p@@ ity - it is a natural re@@ action ...
But that p@@ ity is simply w@@ ast@@ ed , because h@@ an@@ di@@ c@@ apped people are not ab@@ an@@ d@@ on@@ ed and su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing beings , who need to be p@@ it@@ i@@ ed .
They are people , who can fully live life and b@@ lo@@ s@@ so@@ m , as@@ su@@ m@@ ing , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
I say that when a person with a h@@ an@@ di@@ c@@ a@@ p su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ ds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are suggesting ?
If we want to achieve top class work , we must be un@@ com@@ p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ing in many things and re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e a certain level of di@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ ine .
I think this is to be expected .
Some people come to us with a ro@@ man@@ tic idea and their head in the clouds , and when they find out they have to go to re@@ h@@ e@@ ar@@ s@@ als twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ing to conc@@ er@@ ts , their enthusiasm quickly disap@@ pe@@ ars .
That is how it works e@@ very@@ where , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .
The T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p b@@ and currently has tw@@ enty members .
How many of those were present at the beginning in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8 ?
Only one , Lad@@ y@@ a An@@ g@@ el@@ o@@ vi@@ c .
We are an open group , people come and people go , this is un@@ avo@@ id@@ able .
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our do@@ or open .
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.@@ 1@@ 2.@@ 2012 from 9@@ p@@ m .
The ven@@ ues will be Pra@@ ha In@@ ch@@ e@@ b@@ a , B@@ r@@ no F@@ le@@ d@@ a , and O@@ stra@@ v@@ a P@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ o@@ j@@ e@@ m with performances from 12 bands and other m@@ u@@ si@@ cians from the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public .
All three cities will be joined by a tel@@ e@@ v@@ ised l@@ in@@ k-@@ up at the evening 's close for a un@@ it@@ ed rendition of The T@@ a@@ p T@@ a@@ p 's an@@ them " The En@@ d of the World is c@@ anc@@ elled "
The conc@@ er@@ t 's goal is to raise funds to e@@ qu@@ i@@ p the ST@@ U@@ D@@ E@@ O mul@@ ti@@ -@@ functional whe@@ el@@ -@@ chair ac@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ble le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing centre at the J@@ e@@ d@@ li@@ ck@@ a Institute in Prague in the su@@ m of 25 million C@@ z@@ e@@ ch c@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ s .

Poland and the C@@ o@@ s@@ mo@@ s .
Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency ad@@ mit@@ ted Poland as the tw@@ en@@ ti@@ e@@ t@@ h member of the agency , being the second nation from the former E@@ ast@@ er@@ n B@@ lo@@ ck ( after the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public , which became a fully f@@ le@@ d@@ ged member of the E@@ S@@ A on the 1@@ 2@@ th of November 2008 ) .
Poland began close cooperation with the E@@ S@@ A in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 , and in the following years it has parti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ated in a series of agency projects .
Of course , Poland 's p@@ ath to the sp@@ ace had begun much earlier .
Pol@@ ish b@@ off@@ ins de@@ vo@@ ted their time to sp@@ ace flight even before the S@@ e@@ con@@ d World W@@ ar , but were not always met with understanding .
I look back , for instance , to the le@@ c@@ t@@ ure of A S@@ ter@@ n@@ fel@@ d in Warsaw 's a@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ m@@ y ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ at@@ or@@ y , who , on the 6@@ th of December 1@@ 9@@ 33 , presented i@@ de@@ as on his p@@ i@@ on@@ e@@ er@@ ing work En@@ try into sp@@ ace .
The th@@ ou@@ gh@@ ts of the young eng@@ ine@@ er ( bor@@ n 1@@ 9@@ 0@@ 5 ) left his audience cold , and years later S@@ ter@@ n@@ fel@@ d re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ ed that only Dr. J@@ an G@@ ad@@ o@@ m@@ sk@@ i had sh@@ own an interest in his work .
In 1@@ 9@@ 3@@ 4 , for his work En@@ try into sp@@ ace , S@@ ter@@ n@@ fel@@ d received the Robert E@@ s@@ n@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ -@@ P@@ el@@ ter@@ ie and An@@ d@@ r@@ e Lou@@ is H@@ ir@@ s@@ ch prize in France .
The above mentioned Dr. J@@ an G@@ ad@@ o@@ m@@ sk@@ i ( 18@@ 99 - 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 6 ) later became a strong p@@ ro@@ mo@@ ter of a@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ m@@ y and a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s .
He published hundreds of ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es in Pol@@ ish jo@@ ur@@ n@@ als , and wrote a series of b@@ oo@@ ks on these s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ts .
G@@ ad@@ o@@ m@@ sk@@ i became a wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ known p@@ ro@@ mo@@ ter of a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s and his con@@ tri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on was , n@@ o@@ t@@ ab@@ ly , re@@ co@@ gn@@ ised when a cr@@ ater on the far side of the Mo@@ on was named after him .
In 1925 , Poland had already built a h@@ an@@ d@@ car which was su@@ p@@ posed to be f@@ it@@ ted with a ro@@ cket eng@@ ine .
Un@@ f@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ ately , both the project 's des@@ ig@@ ner , and the project 's details , are un@@ k@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ n .
It is not even clear , whether the ro@@ cket was intended to start the h@@ an@@ d@@ car or to s@@ low it down .
In@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ation about this r@@ a@@ il track is only known from press ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es of the time .
In 1@@ 9@@ 33 the Pol@@ ish art@@ ill@@ er@@ y started their eng@@ age@@ ment in flying b@@ o@@ m@@ bs .
The research was un@@ der@@ taken by the We@@ a@@ p@@ on@@ s Technology Division in c@@ ol@@ l@@ abor@@ ation with Pro@@ f@@ . M@@ i@@ e@@ c@@ z@@ ys@@ law W@@ ol@@ f@@ k@@ e and Pro@@ f@@ . G@@ u@@ st@@ a@@ w Mo@@ k@@ r@@ z@@ y@@ ck@@ i .
From the documents , it is clear that the research re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed the stage of p@@ r@@ ac@@ tic@@ al tests .
Of course , the advance of the German army inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted the research .
In 1@@ 9@@ 37 , the conc@@ ep@@ t of a p@@ h@@ o@@ to@@ electric h@@ o@@ m@@ ing ro@@ cket designed by eng@@ ine@@ er Ro@@ h@@ o@@ z@@ in@@ sk@@ i appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Ro@@ cket - air t@@ or@@ pe@@ do and flying ro@@ ck@@ e@@ t@@ -@@ bomb appeared , a@@ u@@ th@@ o@@ red by L@@ el@@ i@@ w@@ y-@@ Kr@@ y@@ w@@ ob@@ lo@@ ck@@ i .
Both projects were de@@ st@@ in@@ ed for military use of ro@@ cket eng@@ ines .
Im@@ medi@@ ately pri@@ or to the W@@ ar , all projects for military use of ro@@ cket technologies were over@@ seen by the Pro@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on@@ al Sci@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c Ad@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ or@@ y Board ( T@@ y@@ m@@ c@@ z@@ as@@ ow@@ y K@@ o@@ m@@ it@@ et D@@ or@@ ad@@ c@@ zo@@ -@@ N@@ a@@ u@@ k@@ ow@@ y ) that coordinated all the work .
The Board was a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ ted in 1@@ 9@@ 37 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the W@@ ar .
Further work de@@ vo@@ ted to a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s appeared in the Pol@@ ish Press after the W@@ ar th@@ an@@ ks to the Pol@@ ish A@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s Company ( Pol@@ sk@@ ie T@@ ow@@ ar@@ z@@ y@@ st@@ w@@ o A@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ ty@@ c@@ z@@ n@@ e ) .
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Pro@@ ble@@ ms in 1@@ 9@@ 54 , in which four in-@@ depth ar@@ tic@@ l@@ es are on the subject of a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s .
In one of these , by Pro@@ f@@ . Su@@ bo@@ t@@ ow@@ i@@ c@@ z , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would de@@ di@@ c@@ ate itself to a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s .
At the time , there were already projects un@@ der@@ way for ar@@ ti@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ al s@@ at@@ ell@@ it@@ es and it was clear that co@@ s@@ m@@ ic research was an em@@ er@@ g@@ ing sector .
From the beginning of 1@@ 9@@ 56 , the Pol@@ ish A@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s Company ( P@@ T@@ A ) sought ent@@ ry to the International A@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s F@@ e@@ der@@ ation ( est . 1@@ 9@@ 51 ) and by a@@ u@@ t@@ um@@ n the P@@ T@@ A was already a full member .
In the following year , the P@@ T@@ A 's first chairman , K@@ a@@ z@@ im@@ i@@ er@@ z Z@@ ar@@ an@@ k@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ i@@ c@@ z ( 1@@ 9@@ 02 - 1@@ 9@@ 59 ) was a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ ted Deputy Chairman for the International A@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s F@@ e@@ der@@ ation .
He served in this capacity until his death in 1@@ 9@@ 59 .
From 1@@ 9@@ 56 , the P@@ T@@ A played a significant role in the successful development of m@@ e@@ te@@ or@@ ological rockets R@@ M ( R@@ ak@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ a Me@@ te@@ or@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ c@@ z@@ n@@ a ) , which became the first Pol@@ ish ro@@ cket to enable s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c research .
The first R@@ M@@ -@@ 1 model was completed in 1@@ 9@@ 57 and the first launch took place on the 10@@ th of October 1958 .
The ro@@ cket , with a ceiling of 18@@ 00 m@@ e@@ t@@ res , m@@ e@@ as@@ ured around 80 c@@ m in length and w@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ ed a little under 5 k@@ g .
L@@ ater , the improved R@@ M@@ -@@ 1@@ A version was con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ted and in the su@@ m@@ m@@ er of 1@@ 9@@ 59 launch tests were in@@ it@@ i@@ ated for the two-@@ stage R@@ M@@ -@@ 2 ro@@ cket in the B@@ le@@ d@@ ow@@ sky Des@@ er@@ t .
The ro@@ cket was 1.@@ 4 m@@ e@@ t@@ res in length and w@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ ed approximately 1@@ 1.@@ 5 k@@ g .
A further development model was designed for real s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c work - the R@@ M@@ -@@ 3@@ 4 ro@@ cket was to reach 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 5 km and be t@@ asked with monitoring high al@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de winds .
Of course , in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 2 further research was st@@ op@@ p@@ ed .
The successor to the R@@ M ro@@ cket t@@ y@@ p@@ e was the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1 ro@@ cket , developed from 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 2 to 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 5 .
The ro@@ cket was designed as a two-@@ stage ro@@ cket , with a to@@ t@@ al length of 5@@ 10 c@@ m and a launch weight of 3@@ 2.@@ 5 k@@ g .
Th@@ ree mo@@ d@@ el@@ s were developed ( des@@ ign@@ ated Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which di@@ f@@ f@@ ered in the room available for s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c a@@ p@@ par@@ at@@ us .
In the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ A ro@@ cket , a sp@@ ace of 0.@@ 4 lit@@ res was available , Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ B had 0.@@ 3@@ 4 lit@@ res , and Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 1@@ C had 0.@@ 62 lit@@ res .
The m@@ a@@ xim@@ um al@@ t@@ it@@ u@@ de for all three mo@@ d@@ el@@ s was 37@@ km .
Between 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 5 and 1968 , the development of Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2 was un@@ der@@ way in the A@@ er@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ tic@@ s Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 0 .
The Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2 ro@@ cket had a launch weight of 3@@ 80 k@@ g , and was c@@ a@@ p@@ able of li@@ f@@ ting a useful lo@@ ad of 10 k@@ g to a h@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t of around 6@@ 0@@ km .
Sub@@ sequ@@ ent@@ ly built mo@@ d@@ el@@ s were the Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 2@@ H and Me@@ te@@ or-@@ 3 .
Poland 's admission to CO@@ S@@ P@@ A@@ R ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1@@ 9@@ 60 should be mentioned , as well as the a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment of a national CO@@ S@@ P@@ A@@ R board two years later .
Poland also parti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ated in the In@@ ter@@ k@@ o@@ s@@ mo@@ s sp@@ ace programme for sp@@ ace research on Soviet ar@@ ti@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ al s@@ at@@ ell@@ it@@ es , and in 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 8 , the Pol@@ ish pilot Mi@@ ro@@ s@@ law H@@ er@@ m@@ as@@ z@@ e@@ w@@ sk@@ i became the second inter@@ co@@ s@@ m@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ t after Vladimir R@@ em@@ k@@ o@@ v .
Ab@@ ol@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing the legislation on public works is not the solution .
Last week the Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional Court ab@@ ol@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ed the law on public works .
The resolution caused li@@ v@@ ely public debate .
It will certainly be inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing to look at this issue from a bro@@ a@@ der perspective .
Li@@ b@@ er@@ ally ori@@ ent@@ ed financial systems in the EU , just as those in the g@@ lo@@ b@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed world , are based on the p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le of an un@@ regulated economic competition .
Its effect m@@ e@@ ans that in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al financial ent@@ it@@ i@@ es and national economic systems are in a state of per@@ man@@ ent con@@ fli@@ c@@ t among themselves .
The cause is the p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le of free trade and free , com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely un@@ regulated movement of private capital together with un@@ con@@ tro@@ l@@ led financial speculation .
D@@ ue to significant lab@@ our cost differences ( sal@@ ar@@ ies ) there is pressure on prices .
On this b@@ a@@ si@@ s , it should be understood that when a su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ er tri@@ es to compete in a commercial ten@@ der by im@@ p@@ or@@ ting ch@@ e@@ a@@ p g@@ oo@@ ds , " the rug is pulled " from under the competition 's prices to c@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ ure a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
On a wi@@ der sc@@ al@@ e , this m@@ e@@ ans most b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es must move production abroad , im@@ p@@ or@@ t ch@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ ly from abroad , or close down . The result is high un@@ em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment in countries where lab@@ our costs are high compared to other e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ies .
Since private capital is not bo@@ un@@ d by social re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility , and therefore also not by the un@@ em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment it c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ es , the social costs bor@@ n by the state must necessarily increase .
The whole situation is bol@@ st@@ er@@ ed by the b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ man 's complete un@@ w@@ ill@@ in@@ g@@ n@@ ess to pay taxes , which would al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate the e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual st@@ at@@ i@@ st@@ ical data .
The ru@@ th@@ less private capital p@@ r@@ ac@@ ti@@ ces create partic@@ ul@@ ar economic s@@ it@@ u@@ ations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mut@@ ual competition , aim@@ ing to ar@@ ti@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ally lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
In other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while di@@ s@@ regarding the drop in social standards .
This o@@ c@@ cur@@ s ch@@ i@@ e@@ f@@ ly in am@@ en@@ d@@ ments to e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ing law .
The a@@ im is to e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ically force the domestic population to accept prices di@@ c@@ t@@ ated by private capital , especially in terms of sal@@ ar@@ ies .
On one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long-term un@@ em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment , on the other , re@@ stri@@ c@@ ted employee rights in the work@@ place .
This y@@ i@@ el@@ ds growing po@@ v@@ er@@ ty and an increasing vo@@ id between the poor and the rich .
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-@@ out c@@ ent@@ res for the poor , who are not able to fe@@ ed themselves on their own w@@ ag@@ es .
The number of these people is already in the millions .
In the name of im@@ p@@ ro@@ ving the com@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ it@@ i@@ ven@@ ess of the German economy , it com@@ m@@ on@@ ly o@@ c@@ cur@@ s that properly employed people receive such a sal@@ ar@@ y that the State ne@@ e@@ ds to top it up to the minimum w@@ age .
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of a@@ u@@ x@@ ili@@ ar@@ y staff in the B@@ un@@ de@@ st@@ a@@ g .
The a@@ u@@ st@@ er@@ ity measures for all the southern EU states will undoub@@ te@@ d@@ ly lead to the same situation , where people are pre@@ s@@ su@@ red by a cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic drop in living standards to em@@ ig@@ rate as it was in the 1@@ 9@@ th century , or to e@@ k@@ e out an e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence on star@@ v@@ ation w@@ ag@@ es on the e@@ d@@ ge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment .
At this point we have to ask where this may come from ?
If it is to come from other EU states , then po@@ v@@ er@@ ty is being sh@@ i@@ f@@ ted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , B@@ r@@ a@@ z@@ ili@@ an , T@@ ur@@ k@@ ish , Moroccan , Egyptian , and African lab@@ our is still at a fraction of European w@@ ag@@ es .
This app@@ li@@ es to all of Latin America .
Li@@ b@@ er@@ al the@@ or@@ y and the Media inc@@ es@@ s@@ an@@ t@@ ly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a con@@ tro@@ l@@ led economy le@@ ads to economic ru@@ in .
Private capital cru@@ el@@ ly in@@ si@@ st@@ s on the vie@@ w@@ point that the State must not inter@@ ven@@ e in the economy .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ u@@ p@@ on , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually le@@ ads politics and there@@ by the whole country , for its own selfish ends .
Here , the answer must be y@@ es .
The p@@ ro@@ of is the e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence of the almost o@@ m@@ ni@@ po@@ t@@ ent , and in all states , o@@ m@@ ni@@ present lobby .
The result is a des@@ per@@ ate situation manifest@@ ing itself through corruption , through mut@@ ual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is pun@@ i@@ s@@ hab@@ le .
In Germany the situation is such that state m@@ in@@ i@@ st@@ ries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the dra@@ f@@ ting of la@@ ws to private law firms , who are basically con@@ ne@@ c@@ ted with industry .
These la@@ ws are then approved in the B@@ un@@ de@@ st@@ a@@ g .
Real power does not come from the people as the W@@ e@@ st@@ ern@@ -@@ style con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tions claim , but from strong financial or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ations that look after their own interests .
It is clear that liber@@ all@@ y-@@ ori@@ ent@@ ated de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ ies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by A@@ p@@ p@@ ian in his work on the R@@ o@@ m@@ an Re@@ public C@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ is in the time of C@@ es@@ ar and P@@ o@@ m@@ pe@@ i : " The State was already long in complete de@@ generation and its offices taken by force .
With bri@@ bery , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with st@@ on@@ es or s@@ words .
Bri@@ bery and corruption were ri@@ f@@ e and un@@ h@@ in@@ der@@ ed , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought " ... " people with p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es did not run for office , so on one o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on the whole de@@ b@@ ac@@ le meant the state went eight months without con@@ su@@ ls .. " .. " There was actually talk about the only answer to this ter@@ ri@@ ble situation being a@@ u@@ to@@ cr@@ acy , and an en@@ er@@ g@@ e@@ tic man should be elected . " A@@ p@@ p@@ ian had P@@ o@@ m@@ pe@@ i in mind , but it was C@@ es@@ ar who changed de@@ mo@@ cr@@ acy for a@@ u@@ to@@ cr@@ acy per@@ man@@ ent@@ ly .
The conclusion , just as in an@@ ti@@ qu@@ ity , the current society is built on unsc@@ ru@@ p@@ ul@@ ou@@ s ten@@ den@@ c@@ i@@ es for per@@ s@@ on@@ al gain without re@@ g@@ ar@@ d to the interests of society as a whole .
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
The outcome is now , as it was then , an un@@ pre@@ c@@ e@@ d@@ ent@@ ed de@@ c@@ ad@@ ence of the elite with no at@@ te@@ mp@@ ts w@@ h@@ at@@ so@@ ever on de@@ ep@@ er re@@ a@@ ch@@ ing re@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ s .
The c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ality of the rise of the f@@ as@@ c@@ ist and com@@ m@@ un@@ ist re@@ g@@ im@@ es should therefore be sought in the mis@@ g@@ u@@ i@@ ded liber@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ation of the economic system in the 1@@ 9@@ th and 20@@ th c@@ ent@@ ur@@ ies .
The current state of affairs , when we consider the de@@ mis@@ e of those systems in favour of liber@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed de@@ mo@@ cr@@ acy as an inter@@ lu@@ de , can expect its next c@@ y@@ c@@ le .
The particularly cat@@ ast@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic reality is that the current elite is com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely ig@@ n@@ or@@ ing the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of li@@ ves , h@@ um@@ an@@ it@@ ar@@ ian and social di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers , which we are already w@@ it@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ ing , as well as crimes against h@@ um@@ an@@ ity , as we are fam@@ ili@@ ar with from an@@ c@@ i@@ ent and modern history .
The ab@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ on of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term .
Under the pressure of economic competition , inter@@ nation@@ ally as well as within Europe , the Government of the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public will be forced to pur@@ su@@ e ways of lo@@ w@@ er@@ ing the population 's living standards .
This p@@ at@@ ter@@ n is th@@ us sy@@ st@@ em@@ ic .
To address this , there are targeted political and social re@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ s , which str@@ eng@@ then the state 's capital participation in the economy , increase the people 's influence over the state and w@@ e@@ ak@@ en the m@@ on@@ op@@ ol@@ y held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
Israel : Cha@@ os L@@ ab .
" N@@ o@@ thing comes from viol@@ ence and nothing ever could , " from St@@ ing 's F@@ r@@ ag@@ ile , where one of the main v@@ er@@ s@@ es from the re@@ f@@ r@@ a@@ in is " L@@ est we f@@ or@@ get how f@@ r@@ ag@@ ile we are . "
" If my s@@ on@@ s did not want war , there would be n@@ one , " said the d@@ y@@ ing G@@ ut@@ le S@@ ch@@ n@@ a@@ p@@ per , wife of M@@ ay@@ er Am@@ s@@ ch@@ el Roth@@ s@@ ch@@ il@@ d in 18@@ 49 .
The latest wave of viol@@ ence between Israel and the G@@ a@@ z@@ a stri@@ p , as always , has sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ed a lot of re@@ action .
Some st@@ and by Israel , ar@@ g@@ u@@ ing it has the right to self-@@ def@@ ence , and Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans are p@@ or@@ tra@@ y@@ ed as ter@@ r@@ or@@ ists , while others support the Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans , c@@ la@@ im@@ ing r@@ ac@@ ism by the Israeli state , c@@ la@@ im@@ ing that gen@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ de is being committed against Palestinian Arab@@ s , and that Israel is a terrorist state .
I do not want to d@@ well , in these re@@ pe@@ ated per@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ c w@@ av@@ es of killing , on who is the trans@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ or and who is the victim , after all , today 's in@@ hab@@ it@@ an@@ ts of Israel , including the self-@@ governing ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies , were bor@@ n into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the viol@@ ence .
I would like to offer the readers a pe@@ ek behind the sc@@ en@@ es , a look at whom , most of all , this 9@@ 5-@@ year long tension is serving ( starting from B@@ al@@ four 's de@@ c@@ l@@ ar@@ ation in November 1917 ) on this small piece of land in the M@@ id@@ d@@ le East .
Some of my th@@ ou@@ gh@@ ts are su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
Human history is in the first instance about the st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ le for power .
In every era we can find an Ale@@ x@@ an@@ der the Great or a Nap@@ ol@@ e@@ on .
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their p@@ ath in@@ de@@ p@@ en@@ d@@ ent@@ ly , or whether behind their th@@ r@@ one st@@ ood someone who directed their actions towards a pre@@ -@@ c@@ al@@ c@@ ul@@ ated goal .
We must accept that we live in a time when the world 's wealth is con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ated into the hands of a few in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als , and that this con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ation of wealth and the power it e@@ x@@ u@@ des could not happen in one generation 's li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an .
Among these a@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ m@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the p@@ u@@ p@@ pet m@@ a@@ ster ( whether someone else stands above them , I am un@@ sure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ s@@ ch@@ il@@ ds .
Not much is w@@ r@@ it@@ ten about them .
Under@@ stand@@ ab@@ ly .
The first news agency ( Reuters ) they bought in the 90 's of the 1@@ 9@@ th century , in order to prevent their name being con@@ ne@@ c@@ ted with acts of high c@@ ri@@ m@@ in@@ ality , which appeared in their background and which always meant se@@ cur@@ ing power , increasing wealth , or both .
They hold majority st@@ ak@@ es in almost every central b@@ an@@ k in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either w@@ ag@@ ing or pre@@ par@@ ing for war ( before the assault on A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the over@@ throw of K@@ ad@@ d@@ af@@ i 4 remained , but in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time Russia sub@@ mit@@ ted its central b@@ an@@ k to the R@@ us@@ si@@ an Government ) .
W@@ h@@ o@@ ever attempted to def@@ y this family died .
Ab@@ r@@ a@@ ham L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n refused to rene@@ w the status of the central b@@ an@@ k to the Roth@@ s@@ ch@@ il@@ d Bank of America , and during the Ci@@ vi@@ l W@@ ar he began to issue his own ( that is st@@ at@@ e-@@ issued ) money and was as@@ s@@ as@@ s@@ in@@ ated in 18@@ 65 at the the@@ at@@ re .
J@@ F@@ K began i@@ s@@ su@@ ing his own money and wanted to close the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 3 , Con@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ man Lou@@ is McFadden was po@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ ed in 1@@ 9@@ 36 , after he had intended to su@@ e the Fed for c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ing the Great De@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on of 1@@ 9@@ 2@@ 9 .
Their th@@ ir@@ s@@ t for global power led in the years of 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to the f@@ or@@ m@@ ul@@ ation of a th@@ re@@ e-@@ wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ war plan by the fre@@ em@@ as@@ on leader of the 3@@ 3@@ r@@ d degree , Albert P@@ i@@ k@@ e .
The first war was to re@@ move the large m@@ on@@ ar@@ ch@@ ic state bodies in Europe , the second was to re@@ move colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world 's population down to 0.@@ 5 - 1 billion people ( this number of s@@ la@@ ves will su@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ e for their com@@ f@@ or@@ t and lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y , and will not use up so many resources ) , the c@@ re@@ ation of one universal f@@ a@@ it@@ h ( ec@@ um@@ en@@ ism is just an app@@ e@@ t@@ iser for this solution ) , and finally the s@@ e@@ i@@ z@@ ing of ab@@ sol@@ ute power .
The method , which the group of w@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y families with the Roth@@ s@@ ch@@ il@@ ds leading the way , em@@ p@@ lo@@ y is the in@@ st@@ ig@@ ation of c@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ es , fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed by the off@@ er@@ ing of a solution ( order ab ch@@ a@@ o - order from ch@@ a@@ os ) .
These solutions are f@@ al@@ se , however , and always lead to a wor@@ se situation ( vi@@ de establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 1@@ 9@@ 0@@ 7 would not be re@@ pe@@ ated ) .
Th@@ us , having su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ ded in as@@ s@@ as@@ s@@ in@@ ating F@@ er@@ d@@ in@@ and , the H@@ ab@@ s@@ bur@@ g h@@ e@@ i@@ r to the Au@@ st@@ ro@@ -@@ H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian th@@ r@@ one , in S@@ ar@@ aj@@ e@@ v@@ o there@@ by un@@ le@@ ash@@ ing World W@@ ar I , they de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed t@@ s@@ ar@@ ist Russia with the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ k re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on .
The First World W@@ ar ended ab@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ ly , m@@ il@@ it@@ ar@@ il@@ y and e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ically un@@ sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ated , with German c@@ a@@ p@@ it@@ ul@@ ation ( the war was no longer needed to de@@ st@@ ro@@ y t@@ s@@ ar@@ ist Russia ) and the central European powers of Au@@ stri@@ a@@ -@@ H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y were sub@@ sequ@@ ent@@ ly di@@ s@@ man@@ t@@ led .
To f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ate the inc@@ ep@@ ti@@ on of the S@@ e@@ con@@ d World W@@ ar , they allowed b@@ an@@ k@@ ers and p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans to create a lat@@ ent con@@ fli@@ c@@ t situation by sa@@ d@@ d@@ ling Germany with huge war re@@ par@@ ations , there@@ by making a r@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ alist example of the im@@ po@@ v@@ er@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ed m@@ as@@ s@@ es , it remained only to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce a su@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ ly con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing c@@ ul@@ pri@@ t and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a mul@@ ti@@ -@@ r@@ ac@@ ial C@@ z@@ e@@ ch@@ os@@ lo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia with a strong German minority to play , and in@@ de@@ ed did , the role of a fifth col@@ ony , once the war had been ign@@ it@@ ed .
At the end of the 1@@ 9@@ th C@@ ent@@ ur@@ y , the Roth@@ s@@ ch@@ il@@ ds in@@ st@@ ig@@ ated the establishment of the Z@@ i@@ on@@ ist movement , one b@@ r@@ an@@ ch of which st@@ ro@@ v@@ e to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ de@@ a , J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m , to make its capital ( the Ret@@ ur@@ n to Z@@ ion ) .
The af@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned B@@ al@@ four Dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation formed the b@@ a@@ si@@ s for the m@@ ass immigration of Jews to Pal@@ e@@ st@@ ine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population .
Terr@@ or@@ ist att@@ ac@@ ks occurred on both sides .
World W@@ ar I@@ I broke out , and whether H@@ it@@ ler broke free from the le@@ ash , which international b@@ an@@ k@@ ers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , ne@@ v@@ er@@ th@@ el@@ ess the su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing of European Jews in the con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ation camps created the foundation to the world 's ac@@ c@@ ep@@ t@@ ance of the Jewish State .
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war re@@ par@@ ations for World W@@ ar I@@ I were l@@ ay@@ ed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war 's h@@ o@@ t@@ bed .
Provi@@ ded the international b@@ an@@ k@@ ers su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed , the Jewish Nation , as with the second , will be the v@@ i@@ c@@ tim@@ s on the front line , now together with the Arab@@ ic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the M@@ id@@ d@@ le East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of di@@ sc@@ or@@ d and ch@@ a@@ os not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how str@@ on@@ g@@ ly people are sp@@ lit into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Who is the w@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ do@@ er and who is the victim in the Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ e-@@ Israel con@@ fli@@ c@@ t , where in@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ c@@ e bre@@ e@@ ds in@@ j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ c@@ e in an en@@ d@@ less c@@ y@@ c@@ le of viol@@ ence , while everything began from the g@@ re@@ ed of a few and their l@@ us@@ t for global power ?
Here , we must di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ate between Israel 's general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international b@@ an@@ k@@ ers in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
Israel 's current prime minister , N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u ' the ha@@ w@@ k ' , is a typical example of a f@@ as@@ c@@ ist politician , loyal to the international b@@ an@@ k@@ ers , who does everything to in@@ st@@ ig@@ ate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the Sh@@ ang@@ ha@@ i C@@ o@@ operation Or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation ( China , India , Russia , P@@ ak@@ i@@ st@@ an , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global con@@ fli@@ c@@ t , and through its control of the H@@ or@@ m@@ u@@ z St@@ r@@ a@@ it , where 20 % of the world 's oil must sa@@ il ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world 's economy .
In what light st@@ and the words , sp@@ o@@ ken by David Ro@@ ck@@ e@@ f@@ ell@@ er in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 : " All we need is a major crisis and the n@@ ations will accept the New World Order . "
The New World Order in their eyes is one of m@@ a@@ ster and s@@ la@@ v@@ e .
A world where the rest of the human population serve the lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y of a h@@ an@@ d@@ ful of financial ar@@ i@@ st@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at@@ s .
A world , where each new@@ -@@ bor@@ n is im@@ pl@@ an@@ ted with a chip , which makes their e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ated .
" He also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and s@@ la@@ v@@ e , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell un@@ less he had the mark , which is the name of the be@@ ast or the number of his name .
If anyone has in@@ si@@ g@@ h@@ t , let him c@@ al@@ c@@ ul@@ ate the number of the be@@ ast ,
for it is man 's number . His number is six hundred and six@@ ty six . "
Ar@@ go : When things are at their worst - call Hollywood .
In November 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 9 , a mo@@ b of Islamic student demonstrators took over the American em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y in Tehran and held 52 diplomats h@@ o@@ stage .
They were to be released in exchange for the over@@ thrown Shah M@@ oh@@ am@@ m@@ a@@ d Re@@ z@@ a P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi , who f@@ led after the re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on to the USA , which had actually su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted his regime for several decades .
For the American administration the situation did not offer a po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e solution - it could not throw the Shah over@@ board , because this would seriously je@@ op@@ ar@@ di@@ se the trust of other al@@ li@@ ed countries .
The release of the h@@ o@@ st@@ ag@@ es in Iran , where the re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on resulted in the establishment of the the@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at@@ i@@ c regime , could not be achieved .
This was a b@@ low to the pre@@ st@@ ig@@ e of the United States , which was later com@@ po@@ unded by the fi@@ as@@ co of attempting to free the h@@ o@@ st@@ ag@@ es by force .
The inc@@ ar@@ c@@ er@@ ated diplomats were finally released after 4@@ 44 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Al@@ ger@@ ian government .
Their or@@ deal provoked a wave of so@@ li@@ d@@ ar@@ ity and anti-@@ Iranian fe@@ el@@ ings at home .
The de@@ b@@ ac@@ le in Iran si@@ gn@@ ific@@ an@@ t@@ ly in@@ f@@ lu@@ en@@ c@@ ed Jimmy Car@@ ter 's loss with R@@ on@@ al@@ d Re@@ agan in the 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0 presidential elections .
The film Ar@@ go , directed by the actor Ben A@@ f@@ f@@ le@@ ck , re@@ counts one episode in this story , which brought America a small victory .
Just before the em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y was seized , six employees escaped .
After some per@@ i@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ i@@ a , they ended up in the Canadian am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or 's re@@ si@@ den@@ ce .
The CI@@ A , in c@@ ol@@ l@@ abor@@ ation with the Canadian authorities , su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ ded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an e@@ x@@ tra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant cover story - they left on Canadian p@@ as@@ sp@@ or@@ ts as members of a film c@@ re@@ w , who were s@@ ur@@ ve@@ y@@ ing locations for a s@@ c@@ i@@ -@@ f@@ i blo@@ ck@@ b@@ u@@ ster .
A combination of gen@@ res
The plan , conceived by " e@@ x@@ fil@@ tr@@ ation " expert , Tony M@@ en@@ dez , re@@ qu@@ i@@ red the assistance of Hollywood .
For the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were or@@ g@@ an@@ ised , and the fic@@ t@@ it@@ i@@ ou@@ s production company had a real office .
The details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film dra@@ ws on the m@@ em@@ or@@ ies of Tony M@@ en@@ dez .
A@@ f@@ f@@ le@@ ck 's film is a p@@ ec@@ u@@ liar m@@ i@@ x of gen@@ res .
On one hand , there is a real@@ istic inc@@ i@@ s@@ ive political thriller , and at the same time a " c@@ a@@ p@@ er movie , " with small victories and dou@@ ble@@ -@@ c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing - another example would be Ocean 's E@@ le@@ v@@ en .
The mood al@@ ter@@ n@@ at@@ es in the film - on one side , sharp doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ar@@ y-@@ style sequ@@ en@@ ces in Tehran ( the title sequ@@ ence shows i@@ c@@ on@@ ic photos from news of the time , re@@ lat@@ ing to the same events p@@ or@@ tra@@ y@@ ed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
On the other hand , li@@ gh@@ ter sections from Hollywood , l@@ ac@@ ed with ir@@ ony and a little e@@ x@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation .
Th@@ en there are sc@@ en@@ es from the CI@@ A headquarters and other ag@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es - men in su@@ its de@@ b@@ ating the situation around meeting tables , in office corridors , over the phone ...
Ben A@@ f@@ f@@ le@@ ck has managed to re@@ start his career in e@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ y style .
The der@@ i@@ ded actor has become a re@@ sp@@ ec@@ ted director , and his ac@@ ting is no longer the target of ir@@ on@@ ic comments .
Ar@@ go is his third b@@ ig@@ -@@ screen movie , following his dark crime movie G@@ one Bab@@ y G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the thriller The T@@ own ( 20@@ 10 ) .
It is also A@@ f@@ f@@ le@@ ck 's first picture , which does not take place in the director 's h@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ own of Boston .
The atmosp@@ heric feel in different locations is one of the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ st@@ ics , which took his earlier fil@@ ms above Hollywood standards .
A@@ f@@ f@@ le@@ ck shows it in Ar@@ go , where Tehran is " fe@@ at@@ ured " by Canada .
The best sc@@ en@@ es of the film take place in the streets , in the re@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction of real events - the opening sequ@@ ence of the si@@ e@@ ge on the em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y is impres@@ si@@ v@@ ely lu@@ c@@ id , creating at once fe@@ el@@ ings of con@@ f@@ u@@ si@@ on and surprise , which come f@@ loo@@ ding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
A similar effect is achieved by A@@ f@@ f@@ le@@ ck and his team in the fic@@ t@@ it@@ i@@ ou@@ s sc@@ en@@ es ( the f@@ ak@@ e staff at the Tehran b@@ a@@ z@@ a@@ ar ) .
T@@ o@@ o much action in too many plac@@ es
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many n@@ a@@ il@@ -@@ b@@ it@@ ing sc@@ en@@ es for the film .
What little there is , is worked well , with some o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on@@ al em@@ b@@ ell@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ments to reality - these do not all come off so el@@ e@@ g@@ an@@ t@@ ly ( the scene , where a lo@@ o@@ m@@ ing crisis is aver@@ ted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America , fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed by a ch@@ as@@ e on the r@@ un@@ way seems quite f@@ ar@@ -@@ f@@ e@@ t@@ ched ) .
Ar@@ go 's w@@ e@@ ak@@ n@@ ess is its di@@ v@@ er@@ gen@@ ce , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many plac@@ es .
Alan Ar@@ k@@ in and John G@@ oo@@ d@@ man play their roles as the Hollywood as@@ si@@ st@@ an@@ ts with great char@@ m ; their characters des@@ er@@ v@@ e more room , and are not by far the only on@@ es in this film .
A@@ f@@ f@@ le@@ ck 's film lo@@ s@@ es the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be w@@ at@@ ched with reasonable interest , its production and re@@ tro@@ -@@ style are e@@ voc@@ ative of th@@ r@@ ill@@ ers from the 70 's .
It does not really c@@ a@@ p@@ tiv@@ ate .
As a re@@ m@@ in@@ der of history 's partic@@ ul@@ ar ways and a te@@ st@@ im@@ ony to how e@@ x@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated the vie@@ ws are on the all-@@ powerful all-@@ con@@ tro@@ l@@ ling secret services , this will do .
R@@ ul@@ es for b@@ lo@@ w@@ ing up bal@@ lo@@ on@@ s , for b@@ an@@ an@@ as and a c@@ ir@@ c@@ us
The www.@@ b@@ an@@ kov@@ n@@ i@@ p@@ op@@ lat@@ k@@ y@@ .com server , which issues a poll every year on the most ab@@ s@@ ur@@ d b@@ an@@ k charge , has now decided to an@@ n@@ o@@ un@@ ce a competition for " the most ab@@ s@@ ur@@ d re@@ g@@ ul@@ ation or proposal from the EU . "
" We were p@@ ro@@ mp@@ ted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent qu@@ o@@ t@@ a of women at management level of Europe 's largest companies , " P@@ at@@ ri@@ k N@@ a@@ ch@@ er , the poll 's or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ er , told Pra@@ v@@ o .
Among the latest nominated ab@@ s@@ ur@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ es , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to un@@ i@@ f@@ y insurance pre@@ m@@ i@@ um@@ s for men and women .
Un@@ ti@@ l now , women were f@@ av@@ oured in life insurance prices , because they con@@ st@@ it@@ ute a lower risk for in@@ s@@ ur@@ ers .
" Other un@@ b@@ el@@ i@@ e@@ vable i@@ de@@ as from the EU can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year .
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 20@@ 13 , " in@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ed N@@ a@@ ch@@ er .
Among the controversial EU re@@ g@@ ul@@ ations , we might include the mandatory addition of b@@ i@@ o-@@ in@@ g@@ re@@ di@@ ent@@ s to f@@ u@@ el , which con@@ sequ@@ ent@@ ly har@@ ms the environment , the ban on reliable mer@@ cur@@ y th@@ er@@ m@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ ters just because they contain a relatively small quant@@ ity of a to@@ x@@ ic substance , or the r@@ ul@@ es on the size of chicken c@@ ag@@ es , which si@@ gn@@ ific@@ an@@ t@@ ly raised eg@@ g prices this year .
The ban on the use of the term " sp@@ read@@ able butter " and the withdrawal of classic light bul@@ bs from sale had previously come under criticism .
First rate b@@ an@@ an@@ as are to measure 14 c@@ en@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ res
The Union 's machine often makes de@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on@@ s under pressure from this or that commercial or in@@ du@@ stri@@ al lobbying group , whose de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ s in Brussels are usually def@@ ended by state or group of states ' interests ( just as the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public is promoting the de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ s of its banks under threat of being v@@ e@@ t@@ o@@ ed ) .
The lobby 's interests were , for example , that b@@ an@@ an@@ as of the highest quality should measure at least 14 c@@ m in the EU , and were not to display and " an@@ o@@ m@@ al@@ ou@@ s cur@@ v@@ ature . "
The European Commission def@@ ended itself , saying that it was only harmon@@ i@@ s@@ ing e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ing di@@ s@@ jo@@ in@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading .
Nor@@ ms re@@ lat@@ ing to f@@ ru@@ it and vegetables have already been sof@@ ten@@ ed by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ing direc@@ ti@@ ves .
One possible pri@@ ze-@@ win@@ ner in the poll may be the last year 's EU re@@ g@@ ul@@ ation according to which in@@ f@@ lat@@ able bal@@ lo@@ on@@ s must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not infl@@ ate them without par@@ ent@@ al super@@ vision .
Here , the EU po@@ in@@ ted to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , bal@@ lo@@ on@@ s are one of the main c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ es of child su@@ f@@ f@@ o@@ c@@ ation .
A similar re@@ stri@@ ction now app@@ li@@ es to children under 14 years of age us@@ ing party blo@@ wers .
St@@ range i@@ de@@ as are conceived at home too
Fair@@ ly ab@@ s@@ ur@@ d is the rule re@@ lat@@ ing to in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al European officials - everyone in the EU , who h@@ ol@@ ds an official post , may not use the term Mac@@ e@@ d@@ on@@ ia due to it being a sen@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e t@@ op@@ ic for G@@ re@@ e@@ ce , and instead the ac@@ ron@@ ym F@@ Y@@ RO@@ M ( Former Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ la@@ v Re@@ public of Mac@@ e@@ d@@ on@@ ia ) should be used .
The Ban@@ kov@@ n@@ i@@ p@@ op@@ lat@@ k@@ y@@ .com server in c@@ ol@@ l@@ abor@@ ation with the Li@@ b@@ er@@ al E@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ist Association , La@@ i@@ s@@ se@@ z F@@ aire , also nominated , aside from the af@@ o@@ re@@ mentioned ab@@ s@@ ur@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ es , for example the Union 's re@@ g@@ ul@@ ation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state .
The EU st@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ated the m@@ a@@ xim@@ um v@@ ol@@ um@@ es of food provisions , which may be present within the C@@ R on the day of our ent@@ ry to the Union .
The C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public there@@ after e@@ x@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ ded , for instance , the per@@ mit@@ ted volume of mush@@ room pre@@ serves , which incur@@ red a high p@@ en@@ al@@ ty .
The poll 's organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a co@@ ast@@ line , or the suggestion of al@@ lo@@ c@@ ating f@@ un@@ ding for a request for f@@ un@@ ding .
These i@@ de@@ as did not come from Brussels , however , but from Prague .
" We are h@@ an@@ di@@ c@@ apped because we do not have the sea .
We are asking the European Union for a re@@ f@@ un@@ d , " de@@ c@@ la@@ red the minister for ag@@ ri@@ culture , back in a@@ u@@ t@@ um@@ n 2004 , J@@ ar@@ o@@ s@@ la@@ v Pal@@ as ( CS@@ S@@ D ) .
His ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent was that there had been a good har@@ v@@ est of c@@ er@@ e@@ als , and due to the so@@ -@@ called b@@ u@@ y-@@ out inter@@ ven@@ tions , the state 's w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ s@@ es were full and were forced to e@@ x@@ p@@ or@@ t .
The C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public is further away from a p@@ or@@ t , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of E@@ u@@ ro@@ s .
The European Commission finally met the C@@ R halfway by or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ing a ten@@ der for the pur@@ ch@@ as@@ e of c@@ er@@ e@@ als from countries that do not have access to the sea .
F@@ unding to sub@@ si@@ di@@ se f@@ un@@ ding re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s was offered to fore@@ ign@@ ers by the Ministry for Re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al Development 's minister , P@@ av@@ el N@@ em@@ e@@ c ( US@@ -@@ D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s for f@@ un@@ ding from Brussels .
EU : B@@ iz@@ ar@@ re legislation is the e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ on
Reg@@ ul@@ ations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU 's efforts at re@@ g@@ ul@@ ation , more effective operation , and development of the en@@ ti@@ re Union des@@ er@@ v@@ e recognition , according to a number of experts .
A more important issue , according to experts , is the dra@@ wing of EU funds on projects , which have har@@ d@@ ly anything in common with str@@ eng@@ th@@ en@@ ing the European in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ation , but which was pushed through by member states during a b@@ u@@ d@@ get meeting .
E@@ mo@@ tions f@@ l@@ are among C@@ z@@ e@@ ch@@ s when , just as other countries in the Union , the C@@ R must fight in Brussels for the right to partic@@ ul@@ ar lab@@ ell@@ ing on its traditional products , in which it does not always su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed .
The C@@ z@@ e@@ ch@@ s fought for six years with the Germans and Au@@ stri@@ ans to protect the lab@@ ell@@ ing of their O@@ l@@ o@@ m@@ ou@@ ck@@ e t@@ v@@ ar@@ u@@ z@@ ky , however the tu@@ z@@ em@@ sky rum , whose tradition re@@ a@@ ch@@ es back to the 1@@ 9@@ th century here , had to be ren@@ amed tu@@ z@@ em@@ ak by the man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ ers .
The app@@ ell@@ ation of rum can only be given to products di@@ st@@ ill@@ ed from can@@ e su@@ gar , and not su@@ gar be@@ et .
Car@@ l@@ s@@ bad w@@ af@@ ers , Po@@ h@@ o@@ re@@ li@@ cky and T@@ re@@ b@@ on@@ sky car@@ p , and Z@@ ate@@ c h@@ op@@ s have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , al@@ on@@ g@@ side the wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ ren@@ owned f@@ e@@ t@@ a ch@@ e@@ ese and g@@ or@@ g@@ on@@ z@@ ola , German m@@ ar@@ z@@ i@@ p@@ an from L@@ u@@ be@@ ck , and P@@ ar@@ m@@ a ham .
The EU 's stamp of protection can also be proudly sh@@ own on P@@ ar@@ du@@ b@@ i@@ c@@ e g@@ in@@ g@@ er@@ bre@@ ad and H@@ or@@ ick@@ y t@@ u@@ b@@ es .
People want me to save the republic , but I am an am@@ ate@@ u@@ r , says Ok@@ am@@ ura
Sen@@ ator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ?
This is not about me being a sen@@ ator or president .
If everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post .
I cannot watch any longer the country having been ro@@ b@@ bed over the past tw@@ enty years , th@@ i@@ e@@ ves ro@@ aming about there and people 's taxes and retirement age increasing .
I had no ambition to be a politician .
When I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things .
Since I have already turned f@@ or@@ ty , and I am an independent n@@ on-@@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to st@@ and for sen@@ ator or president .
You have already re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed the Senate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the C@@ ast@@ le .
Are you not turning your back on those who vo@@ ted for you in doing this ?
I have been saying the en@@ ti@@ re time that I would fight for the C@@ ast@@ le based on the results in the Senate 's elections .
L@@ ater , I added that if I were elected as sen@@ ator , I would be standing for president .
My goal , though , is not the post , the post is a t@@ oo@@ l to al@@ low my vision to be re@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ f@@ or@@ e , I need the greatest influence , and the str@@ on@@ g@@ es@@ t m@@ an@@ d@@ ate possible .
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pu@@ b or at the television , but that we tr@@ am@@ p@@ le anyone , who wants to try to change things .
The Media add to this , mis@@ leading the public , and m@@ i@@ st@@ aking freedom of speech with freedom to li@@ e .
For example , I was al@@ le@@ g@@ e@@ d@@ ly bri@@ b@@ ing reporters , or I was al@@ le@@ g@@ e@@ d@@ ly an ad@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ or of J@@ ir@@ i P@@ ar@@ ou@@ be@@ k .
Let 's talk about your vision .
You set out on your castle si@@ e@@ ge with a thes@@ is on the material and criminal re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ es of politics , and a re@@ tro@@ active financial di@@ sc@@ lo@@ s@@ ure of assets over tw@@ enty million .
You need to change the law for this .
As president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Senate as a whole may p@@ ro@@ po@@ se la@@ ws .
How are you going to sol@@ v@@ e this ?
When I lo@@ b@@ b@@ i@@ ed , as a c@@ it@@ i@@ zen , for t@@ our g@@ u@@ i@@ de work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
The problem is political s@@ qu@@ ab@@ b@@ l@@ ing - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliber@@ ately re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted , c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ing d@@ el@@ ay@@ s for the public .
As an independent n@@ on-@@ party man , I st@@ and a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
The advantage I hold is that without the political p@@ i@@ g@@ e@@ on@@ h@@ ol@@ ing or dog@@ m@@ as I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
D@@ o you see yo@@ ur@@ self as a person from the right , or the left ?
From the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch vie@@ w@@ point , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
For me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right .
The important part for me is moving forward .
It is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ SC@@ M or the O@@ D@@ S , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad i@@ de@@ as .
You get an@@ g@@ r@@ y when someone calls you a pop@@ ul@@ ist .
Are you not con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ing this with what you have st@@ ated ?
When you make a company business plan , you also have some i@@ de@@ al goal and vision .
You try to come close to it .
Some may call it pop@@ ul@@ ism , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
But without the support of the P@@ ar@@ li@@ am@@ ent you will be left with just s@@ lo@@ g@@ an@@ s .
You will not last long in politics with that .
Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ ed , say , in passing criminal and material re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility ?
I have no alternative .
I need to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans , reporters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
If I were elected president , it would not be a problem to ar@@ range a live television bro@@ ad@@ cast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility for p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans , civil s@@ er@@ v@@ an@@ ts , j@@ ud@@ g@@ es , and the A@@ tt@@ or@@ ne@@ y General .
And , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this .
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just ne@@ e@@ ds some pressure on the political scene .
Take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved th@@ an@@ ks to public pressure .
I will say f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ly that I am an am@@ ate@@ u@@ r , I am not a gen@@ i@@ us or an intellectual .
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision .
I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my ag@@ en@@ d@@ a .
I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
It sounds a little like Ok@@ am@@ ura is trying to save the C@@ z@@ e@@ ch Re@@ public .
I am no sa@@ vi@@ our .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces , whether they would run for the sen@@ ate .
I went to R@@ a@@ di@@ m J@@ an@@ cur@@ a , who de@@ c@@ l@@ in@@ ed due to his work@@ lo@@ ad .
So I , at least , support in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ ative journalist , J@@ an@@ a L@@ or@@ en@@ co@@ v@@ a , who un@@ co@@ v@@ er@@ ed f@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ d@@ ul@@ ent activity with light heating oil .
I put myself forward , because people are really di@@ s@@ con@@ t@@ ent@@ ed , but now I have my dou@@ b@@ ts .
S@@ i@@ x@@ ty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly vo@@ ted for leaders of the establishment .
In the sen@@ ate , there are only two in@@ de@@ p@@ en@@ d@@ ent@@ s , including me .
People have vo@@ ted for a sen@@ ate that will make it difficult to en@@ force changes .
N@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of m@@ ay@@ ors or regional council pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent@@ s .
Are you con@@ si@@ der@@ ing having your own party ?
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to v@@ er@@ i@@ f@@ y that every party member has a c@@ le@@ an background , nor the money to do it .
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my tr@@ an@@ spar@@ ent account h@@ ol@@ ds just 20 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and .
You have no money ?
You are talking about financial di@@ sc@@ lo@@ su@@ res , but what is yo@@ ur@@ s like ?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million .
In Prague , I have land worth around 25 million , an a@@ p@@ art@@ ment worth ten million , another a@@ p@@ art@@ ment worth eight million , an art@@ work collection worth around ten million , an A@@ st@@ on Martin worth 3@@ .@@ 5 million , a S@@ k@@ o@@ d@@ a Su@@ per@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account .
I have the A@@ st@@ on Martin , by the way , because it was my d@@ re@@ am as a boy - I always liked James Bond , who drove the car , was g@@ all@@ ant with women and also fought against evi@@ l and v@@ il@@ la@@ in@@ y .
You drive an A@@ st@@ on Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ?
You say you want to change the Re@@ public , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
This does not in@@ sp@@ ir@@ e much confidence .
I do not have 15 million for a campaign .
Should I take out a lo@@ an ?
I have already put 2.@@ 5 million into the campaign .
The fact that I do not have any sp@@ on@@ s@@ ors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme .
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
The e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ d@@ it@@ ure on my campaign is basically co@@ v@@ er@@ ed by the pay I will be receiving as a sen@@ ator .
However , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son 's English school , which costs 30 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and a month .
If I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election .
So you will still be in business so that you can make a living ?
Did you not say you would be putting this on hold ?
This de@@ p@@ en@@ ds on the rate of pay .
As I p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed , my activities have been parti@@ ally reduced .
For example , my de@@ p@@ ut@@ y is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in sp@@ r@@ ing .
People would like me to be a S@@ am@@ ar@@ it@@ an , who sa@@ ves the Re@@ public .
But I must also live off something .
As a b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ man , what would you usually make monthly ?
Two hundred to 4@@ 00 th@@ ou@@ s@@ and , which I still do .
And if I became president , then I would end my business activity .

The M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts prove that tru@@ e ad@@ v@@ ent@@ u@@ res are not just in the head - dra@@ wing on the example of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se and the recently er@@ ec@@ ted B@@ ü@@ ch@@ er@@ berg ( lit@@ er@@ ally " book mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in " ) - 2 photos
" I think the building is fun , looks f@@ ut@@ ur@@ istic and ultimately provides something inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing to look at , " said L@@ i@@ s@@ ette V@@ er@@ ha@@ i@@ g , a p@@ as@@ s@@ er@@ -@@ by at the ro@@ ad@@ -@@ side .
And S@@ te@@ f@@ an S@@ per@@ m@@ on , IT te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ an in a major firm based nearby commented : " It 's de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely a thing of beauty , the building . "
However , I do w@@ on@@ der why people would need another li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ y in this day and age .
E@@ very@@ one has the Internet , an i@@ P@@ ad and e@@ Boo@@ ks .
N@@ o@@ -@@ one go@@ es into one of these ol@@ d@@ -@@ style li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ ies v@@ ol@@ un@@ tar@@ il@@ y n@@ o@@ w@@ ad@@ ay@@ s , or am I w@@ r@@ ong ?
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se , a sle@@ ep@@ y town outside the gates of Ro@@ t@@ ter@@ d@@ am , which barely mer@@ its a visit , is a special rec@@ or@@ d@@ -@@ h@@ ol@@ der .
The 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000-@@ re@@ si@@ dent m@@ un@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality has the lowest lit@@ er@@ acy rate in the whole of the Ne@@ th@@ er@@ lands .
In order to counter@@ act this as@@ in@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a con@@ tri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on towards general education and to rec@@ re@@ ate the seven fic@@ t@@ it@@ i@@ ou@@ s bri@@ d@@ g@@ es that fe@@ at@@ ure on the Euro notes as pretty , painted re@@ in@@ forced concrete m@@ in@@ i@@ at@@ u@@ res .
The success of the education off@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e was limited .
And so the city f@@ a@@ thers acknowledged that there was only one way to become m@@ a@@ ster over the statistics : a li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ y had to be built !
W@@ in@@ y Ma@@ as of the Ro@@ t@@ ter@@ d@@ am@@ -based ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tur@@ al firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V , m@@ a@@ ster of a@@ u@@ d@@ ac@@ ious bar char@@ ts and producer of h@@ um@@ or@@ ou@@ s and often c@@ yn@@ ical buildings , took the project on with his c@@ u@@ st@@ o@@ m@@ ar@@ y com@@ po@@ s@@ ure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five b@@ oo@@ ks under his arm and a g@@ r@@ in on his face .
And with the j@@ ud@@ ging panel still looking at him with be@@ w@@ il@@ der@@ ment , s@@ h@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ ging their sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s , the im@@ per@@ t@@ in@@ ent Ma@@ as st@@ ack@@ ed his chosen p@@ ro@@ ps by order of size to form a p@@ y@@ r@@ amid and rounded off his presentation - now su@@ it@@ ab@@ ly backed up with action - with the words : " De@@ ar M@@ un@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality ! "
So this is my suggestion for the Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se B@@ oo@@ k Mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in - for the so@@ -@@ called Bo@@ e@@ ken@@ berg !
N@@ ine years later , the 30-@@ m@@ illi@@ on-@@ euro mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in has been li@@ f@@ ted up .
It is part of a re@@ vit@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ation project , which also includes an underground car park , a super@@ market , a post office and a small number of adjacent a@@ p@@ art@@ ment buildings and ter@@ r@@ ac@@ ed h@@ ou@@ s@@ es , with a to@@ t@@ al of 50 d@@ w@@ ell@@ ings .
At the beginning of November , the B@@ ü@@ ch@@ er@@ berg was awarded second place in the " B@@ est Li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ y of NL 2012 " competition .
In addition , the project is also nominated for the D@@ ut@@ ch National W@@ ood A@@ ward 2012 .
Th@@ us , the f@@ ac@@ el@@ ess s@@ m@@ all-@@ town re@@ t@@ or@@ t , that until now had nothing more to offer than a po@@ st@@ -@@ modern pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an area and a st@@ un@@ n@@ ingly u@@ g@@ ly town h@@ all , behind whose white f@@ ac@@ ad@@ es one would expect to find a d@@ a@@ ir@@ y plant , has been bol@@ st@@ er@@ ed by a piece of con@@ temporary architecture .
First and fore@@ most , however , Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se now has its first public cultural building in the history of its e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence .
The long journey to the book
The first im@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on : the El@@ d@@ or@@ ado of b@@ oo@@ ks b@@ en@@ e@@ ath a ch@@ e@@ ese d@@ o@@ m@@ e .
There is in fact a lift that clim@@ bs through the centre of the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in massi@@ f , however , the tru@@ e jo@@ ys of sp@@ ace and lit@@ er@@ ature are revealed when sc@@ aling the t@@ op@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ y on foot .
The inter@@ i@@ or sp@@ ace , g@@ la@@ z@@ ed throughout , is bright and open , the fired c@@ l@@ in@@ ker floors and the el@@ e@@ g@@ an@@ t stre@@ et l@@ am@@ p@@ s speak the un@@ m@@ i@@ st@@ ak@@ able language of a public town square .
The urban am@@ b@@ i@@ ance is per@@ f@@ ec@@ t .
You are already on the loo@@ k@@ out for a park b@@ en@@ ch , a dog , and bo@@ ys and girls playing football .
And e@@ very@@ where there are b@@ oo@@ ks , b@@ oo@@ ks , b@@ oo@@ ks .
" Nor@@ m@@ ally book sh@@ el@@ ves run along the f@@ ac@@ a@@ de , and in the centre there is a large , dark sp@@ ace , which is usually un@@ p@@ le@@ as@@ ant and im@@ per@@ s@@ on@@ al , " says W@@ in@@ y Ma@@ as .
We turned the c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ cal sp@@ at@@ i@@ al con@@ f@@ ig@@ ur@@ ation on its head and turned the reading area inside out .
The inter@@ i@@ or of the B@@ ü@@ ch@@ er@@ berg is c@@ le@@ v@@ er@@ ly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ y , a ch@@ ess club , an environmental centre and the central te@@ ch@@ n@@ ical support room .
One particularly special fe@@ at@@ ure are the black book sh@@ el@@ ves , which si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously act as w@@ all cl@@ adding , par@@ a@@ p@@ ets and r@@ a@@ il@@ ings for the stair@@ way .
The appearance , feel and sc@@ ent are foreign .
Even di@@ e-@@ hard ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts and con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction eng@@ ine@@ ers s@@ ha@@ k@@ e their heads at the un@@ k@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ n con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction materials .
" Here we wanted to work with rec@@ y@@ cl@@ able materials , " e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed J@@ oo@@ p T@@ ro@@ u@@ b@@ or@@ s@@ t , Project Manager for the M@@ un@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality of Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se , on request of the Standard .
And th@@ us one day we st@@ umbled across a su@@ it@@ able waste product used in ag@@ ri@@ culture , on a F@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ ian far@@ m .
For many years , m@@ illi@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ re-@@ thick ar@@ ti@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c has been used in g@@ re@@ en@@ h@@ ou@@ s@@ es and fields in the Ne@@ th@@ er@@ lands as a base l@@ ay@@ er .
It is in@@ e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e and sa@@ ves time .
The th@@ in te@@ x@@ t@@ ile lasts for two seasons and is then di@@ sp@@ o@@ s@@ ed of as bul@@ k waste .
For the li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ y , the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into fo@@ ur@@ -@@ c@@ en@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ re-@@ thick bo@@ ar@@ ds .
Under heat and pressure , the so@@ -@@ called Land@@ b@@ ou@@ w pl@@ ast@@ ic ( K@@ L@@ P ) changes col@@ our to a dark , h@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ gen@@ e@@ ou@@ s and ro@@ b@@ us@@ t material , that s@@ m@@ ells like a m@@ i@@ x@@ t@@ ure of new car s@@ m@@ el@@ l and the s@@ m@@ el@@ l of tra@@ in@@ ers .
After 10@@ 5 steps you have re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed the summit .
At the end of the 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ m@@ e@@ ter@@ -@@ long journey , you are re@@ war@@ ded in the L@@ it@@ er@@ ature C@@ af@@ é , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with D@@ ut@@ ch c@@ ro@@ qu@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ es and po@@ t@@ ted fic@@ us trees .
These provide atmosphere , but most im@@ port@@ an@@ t@@ ly , re@@ g@@ ul@@ ate the air h@@ um@@ id@@ ity in the lit@@ er@@ ar@@ y mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in range .
D@@ on@@ ations for the new sou@@ l
" You would har@@ d@@ ly believe it , but this building , in sp@@ it@@ e of the many gl@@ ass p@@ an@@ els , is a show@@ case project in the area of ec@@ ology , " said T@@ ro@@ u@@ b@@ or@@ s@@ t .
It is h@@ e@@ ated and co@@ ol@@ ed us@@ ing g@@ e@@ o@@ th@@ er@@ m@@ al heat .
Although the B@@ ü@@ ch@@ er@@ berg has a gl@@ ass cover , the su@@ n only sh@@ ines only b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly into the inter@@ i@@ or , even on sun@@ n@@ y days .
The bro@@ ad , lam@@ in@@ ated wood g@@ lu@@ e be@@ am@@ s po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ed at ri@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ ang@@ l@@ es to the gl@@ ass f@@ ac@@ a@@ de , provide s@@ ha@@ de and ab@@ sor@@ b the majority of the sunlight .
The in@@ do@@ or te@@ m@@ per@@ ature is very p@@ le@@ as@@ ant .
The rest is taken care of by fully a@@ u@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c ro@@ l@@ ler b@@ l@@ in@@ ds .
S@@ te@@ f@@ an S@@ per@@ m@@ on , initially a sc@@ ep@@ tic of the IT sector , has already vent@@ ured into the new li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ y .
L@@ i@@ s@@ ette V@@ er@@ ha@@ i@@ g has also v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ed already .
So too has T@@ C@@ M@@ -@@ teacher , C@@ yn@@ th@@ ia B@@ o@@ g@@ ar@@ de , who even re@@ f@@ ers to the Bo@@ e@@ ken@@ berg as Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se 's " long over@@ due sou@@ l . "
The reason : At the in@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ ur@@ ation just a few weeks ago , every c@@ it@@ i@@ zen was invited to don@@ ate a book from his / her per@@ s@@ on@@ al collection .
This was , for the time being , to f@@ ill the op@@ tic@@ al g@@ a@@ p@@ s in the not yet fully st@@ o@@ ck@@ ed li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ y - currently there are 7@@ 0,000 items .
The conc@@ ep@@ t has been a success .
The sh@@ el@@ ves are full to capacity .
" N@@ o@@ thing is wor@@ se than a hal@@ f@@ -@@ em@@ p@@ ty li@@ b@@ r@@ ar@@ y , " said ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ t W@@ in@@ y Ma@@ as .
" I think that , th@@ an@@ ks to our in@@ v@@ itation , every re@@ si@@ dent now has a certain bond with this new building .
E@@ very@@ one knows that their book is part of the building .
Even if it 's just for de@@ c@@ or@@ ation .
As such , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have su@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ ded in m@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ ing the m@@ a@@ ster di@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ ine that specialist j@@ ar@@ g@@ on re@@ f@@ ers to as the f@@ or@@ m@@ ation of id@@ ent@@ ity .
Spi@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se has w@@ r@@ it@@ ten lit@@ er@@ ar@@ y history .
However young and un@@ e@@ du@@ c@@ ated it may be .
This is ultimately a starting point for id@@ ent@@ ity .
S@@ z@@ ab@@ o : " Germans must play a greater role "
In the vote on the inc@@ or@@ p@@ or@@ ation of Pal@@ e@@ st@@ ine , Germany ab@@ st@@ ain@@ ed from voting .
According to Stephen S@@ z@@ ab@@ o , Exper@@ t in US@@ -@@ European relations , in so doing B@@ er@@ lin is w@@ al@@ king a th@@ in di@@ pl@@ o@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c line .
De@@ ut@@ s@@ ch@@ e W@@ el@@ le : At the beginning of the week , Germany had initially si@@ gn@@ all@@ ed that it would vote against the Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans ' app@@ lic@@ ation for ob@@ server status within the United Nations .
However , B@@ er@@ lin sub@@ sequ@@ ent@@ ly ab@@ st@@ ain@@ ed from voting .
W@@ h@@ y ?
Stephen S@@ z@@ ab@@ o : Germany does not support what the I@@ s@@ r@@ a@@ el@@ is have done in G@@ a@@ z@@ a .
Now , however , due to their special rel@@ ation@@ ship with Israel , Germany must be cautious .
At the same time , however , I do not believe that it supports the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - al@@ b@@ e@@ i@@ t without being too c@@ r@@ it@@ ical of Israel .
During the u@@ p@@ rising in Libya in March 20@@ 11 , Germany li@@ ke@@ w@@ ise ab@@ st@@ ain@@ ed from voting , when it came to e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing a no-@@ fly zone .
This was ultimately implemented by NAT@@ O .
Do@@ es Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs ?
Yes , it does .
That is because it has just re@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ ised its foreign policy , in@@ de@@ ed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy .
This situation is aggravated by the fact that the E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans do not have a co@@ her@@ ent and stand@@ ar@@ di@@ s@@ ed policy .
The Germans th@@ us find themselves caught between two f@@ r@@ on@@ ts .
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not ac@@ c@@ u@@ st@@ omed to .
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en rou@@ te to a " more n@@ or@@ m@@ al " foreign policy .
A foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain .
So what specifically does a " n@@ or@@ m@@ al " foreign policy ent@@ a@@ il , from a German perspective ?
It shows a w@@ ill@@ in@@ g@@ n@@ ess to adopt po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or European par@@ t@@ ners .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by e@@ x@@ p@@ or@@ t and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Ne@@ ar East .
Germany 's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests .
Ha@@ v@@ e these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Ne@@ ar East con@@ fli@@ c@@ t and their voting in the U@@ N ?
On the one hand , Germany has major revenue m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets in the Ne@@ ar East , and particularly in the Gulf States .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ f@@ or@@ e it must be careful not to aff@@ r@@ on@@ t the public , but also the elite in the Arab@@ ic countries .
In any case , this plays a role .
However , I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't want to as@@ c@@ ri@@ be too much weight to this . This is not an en@@ ti@@ re@@ ly one-@@ sided rel@@ ation@@ ship .
N@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , it does play an important role in Germany 's con@@ si@@ der@@ ations .
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by ab@@ st@@ ain@@ ing to vote on important de@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on@@ s , such as the vote on Pal@@ e@@ st@@ ine ?
I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position pre@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ s .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ f@@ or@@ e I do not think that this was as dramatic a f@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ ure as was the case in the matters regarding Libya .
Per@@ ha@@ ps it will even e@@ ar@@ n Germany a certain degree of respect .
After all , it si@@ gn@@ als that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered .
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian in@@ it@@ i@@ ative .
The USA , on the other hand , have sp@@ o@@ ken out clearly in favour of a veto .
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European n@@ ations ?
D@@ ue to the American domestic policy , these differences have always e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ed .
I think that se@@ c@@ re@@ t@@ ly , the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation .
However , due to the political situation here , the government is naturally unable to voice this position p@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ly .
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so v@@ ast as they always appear .
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ j@@ ah@@ u , Obama is really not quite so en@@ th@@ used by N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ j@@ ah@@ u 's po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es .
Do@@ es Germany find it difficult to re@@ conc@@ ile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important par@@ t@@ ners in the EU on the other ?
I think that this is pre@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ ely what makes things so difficult for the Germans .
It would of course be a little si@@ m@@ pl@@ er for the Germans if there were a co@@ her@@ ent and stand@@ ar@@ di@@ s@@ ed European policy , which is currently not the case .
Th@@ us they are unable to be part of a wi@@ der authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
This is pre@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ ely what they are doing with the Euro .
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a stand@@ ar@@ di@@ s@@ ed European position .
This is , of course , no simple t@@ ask for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel .
This has always been a sen@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e subject .
Y@@ et I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role .
Do@@ es Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult ?
Germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be un@@ comfortable and , for obvious re@@ as@@ on@@ s , still fin@@ ds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
If we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany as@@ su@@ m@@ es a more prominent role , v@@ ar@@ ious anti-@@ German fe@@ el@@ ings become apparent .
This does not make matters simple for the Germans .
This is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unded by h@@ o@@ st@@ ile countries .
From this st@@ ance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA .
It must be recep@@ ti@@ v@@ e to the most diverse of n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ s and opinions , and this is not easy .
The influence of the USA over European politics is con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ally di@@ m@@ in@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vac@@ u@@ um , so who is f@@ illing the gap ?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
Even if they do not like it , even if it is un@@ comfortable and makes them even more un@@ popular - c '@@ est la v@@ ie !

N@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , it is en@@ jo@@ y@@ ing protection , provided the actual c@@ re@@ at@@ ors of the names do not su@@ e .
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights .
" It is becoming increasingly more difficult for fore@@ ign@@ ers to protect their brands in China , " said Thomas P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch , lawyer within the Taylor W@@ es@@ s@@ ing law firm , who spec@@ i@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ es in copyright infringement in the Far East .
Every week a new case lands on my des@@ k .
All the cop@@ y@@ c@@ ats re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e are a few additional letters in order that they can re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er their brands .
Th@@ us G@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ i simply becomes L@@ u@@ -@@ G@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ i , Pra@@ d@@ a@@ -@@ K@@ n@@ y is registered in place of Pra@@ d@@ a .
German companies are also ' le@@ g@@ ally ' cop@@ ied in this man@@ ner , such as man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er of sp@@ or@@ ting app@@ are@@ l , P@@ uma .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch opens a f@@ ile con@@ ta@@ in@@ ing re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ations with the tra@@ de@@ mark office in Pe@@ king .
On 14 September 20@@ 10 a Chinese company cop@@ y@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted the brand name Z@@ e@@ gn@@ a D@@ F P@@ uma there , an al@@ i@@ as that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer E@@ r@@ men@@ eg@@ il@@ do Z@@ e@@ gn@@ a .
The fact that the Chinese are world ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s in cop@@ y@@ ing and in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ing on intellectual property is w@@ ell@@ -@@ known .
In the major cities there are mul@@ ti@@ -@@ level department stores that sell counter@@ f@@ e@@ i@@ t g@@ oo@@ ds almost e@@ x@@ c@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ ely .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the tra@@ de@@ mark office , fully officially , which is already p@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ ted elsewhere .
The Chinese call this " Ban@@ g M@@ in@@ g@@ p@@ a@@ i , " a p@@ as@@ sen@@ ger brand .
The word is based on " Ban@@ g D@@ ak@@ u@@ an . "
This re@@ f@@ ers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men .
The Chinese authorities are un@@ aw@@ are of any w@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ doing .
" This har@@ ms business and we must fight against it , " challenges P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
" The brand is w@@ at@@ ered down , its uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess disap@@ pe@@ ars - the image damage is enormous . "
The financial losses and process costs of the affected b@@ r@@ an@@ ches amount into the millions , especially in the case of e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e flagship products .
According to information from market research company C@@ L@@ S@@ A , with a volume of 15 billion e@@ u@@ ro@@ s annually , China is the third largest market for lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y items , and the f@@ ast@@ est growing .
However , the d@@ el@@ e@@ ti@@ on of du@@ b@@ ious ent@@ ries in the tra@@ de@@ mark re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ ry are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty p@@ en@@ n@@ y .
The process can last for up to nine years , with an un@@ certain outcome .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch reports of in@@ st@@ ances w@@ h@@ er@@ e@@ by the court di@@ s@@ mis@@ s@@ es cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ti@@ on is being raised has become a " market reality . "
If the com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ant is un@@ lucky , he may even have to pay the pl@@ ag@@ i@@ ar@@ ist money for having in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ ed on his tra@@ de@@ mark in China , said P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
Sometimes the law of the j@@ ung@@ le pre@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ s here .
F@@ am@@ ou@@ s cases also rel@@ ate to g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ ic el@@ em@@ ent@@ s .
In 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 , Da@@ im@@ ler lost a legal battle with the con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction m@@ a@@ ch@@ in@@ er@@ y man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete p@@ um@@ p man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er P@@ ut@@ z@@ m@@ e@@ i@@ ster .
Even today , the Chinese company is therefore per@@ mit@@ ted to use an em@@ ble@@ m that re@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ es the Mercedes star .
V@@ ol@@ vo@@ -@@ pur@@ ch@@ as@@ er Ge@@ ely or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally used a blue and white lo@@ go that re@@ se@@ mbled the B@@ M@@ W lo@@ go ; the disp@@ ute was ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ated and Ge@@ ely was forced to change it .
F@@ ash@@ ion h@@ ou@@ se L@@ ac@@ o@@ st@@ e lost a su@@ it in China against cop@@ y@@ c@@ ats from H@@ ong K@@ ong and Singapore , who were us@@ ing the fam@@ ou@@ s c@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le looking in the other direction .
The Chinese authorities are un@@ aw@@ are of any w@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ doing .
The C@@ T@@ M@@ O tra@@ de@@ mark office in Pe@@ king does ack@@ n@@ o@@ wle@@ dge that there were bott@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ ks in 20@@ 10 due to limited st@@ aff@@ ing and equipment .
In the past year , however , things re@@ p@@ or@@ te@@ d@@ ly " re@@ turned to n@@ or@@ m@@ al following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . "
Th@@ us the stock of un@@ p@@ ro@@ c@@ essed a@@ p@@ pe@@ al p@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ ings was reduced by 22 percent .
Al@@ most 5@@ 7@@ ,000 such c@@ ased were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year .
N@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , there are still 8@@ 1,500 appeals waiting to be re@@ sol@@ v@@ ed in the office .
To re@@ m@@ e@@ dy this is very e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e
As is so often the case in China , the figures are im@@ po@@ s@@ ing .
In the past year , more than 1.@@ 4 million applications for tra@@ de@@ mark protection were sub@@ mit@@ ted to the C@@ T@@ M@@ O , almost one third more than in 20@@ 10 .
This is a record and m@@ e@@ ans that China , for the t@@ ent@@ h time in su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ on , is the global leader when it comes to new tra@@ de@@ mark applications , in@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ed the authority .
The same app@@ li@@ es for the in@@ v@@ ent@@ or@@ y of v@@ al@@ id tra@@ de@@ m@@ ar@@ k@@ s , to@@ t@@ all@@ ing 5.@@ 5 million in number .
In 20@@ 11 , 1.@@ 8 billion yuan in fees were received .
P@@ u@@ t simply , this m@@ e@@ ans that each app@@ lic@@ ation costs on average 1,@@ 2@@ 80 yuan , or 160 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s .
To a@@ p@@ pe@@ al against an app@@ lic@@ ation costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg .
For more than seven years , the group has been con@@ testing against a Chinese pl@@ ag@@ i@@ ar@@ ist .
The Germans did in fact man@@ age to e@@ x@@ po@@ se the company 's illegal manufacturing of cop@@ ied mo@@ tor vehicle parts .
However , the cop@@ y@@ c@@ at still se@@ c@@ ured the Chinese rights to the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg brand .
This is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be p@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ ted in Germany , said H@@ ann@@ o W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg Ch@@ em@@ ical Sp@@ ec@@ i@@ al@@ it@@ i@@ es in M@@ un@@ i@@ ch .
The C@@ T@@ M@@ O tra@@ de@@ mark office then also dismissed the M@@ un@@ ich@@ -based company 's a@@ p@@ pe@@ al .
In the next two in@@ st@@ ances , Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg was p@@ ro@@ v@@ en right , however the op@@ po@@ s@@ ing party continues to con@@ t@@ est the matter to this day .
You have to pay extremely careful attention .
The matter is now p@@ en@@ ding before the Supreme Court .
W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e conclusion and p@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ es the p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ alism of the courts .
However , he also says : " The process is extremely e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e and takes a lot of time , money and ner@@ ves . "
The internal costs can barely be c@@ al@@ c@@ ul@@ ated , the company ar@@ chi@@ v@@ e even had to look through c@@ ent@@ ur@@ y-@@ old records in order to provide p@@ ro@@ of .
F@@ i@@ v@@ e years ago Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg un@@ successfully offered the op@@ po@@ s@@ ing party a " high six-@@ figure su@@ m in e@@ u@@ ro@@ s " as se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment .
" This shows how much this is worth to us , " says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
The d@@ ang@@ ers in the Far East even threaten to sp@@ illing over , back into Europe .
P@@ ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly if im@@ it@@ at@@ ors secure un@@ p@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ ted brand names there .
For example , a Chinese man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er wanted to re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er the Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg la@@ be@@ l for shoes and le@@ a@@ th@@ er in Germany .
This is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess managed to prevent the re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation .
" You have to pay extremely careful attention , " says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
Both he and P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China .
It is not su@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ent to re@@ ly on international tra@@ de@@ mark rights , rather fore@@ ign@@ ers should also re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er " everything " that is in any way wor@@ th@@ y of protection in China as well , " said W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
O@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise costs can be much more e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e than the re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation fe@@ e .
In actual fact : if Fre@@ u@@ den@@ berg were to loo@@ se at the final h@@ ur@@ d@@ le of its tra@@ de@@ mark drama , they would probably have to pay the op@@ po@@ s@@ ing party license fees for the use of their own name , e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
Or al@@ ter@@ n@@ at@@ i@@ v@@ ely we would be forced out of the market in the re@@ spec@@ ti@@ v@@ e sector .
World AIDS day : St@@ o@@ m@@ p , sing , help
In H@@ e@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ berg , the Im@@ b@@ on@@ g@@ i ch@@ o@@ ir is re@@ h@@ e@@ ar@@ sing - and in the S@@ w@@ a@@ z@@ il@@ and , AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans are d@@ el@@ ig@@ h@@ ted .
The history of a link that over@@ comes far more than a distance of 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 33 k@@ il@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res .
First of all , the st@@ am@@ p@@ ing : co@@ w@@ boy b@@ oo@@ ts , basketball shoes , la@@ dies ' p@@ um@@ ps and men 's lo@@ af@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the par@@ qu@@ et flo@@ or , and quickly do just that .
One-@@ two-@@ th@@ re@@ e-@@ four .
Only then do the vo@@ i@@ c@@ es of the s@@ in@@ g@@ ers s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly s@@ well - al@@ to , b@@ ass , ten@@ or and s@@ op@@ r@@ an@@ o surge , be@@ g@@ u@@ ile and ha@@ unt .
And F@@ i@@ e@@ te H@@ op@@ f , the 29@@ -year-old con@@ du@@ c@@ tor , almost r@@ i@@ s@@ es up out of his shoes as he brings the en@@ se@@ m@@ ble together with his s@@ m@@ oo@@ th , yet wild g@@ e@@ st@@ u@@ res .
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ology in H@@ e@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ berg the Im@@ b@@ on@@ g@@ i C@@ h@@ o@@ ir are p@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ ing a new song .
The fi@@ f@@ te@@ en s@@ in@@ g@@ ers , ag@@ ing from 23 to 6@@ 9 years old , range from human gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ists to the m@@ a@@ in@@ ten@@ ance man .
" O@@ m '@@ O@@ b@@ ani " is by no m@@ e@@ ans a simple piece , with each voice having a different te@@ x@@ t , and in an extremely foreign language at that : Z@@ ul@@ u , which is sp@@ o@@ ken by el@@ even million people in South Africa , Bo@@ t@@ s@@ w@@ an@@ a , L@@ es@@ o@@ th@@ o , Mal@@ aw@@ i , Mo@@ z@@ am@@ b@@ i@@ que and in parts of S@@ w@@ a@@ z@@ il@@ and .
H@@ el@@ p@@ ing others to help themselves
There are around 3@@ 4 million people in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted with HI@@ V around the world , as according to the e@@ st@@ im@@ ations of Un@@ ai@@ ds , the United Nations ' programme to battle AIDS .
Of these , 2@@ 3@@ .@@ 5 million live in South Africa .
In S@@ w@@ a@@ z@@ il@@ and , there are 2@@ 4@@ 5,000 AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans .
Me@@ an@@ while , more than 40 percent of the population are HI@@ V po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e .
The V@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ es for Africa Association has found sp@@ on@@ s@@ ors in Germany for 180 AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans in the village of E@@ s@@ it@@ j@@ en@@ i .
70 of these attend a se@@ con@@ d@@ ar@@ y school .
For 15 or 20 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s per month , you can become a sp@@ on@@ s@@ or .
This g@@ u@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es the child money for school , a school uni@@ form and a warm meal each day in the G@@ o@@ g@@ o C@@ ent@@ re .
In Z@@ ul@@ u , Im@@ b@@ on@@ g@@ i m@@ e@@ ans st@@ or@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ er or wor@@ sh@@ i@@ pper .
In this region , no-@@ one can speak the B@@ an@@ t@@ u language f@@ lu@@ ent@@ ly , but they can sing it .
For almost ten years the ch@@ o@@ ir has been p@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ ing songs in this foreign , ' so@@ f@@ t ' language , and now and then they bring them back to where they or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally came from : the South of Africa .
For an 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3-@@ k@@ il@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ re flight away from H@@ e@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ berg , in the north west of the S@@ w@@ a@@ z@@ il@@ and Kingdom , li@@ es the village of E@@ s@@ it@@ j@@ en@@ i , which re@@ li@@ es on the vo@@ cal power of the German ch@@ o@@ ir .
For@@ ty percent are in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted .
A@@ round 2,000 people live there , some still in simple m@@ u@@ d and stra@@ w h@@ ut@@ s , and the majority of them are children .
More than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they su@@ c@@ c@@ um@@ bed to the HI@@ V v@@ ir@@ us .
In E@@ s@@ it@@ j@@ en@@ i you get a small fo@@ re@@ s@@ ha@@ do@@ w of the illness from which all of S@@ w@@ a@@ z@@ il@@ and is su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing : according to Un@@ i@@ c@@ e@@ f , the region has the highest HI@@ V infection rates and the lowest life e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ tan@@ cy in the world .
C@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ ion , which has been p@@ ro@@ v@@ en to reduce the risk of contracting the v@@ ir@@ us by half , is barely p@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ ised by the population .
More than f@@ or@@ ty percent of people in the S@@ w@@ a@@ z@@ il@@ and carry the im@@ m@@ un@@ o@@ def@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ cy v@@ ir@@ us , and d@@ y@@ ing in you mid-@@ th@@ ir@@ ties is by no m@@ e@@ ans rare .
On a group trip to Africa in early 2005 , the C@@ h@@ o@@ ir v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ed the village , but first and fore@@ most , the Im@@ b@@ on@@ g@@ is saw many children on the streets , l@@ ac@@ king not only in par@@ ent@@ al care but in p@@ r@@ ac@@ tic@@ ally everything else as well : food , c@@ lo@@ thing , education .
Without a school leaving c@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate , there are barely any op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es , particularly in a poor country .
In@@ it@@ i@@ ally it was the private com@@ mit@@ ment of in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als to send a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few e@@ u@@ ro@@ s per year .
However , just one year later , the ch@@ o@@ ir established the " V@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ es for Africa " Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS or@@ ph@@ ans in E@@ s@@ it@@ j@@ en@@ i at an almost professional level .
Fac@@ ts on se@@ x@@ u@@ ally trans@@ mit@@ ted in@@ f@@ ections .
What are the most important se@@ x@@ u@@ ally trans@@ mit@@ ted di@@ se@@ as@@ es ?
B@@ ac@@ ter@@ ial ST@@ Is include sy@@ ph@@ ili@@ s , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia and g@@ on@@ or@@ r@@ h@@ o@@ e@@ a .
Com@@ m@@ on v@@ ir@@ al ST@@ Is are HI@@ V , human p@@ a@@ p@@ ill@@ oma v@@ ir@@ us@@ es , her@@ p@@ es gen@@ it@@ al@@ is and h@@ e@@ p@@ at@@ it@@ is .
Cr@@ ab@@ s and sc@@ ab@@ ies b@@ el@@ ong among the par@@ as@@ it@@ i@@ c ST@@ Is .
Who are the main affected groups ?
Sy@@ ph@@ ili@@ s and g@@ on@@ or@@ r@@ h@@ o@@ e@@ a o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r primarily in men that have inter@@ course with other men .
The Robert Ko@@ ch Institute un@@ der@@ stands that at least four in five of all sy@@ ph@@ ili@@ s cases reported in Germany are trans@@ mit@@ ted by m@@ e@@ ans of se@@ x@@ ual con@@ t@@ act between men .
Among h@@ e@@ ter@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ ual ad@@ ul@@ ts , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia in@@ f@@ ections , tri@@ ch@@ o@@ m@@ on@@ i@@ a@@ si@@ s , can@@ di@@ di@@ a@@ si@@ s ( f@@ ung@@ al ) , g@@ on@@ or@@ r@@ h@@ o@@ e@@ a and human p@@ a@@ p@@ ill@@ oma v@@ ir@@ us@@ es are fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly o@@ c@@ cur@@ r@@ ing se@@ x@@ u@@ ally trans@@ mit@@ ted di@@ se@@ as@@ es .
The sp@@ re@@ ad of HI@@ V among h@@ e@@ ter@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ ual ad@@ ul@@ ts in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly con@@ tr@@ acted cases of HI@@ V are found in this group .
Among young people , ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia in@@ f@@ ections are much more common than in other population groups .
According to European s@@ ur@@ ve@@ ys , three quarters of all in@@ f@@ ections affect young people between the ag@@ es of 15 and 25 .
In this country , human p@@ a@@ p@@ ill@@ oma v@@ ir@@ us@@ es are also fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly found in young people .
How has the number of in@@ f@@ ections developed ?
Not all se@@ x@@ u@@ ally trans@@ mit@@ ted di@@ se@@ as@@ es are n@@ o@@ ti@@ fi@@ able .
According to the Robert Ko@@ ch Institute , the number of sy@@ ph@@ ili@@ s in@@ f@@ ections has more than doubled from 1,6@@ 9@@ 7 cases in 2001 , to 3@@ ,@@ 6@@ 9@@ 8 cases in 20@@ 11 .
The number of newly con@@ tr@@ acted cases of HI@@ V has been on the decline since 2007 .
In 20@@ 11 there were around 2@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 cases .
This is around one t@@ ent@@ h fewer than the previous year .
Which sy@@ mp@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ s in@@ di@@ c@@ ate a se@@ x@@ u@@ ally trans@@ mit@@ ted disease ?
The in@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ ou@@ s di@@ se@@ as@@ es can cause ul@@ c@@ ers in the gen@@ it@@ al area , di@@ s@@ com@@ f@@ or@@ t when ur@@ in@@ ating , di@@ s@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge , lower ab@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ al pain and b@@ li@@ st@@ ers or war@@ ts .
However , often they cause no pain or any other sy@@ mp@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ s , th@@ us remaining un@@ de@@ te@@ c@@ ted .
How can you protect yo@@ ur@@ self ?
Con@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s can reduce the risk of con@@ tr@@ action , however , they do not offer 100 % protection .
This is because o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ onally , the p@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ gen@@ s of se@@ x@@ u@@ ally trans@@ mit@@ ted di@@ se@@ as@@ es can also be passed on vi@@ a s@@ m@@ e@@ ar in@@ f@@ ections and close bo@@ di@@ ly con@@ t@@ act .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ f@@ or@@ e , first and fore@@ most experts re@@ commend that people with fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly ch@@ ang@@ ing se@@ x@@ ual par@@ t@@ ners un@@ der@@ go regular e@@ x@@ am@@ in@@ ations .
If di@@ ag@@ n@@ o@@ s@@ ed early , the majority of ST@@ Is can be c@@ ured and long-term con@@ sequ@@ en@@ ces avo@@ i@@ ded .
Through sp@@ on@@ s@@ or@@ ships don@@ ations and by no m@@ e@@ ans least the funds that the ch@@ o@@ ir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .
" In to@@ t@@ al , we have already sent around 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s to E@@ s@@ it@@ j@@ en@@ i , " said An@@ net@@ te L@@ en@@ n@@ ar@@ tz , Cha@@ ir@@ person of the association .
In the village itself , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ in@@ i , a self-@@ as@@ su@@ red and as@@ s@@ er@@ ti@@ v@@ e woman , man@@ ag@@ es the money from Germany .
She makes sure that the or@@ ph@@ ans have good ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation , for example with one of their g@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ mothers .
The Go@@ go@@ s , as the old la@@ dies are called in Z@@ ul@@ u , are the p@@ ill@@ ars of the village .
Some of them have up to 14 or@@ ph@@ ans living with them , p@@ ro@@ vi@@ ding them with a ro@@ of over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school cl@@ as@@ s@@ es pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ally every day , in their school uni@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ s .
An@@ y@@ one who doesn 't have anyone left , ar@@ ri@@ ves at the sh@@ el@@ ter with K@@ h@@ an@@ y@@ i@@ s@@ ile , a single woman who e@@ ar@@ n@@ s the same sal@@ ar@@ y from the association as the two co@@ o@@ ks who co@@ o@@ k for more than 200 h@@ ung@@ ry children every day .
In addition , " V@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ es for Africa " has established a se@@ wing school , built two chicken co@@ ops and , together with the American health or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation , P@@ S@@ I , or@@ g@@ an@@ ised for many in the village to be tested for HI@@ V .
This is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the en@@ ti@@ re country , the best way of keeping things under w@@ r@@ a@@ ps is if people are dead .
A king with 14 wives
" AIDS is an ab@@ sol@@ ute t@@ abo@@ o subject , " said An@@ net@@ te L@@ en@@ n@@ ar@@ tz , " because it is associated with se@@ x@@ u@@ ality . "
This is actually st@@ range for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives .
The last ab@@ sol@@ ute monarch of sub@@ -S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Africa , King M@@ s@@ w@@ ati III . , is known for his e@@ x@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ v@@ e lifestyle .
Pol@@ y@@ gam@@ y in place of de@@ mo@@ cr@@ acy .
Among other factors , the fact that the HI@@ V v@@ ir@@ us has sp@@ re@@ ad quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially s@@ anc@@ ti@@ on@@ ed lifestyle .
Another factor is the large number of mig@@ rant workers who carry the v@@ ir@@ us across the country .
There are free con@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s on every cor@@ ner , said An@@ net@@ te L@@ en@@ n@@ ar@@ tz , " but they are har@@ d@@ ly used .
The culture pre@@ sc@@ ri@@ b@@ es otherwise - f@@ l@@ esh to f@@ l@@ esh . "
In order to p@@ ro@@ mo@@ te the cultural exchange , the Im@@ b@@ on@@ g@@ i ch@@ o@@ ir tra@@ v@@ el@@ s through Southern Africa every two or three years and s@@ ings songs of mel@@ an@@ ch@@ ol@@ y , fighting spirit , confidence and black self-@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ e@@ m , which many from the southern ti@@ p of the black con@@ t@@ in@@ ent still know from the times of a@@ p@@ ar@@ th@@ e@@ i@@ d .
A b@@ us full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy , but some g@@ ri@@ m@@ -@@ faced border soldiers even sh@@ ed a few te@@ ars .
The journey always le@@ ads to E@@ s@@ it@@ j@@ en@@ i , where the s@@ in@@ g@@ ers visit their sp@@ on@@ s@@ or children .
Even though you can barely find the small village on a m@@ a@@ p , it is more than w@@ ell@@ -@@ known in the v@@ al@@ le@@ y of the E@@ z@@ ul@@ w@@ en@@ i Ri@@ ver .
" Go to E@@ s@@ it@@ j@@ en@@ i , that 's where the light is , " say the people there .
And if you make the 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 3@@ 3-@@ k@@ il@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ re flight back to H@@ e@@ i@@ d@@ el@@ berg , to visit the st@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ ing s@@ in@@ g@@ ers in their re@@ h@@ e@@ ar@@ s@@ al room , you 'll see that the light is there too .
Messen@@ ger : N@@ AS@@ A di@@ s@@ co@@ v@@ er@@ s i@@ c@@ e on Mercury
The Messen@@ ger probe has found evidence of i@@ c@@ e on the pl@@ an@@ et Mercury .
It is th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t that the i@@ c@@ e cover may be up to 20 m@@ e@@ t@@ res thick .
The US sp@@ ace agency , N@@ AS@@ A , has p@@ ro@@ v@@ en the e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence of i@@ c@@ e on the pl@@ an@@ et Mercury .
Although the pl@@ an@@ et li@@ es closest to the su@@ n , it does have f@@ ro@@ zen water - as sh@@ own in three st@@ u@@ dies published on Thursday in specialist magazine " Science . "
The Messen@@ ger probe has found evidence that there is an i@@ c@@ e cover in the region of the pl@@ an@@ et that li@@ es per@@ man@@ ent@@ ly in s@@ ha@@ do@@ w .
This is th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to be at east 30 c@@ en@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ res and perhaps up to 20 m@@ e@@ t@@ res thick .
The water pre@@ su@@ m@@ ab@@ ly came from com@@ ets or perhaps also ast@@ ero@@ ids that im@@ p@@ acted with Mercury .
However , no-@@ one is linking the discovery of i@@ c@@ e with the e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence of life on the pl@@ an@@ et , said Chief Sci@@ entist for the Messen@@ ger probe , S@@ e@@ an Sol@@ o@@ m@@ on .
The te@@ m@@ per@@ ature on Mercury can reach up to 4@@ 26 de@@ g@@ re@@ es C@@ el@@ si@@ us .
That said , the fin@@ d@@ ings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed other regions of the sol@@ ar system .

Since then , the m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors in op@@ tic@@ al tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts that they provide increasingly p@@ ro@@ found .

O@@ p@@ en to inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation , like so much in the dra@@ f@@ t sub@@ mit@@ ted by M@@ ur@@ s@@ i to be signed and that , in his own words , will be sub@@ mit@@ ted to E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ ti@@ ans for referendum " very soon . "
" The re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on is back "
For weeks the opposition has been g@@ a@@ th@@ er@@ ing to com@@ b@@ at the su@@ per@@ i@@ or strength of the I@@ s@@ lam@@ ists .
T@@ ens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square in Cairo , in un@@ fam@@ ili@@ ar un@@ ity , and pledged to bring down the char@@ ter before it has even come into effect .
" The re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on is back and we are going to be v@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ ious , " said Ham@@ d@@ in S@@ ab@@ b@@ ah@@ i , third place candidate in the presidential elections .
Nob@@ le Peace Prize win@@ ner and former H@@ e@@ ad of the International Atomic Energy Au@@ th@@ ority , M@@ oh@@ amed El@@ -@@ Bar@@ a@@ de@@ i e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed that the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional dra@@ f@@ t b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ s " on the rub@@ bish ti@@ p of history . "
V@@ ia S@@ MS service T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , he accused M@@ ur@@ s@@ i 's fol@@ lo@@ wers of w@@ an@@ ting to lead " a c@@ ou@@ p against de@@ mo@@ cr@@ acy . "
" If he calls for the referendum , we will go to his palace and over@@ throw him , " said member of the opposition J@@ as@@ s@@ er Said .
" We have not yet gro@@ w@@ n tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been at@@ on@@ ed for , " st@@ ated the Egyptian media , qu@@ o@@ ting opposition politician Ch@@ al@@ ed Ali .
And several j@@ ud@@ g@@ es have si@@ gn@@ all@@ ed that they do not want to oversee the referendum , which would ren@@ der it in@@ v@@ al@@ id .
" The Kor@@ an is our constitution "
The w@@ ell@@ -@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ ised Muslim B@@ ro@@ th@@ er@@ hood gathered for a co@@ un@@ ter@@ -@@ de@@ m@@ on@@ str@@ ation , although ac@@ ting c@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ously they did not choose the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square but rather a m@@ ass prayer on the other side of the N@@ ile , outside the Cairo University .
Many ve@@ il@@ ed women and fol@@ lo@@ wers of the S@@ al@@ af@@ is took part , shouting out : " The people demand the app@@ lic@@ ation of Go@@ d 's law . "
They de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ed of M@@ ur@@ s@@ i : " C@@ le@@ an@@ se the country ! " and p@@ ro@@ te@@ sted : " The Kor@@ an is our constitution . "
A st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ le for control over the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ c T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r Square , where everything began , would have most likely provoked events v@@ er@@ ging on civil war .
Q@@ u@@ it@@ e clearly , this was something that M@@ ur@@ s@@ i 's fol@@ lo@@ wers did not want to risk .
The Muslim Brothers st@@ ated that both those against and those in favour of the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional dra@@ f@@ t had expressed themselves l@@ oud and clear .
Now is the time to let the population decide at the bal@@ lot bo@@ x , in which direction the country should move forward .
It is a c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty that there is a majority in favour of the I@@ s@@ lam@@ ists ' dra@@ f@@ t .
" The term ' human rights ' does not even appear once "
H@@ af@@ e@@ z Ab@@ u S@@ a@@ e@@ d@@ a is fur@@ ious about this forced con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ v@@ e process , which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups .
The 48@@ -year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation for Human Rights ( E@@ O@@ HR ) def@@ ended the Muslim B@@ ro@@ th@@ er@@ hood , when im@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ ed or in court under M@@ u@@ b@@ ar@@ ak .
Not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are in@@ di@@ visible .
For this he was b@@ at@@ ter@@ ed , condemned and im@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ ed .
" And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , " he be@@ mo@@ an@@ ed in a discussion with " W@@ el@@ t am S@@ on@@ n@@ tag . "
The lawyer has re@@ signed himself to M@@ ur@@ s@@ i e@@ x@@ ten@@ ding his power to all three b@@ r@@ an@@ ches of state government .
These measures are b@@ lat@@ ant bre@@ a@@ ch@@ es of the ground r@@ ul@@ es of de@@ mo@@ cr@@ acy and will g@@ u@@ i@@ de Egypt into a new di@@ c@@ t@@ at@@ or@@ ship .
" In@@ st@@ e@@ ad of str@@ eng@@ th@@ en@@ ing the civil society , the President is eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely s@@ us@@ p@@ en@@ ding it , " complained S@@ a@@ e@@ d@@ a .
Y@@ et without civil society or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ations , a de@@ mo@@ cr@@ acy cannot function .
S@@ a@@ e@@ d@@ a fe@@ els ab@@ an@@ d@@ on@@ ed , even by the international community , which is ob@@ serving the battle over the i@@ de@@ ological direction on the N@@ ile with a m@@ i@@ x@@ t@@ ure of cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity and excitement .
This could come back to ha@@ unt them .
One de@@ m@@ on@@ str@@ ator at the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r warned : " You are le@@ t@@ ting loo@@ se a m@@ on@@ ster that you can no longer control . "
Nor@@ way 's r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k : Is this the world 's s@@ m@@ el@@ li@@ est fish ?
Nor@@ way 's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
C@@ ou@@ l@@ d the secret of the country 's success be con@@ ne@@ c@@ ted to the local app@@ e@@ t@@ it@@ e for some e@@ x@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ ingly s@@ m@@ el@@ ly fish ?
Take a selection of over@@ -@@ ri@@ p@@ e ch@@ e@@ es@@ es .
Place them in the mid@@ s@@ t of a p@@ ile of dirty , w@@ e@@ t soccer k@@ it .
Le@@ a@@ v@@ e for a week .
Now you have the n@@ o@@ se@@ -@@ n@@ um@@ b@@ ing s@@ m@@ el@@ l of r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k , one of the great Nor@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ an d@@ el@@ i@@ c@@ ac@@ ies .
I am in the small town of F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es , about three hours from O@@ sl@@ o .
There is snow , spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar sc@@ en@@ er@@ y - and that od@@ our , ever present , h@@ ang@@ s in the air .
R@@ ak@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k is tro@@ u@@ t sp@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ l@@ ed with salt and fer@@ mented in water for - de@@ p@@ en@@ ding on how s@@ m@@ el@@ ly you like your fish - up to a year .
As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , Nor@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ans flo@@ ck to a f@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ v@@ al here in F@@ ag@@ ern@@ es de@@ vo@@ ted to this most , well , c@@ a@@ p@@ tiv@@ ating of foods .
" You e@@ at it r@@ a@@ w , and then s@@ w@@ al@@ low a gl@@ ass of a@@ qu@@ av@@ it , " says H@@ av@@ ar@@ d H@@ al@@ v@@ ar@@ sen , full-@@ time local firefighter but also the so@@ -@@ called " R@@ ak@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k General , " in charge of running the f@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ v@@ al .
All around us people are e@@ ating little c@@ u@@ b@@ es of the fish and k@@ n@@ o@@ ck@@ ing back quantities of drink .
" Some people like the a@@ qu@@ av@@ it more than the r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k , " says H@@ av@@ ar@@ d .
The drink can kill the s@@ m@@ el@@ l .
I try a few p@@ i@@ e@@ ces .
If you can avo@@ id passing it under your n@@ o@@ se , it is not bad - not un@@ like a slice of s@@ us@@ hi that has been on rather a long b@@ us journey .
R@@ ak@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k is a product of very different , po@@ v@@ er@@ t@@ y-@@ stri@@ ck@@ en times in Nor@@ way when , pre@@ -@@ re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation , fish was so@@ aked in a@@ ir@@ ti@@ g@@ h@@ t barrels of water and salt in a@@ u@@ t@@ um@@ n .
Th@@ en in the de@@ p@@ ths of winter , well and truly fer@@ mented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the sen@@ s@@ es k@@ n@@ o@@ ck@@ ed out by alcohol - e@@ at@@ en .
Only a generation ago , thousands of Nor@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , em@@ ig@@ rating mainly to the US .
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , at@@ trac@@ ted by pl@@ en@@ ti@@ ful jobs , high w@@ ag@@ es and a comprehensive care system .
People from S@@ w@@ e@@ d@@ en , the old rival and not so long ago far ri@@ cher than Nor@@ way , stream in to work .
R@@ ak@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k is seen as si@@ gn@@ i@@ f@@ y@@ ing something important , a v@@ it@@ al if rather s@@ m@@ el@@ ly part of Nor@@ way 's past .
It is among the more e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e di@@ sh@@ es you can buy .
But then everything is e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e - a small gl@@ ass of be@@ er or a sandwich k@@ n@@ o@@ ck you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
Nor@@ way does not often make it on to the global news ag@@ en@@ d@@ a - and most seem to like it that way .
People here are still lo@@ ath to men@@ ti@@ on by name An@@ der@@ s Brei@@ vi@@ k , the ri@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ wing , r@@ ac@@ ist e@@ x@@ tre@@ m@@ ist who g@@ un@@ ned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
In@@ st@@ e@@ ad , the shootings are re@@ fer@@ red to as " the July the 2@@ 2@@ n@@ d incident . "
Nor@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their pe@@ ac@@ e-@@ lo@@ ving country one of their own was c@@ a@@ p@@ able of such brut@@ ality and murder .
The growth since the early 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 0@@ s of one of the world 's biggest oil and gas in@@ du@@ stri@@ es li@@ es behind much of Nor@@ way 's pre@@ s@@ ent@@ -@@ day wealth .
" But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , " says Anna our wa@@ it@@ re@@ s@@ s , handing round tra@@ ys of m@@ at@@ uring r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k and , with her long b@@ l@@ on@@ d hair and star@@ t@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nor@@ di@@ c w@@ ell@@ -@@ being .
We are a - how you say - p@@ ru@@ dent people .
Her English , like that of most people here , is f@@ law@@ less .
We are not very show@@ y , we do not like o@@ st@@ ent@@ ation .
Nor@@ way has h@@ an@@ d@@ led its oil wealth very c@@ are@@ fully - all but a small per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of money from the industry is invested in a special f@@ un@@ d for the benefit of future gen@@ er@@ ations .
When everyone else was throwing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Nor@@ way kept its pur@@ se str@@ ings ti@@ gh@@ t@@ ly bo@@ un@@ d .
" As long as we can sk@@ i in winter and go hi@@ king in su@@ m@@ m@@ er we are happy , " says Anna .
" And e@@ at r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k , " she adds with a c@@ are@@ free l@@ a@@ u@@ gh .
I st@@ and in the snow and queue for something to e@@ at - I have had enough r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k .
Now an el@@ k bur@@ ger is certainly something different and rather su@@ c@@ c@@ ul@@ ent to the ta@@ st@@ e .
But in the evening , it is more of that s@@ m@@ el@@ ly fish .
The hotel I am st@@ ay@@ ing in is one of a number of ven@@ ues h@@ o@@ st@@ ing a r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k d@@ in@@ ner where g@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ s vote on the best - or perhaps the most nas@@ ally ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing - fish .
There is a live TV link up to a com@@ per@@ e in a bo@@ w ti@@ e s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unded by pl@@ at@@ es of r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k .
It is like the E@@ u@@ ro@@ vision song con@@ t@@ est .
" What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Th@@ or-@@ Ju@@ er@@ gen ? "
" Here are our points , H@@ av@@ ar@@ d . "
There is cl@@ apping , l@@ a@@ u@@ gh@@ ter .
A man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with a@@ qu@@ av@@ it .

Mexico 's En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to faces t@@ ou@@ gh start
As Mexico 's in@@ coming President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to pre@@ p@@ a@@ res to take office , the BBC 's Will G@@ rant looks at the challenges facing him and the m@@ i@@ x@@ ed expectations of his population .
T@@ r@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ ic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present .
A con@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ed city at the best of times , a ring of st@@ e@@ el has been er@@ ec@@ ted since Monday c@@ ut@@ ting off several key ro@@ ut@@ es into the capital and c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ing ch@@ a@@ os on the roads .
The a@@ im , however , wasn 't to stop com@@ m@@ u@@ ters getting to work but prevent p@@ ro@@ te@@ st@@ ers from re@@ a@@ ch@@ ing par@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
On Saturday , Mexico 's new president En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation .
He faces a complicated t@@ ask .
Mexico has been per@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ing well e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ically under the out@@ going administration of F@@ el@@ i@@ p@@ e Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country is in the g@@ ri@@ p of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 6@@ 0,000 li@@ ves in six years .
" My government has a great com@@ mit@@ ment to the M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an people to reduce the viol@@ ence , " Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week .
I will be p@@ ro@@ po@@ s@@ ing a new security strategy which will al@@ low us to achieve that a@@ im .
Be@@ f@@ or@@ e rub@@ b@@ ing sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s with the US president , Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to 's previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the State of Mexico .
A pop@@ ul@@ ou@@ s , spra@@ w@@ ling state s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unding the capital , opinions about the new leader are di@@ vi@@ ded in his old st@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ ing ground .
A stra@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ forward man
In the b@@ u@@ co@@ li@@ c town of V@@ alle de@@ l B@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ o , for example , he is re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ ed f@@ on@@ d@@ ly .
R@@ es@@ id@@ ent@@ s credit him with b@@ oo@@ st@@ ing to@@ ur@@ ism in the re@@ s@@ or@@ t and building in@@ f@@ r@@ a@@ structure .
To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to 's new motor@@ ways , a v@@ ast improvement on the cracked and b@@ ump@@ y roads it re@@ plac@@ ed .
Pla@@ qu@@ es be@@ aring his name also h@@ an@@ g outside a modern sp@@ or@@ ts centre and an impressive inter@@ active museum about climate change .
" We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , " says friend and political ally G@@ ab@@ ri@@ el O@@ l@@ v@@ er@@ a Hern@@ an@@ dez , a state con@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ man for Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to 's party , the P@@ R@@ I .
P@@ ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in terms of security and the economy , we 're hoping for an inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing and tru@@ e change which our country so b@@ ad@@ ly ne@@ e@@ ds .
After an un@@ broken 81 years in power , the P@@ R@@ I was ou@@ sted in 2000 by V@@ i@@ c@@ en@@ te Fox .
Con@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ man O@@ l@@ v@@ er@@ a ad@@ m@@ its that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los P@@ in@@ os , there is much e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ tation within the party about En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to .
And he re@@ j@@ ec@@ ts the opposition 's char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ s@@ ation of the new president as l@@ ac@@ king substance .
He 's a very stra@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ forward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
He 's an excellent st@@ at@@ es@@ man and , above all , he 's someone who knows how to listen .
But on the other side of the state , that is not the im@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on many people have of their former governor .
In Ne@@ z@@ ah@@ u@@ al@@ co@@ yo@@ t@@ l , also known as Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ne@@ z@@ a , the con@@ tr@@ ast with the co@@ bbled streets of V@@ alle de@@ l B@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ o couldn 't be sh@@ ar@@ per .
Tu@@ ck@@ ed away under motor@@ way f@@ l@@ yo@@ v@@ er@@ s , it is in many ways a su@@ bur@@ b of Mexico City itself .
And the problems in the m@@ un@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality are also g@@ r@@ it@@ ty and urban .
Earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug g@@ an@@ g@@ s operating in the n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ h@@ oo@@ ds , and viol@@ ence against women is particularly ac@@ ute .
On a p@@ at@@ ch of w@@ ast@@ el@@ and by a v@@ ast l@@ an@@ d@@ f@@ ill site , the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone .
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to was governor , a rate much higher than in the n@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ ously violent city of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z - a place sy@@ n@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ou@@ s with the murder of in@@ n@@ o@@ cent women .
Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to 's c@@ r@@ it@@ ics say , at best , he failed to adequately address the problem of f@@ em@@ icide while he was in office .
At worst , they ac@@ c@@ use his administration of turning a b@@ l@@ ind eye .
In a concrete home typical of the r@@ und@@ own n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ hood , I@@ r@@ ine@@ a Bu@@ en@@ dia st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ es to fight back the te@@ ars as she shows me photos of her late daughter , Mar@@ i@@ ana L@@ un@@ a .
According to the official version of events , Mar@@ i@@ ana committed su@@ icide in 20@@ 10 .
However her family believes she was murdered by her par@@ t@@ ner .
" When I arrived at her h@@ ou@@ se it seemed her body had been w@@ ashed , " Sen@@ or@@ a Bu@@ en@@ dia rec@@ all@@ s .
There were signs she 'd been be@@ at@@ en , and ri@@ g@@ or m@@ or@@ tis had already set in .
As her mother re@@ counts the story , a picture of Mar@@ i@@ ana looks down from the walls , next to a c@@ ro@@ s@@ s be@@ aring a single word : Justice .
However , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
The state authorities have treated me like I 'm an old go@@ s@@ si@@ p , a troub@@ le@@ -@@ maker , a w@@ h@@ in@@ er .
What they want is that one simply ac@@ c@@ ep@@ ts what they say and sh@@ ut@@ s up .
" But that can 't be right when there were so many ir@@ re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ it@@ i@@ es and o@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ sions , " she says .
As President P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility .
T@@ ens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed to make them a priority during his time in office .
" I hope he 's the same kind of president as he was a governor , " says P@@ R@@ I Con@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ man O@@ l@@ v@@ er@@ a in V@@ alle de@@ l B@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ o .
That , however , is exactly what v@@ i@@ c@@ tim@@ s ' families in Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ne@@ z@@ a most fear .
Bradley Manning didn 't complain about m@@ i@@ st@@ re@@ at@@ ment , prosecutors con@@ t@@ end
Prosecutors try to counter Bradley Manning 's claims of abuse in con@@ fin@@ em@@ ent
The hearing fo@@ c@@ us@@ es on Manning 's time in the military bri@@ g at Q@@ u@@ an@@ tic@@ o , Virginia
Defense wants case dismissed on gro@@ un@@ ds that Manning 's con@@ fin@@ em@@ ent was har@@ s@@ h
The Army private is accused of st@@ e@@ aling thousands of c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fied documents
Prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bradley Manning -- charged in the largest le@@ a@@ k of c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fied material in U.S. history -- missed mul@@ ti@@ p@@ le op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es to complain about the m@@ i@@ st@@ re@@ at@@ ment he 's alleging he suffered in military custody .
While cross-@@ e@@ x@@ am@@ in@@ ing Manning at a pre@@ -@@ trial hearing at F@@ t . Me@@ a@@ de , Maryland , p@@ ro@@ se@@ c@@ ut@@ or Ma@@ j@@ . A@@ sh@@ d@@ en F@@ e@@ in as@@ s@@ er@@ ted that records of weekly v@@ i@@ s@@ its Manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Q@@ u@@ an@@ tic@@ o , Virginia , show no com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ts about his treatment .
The cross-@@ e@@ x@@ am@@ in@@ ation -- during a hearing on a defense mo@@ ti@@ on to have Manning 's case dismissed on gro@@ un@@ ds that his con@@ fin@@ em@@ ent has been har@@ s@@ h and has am@@ oun@@ ted to enough punishment -- came a day after Manning te@@ st@@ i@@ fied that he had considered su@@ icide while in custody .
The Army intelligence an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ t , arrested in June 20@@ 10 , is accused of st@@ e@@ aling thousands of c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fied documents while serving in Iraq .
The material was then published online by W@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s .
W@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information .
In Friday 's hearing , F@@ e@@ in reviewed with Manning the f@@ or@@ m@@ s that officers filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Q@@ u@@ an@@ tic@@ o 's bri@@ g , where he was held under a h@@ e@@ i@@ ghten@@ ed con@@ fin@@ em@@ ent status from July 20@@ 10 to April 20@@ 11 .
O@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ers would ask Manning questions and write down his re@@ sp@@ on@@ s@@ es .
When F@@ e@@ in asked about the f@@ or@@ m@@ s Friday , Manning acknowledged that he r@@ ated treatment by his guards as " excellent " and treatment by the f@@ ac@@ ility overall as " very professional . "
The f@@ or@@ m@@ s show no com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ts of m@@ i@@ st@@ re@@ at@@ ment , even though the officers asked Manning directly about his treatment , F@@ e@@ in con@@ ten@@ ded .
Manning responded that he would v@@ er@@ b@@ ally e@@ x@@ press concern about issues and that the v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ing officers would talk through the concerns and in@@ di@@ c@@ ate that they would be addressed , but they didn 't record the issues .
" They would write down ' no issues ' ( after di@@ sc@@ us@@ s@@ ing the concerns ) , and it didn 't necessarily mean I didn 't bring something up , " Manning said .
The judge , Army Col@@ . Den@@ ise L@@ ind , also asked Manning why he didn 't complain about his treatment during a January 20@@ 11 meeting with a board e@@ x@@ am@@ in@@ ing the su@@ i@@ c@@ id@@ al th@@ ou@@ gh@@ ts he expressed in a form months earlier .
Manning replied that his in@@ ten@@ ti@@ on during that meeting was to get his " prevention of injury " status down@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ded .
The military said they put him on this re@@ stri@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ e status -- a step below su@@ icide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
" I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the P@@ O@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my vie@@ w@@ point , " Manning said .
Manning te@@ st@@ i@@ fied Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to K@@ u@@ wait , where he was held for nearly two months before being trans@@ fer@@ red to the bri@@ g at Mar@@ ine B@@ as@@ e Q@@ u@@ an@@ tic@@ o in Virginia in July 20@@ 10 .
He said he con@@ te@@ m@@ pl@@ ated su@@ icide in K@@ u@@ wait and once passed out there due to the heat .
He said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was di@@ st@@ re@@ s@@ sing .
" My world just s@@ h@@ r@@ ink to Camp A@@ r@@ a@@ f@@ j@@ on , to that cage , " Manning said Thursday .
I th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t I was going to die in that cage .
Once at Q@@ u@@ an@@ tic@@ o , Manning said , he spend most days in a small c@@ el@@ l -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
Manning said he was allowed only a m@@ att@@ re@@ s@@ s , blan@@ k@@ et , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps , some clothes and his gl@@ as@@ s@@ es .
He said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even l@@ y@@ ing down was against the r@@ ul@@ es .
Manning said he always slept with light from outside his c@@ el@@ l in his eyes .
If guards could not see his face when he ro@@ l@@ led over at night , he said they would w@@ ak@@ e him to ro@@ ll back over .
Manning 's lawyer filed a f@@ or@@ m@@ al ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ti@@ on to Manning 's treatment in January 20@@ 11 .
Manning was mo@@ v@@ ed to the military p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on at Fort Le@@ av@@ en@@ worth , Kansas , in April 20@@ 11 .
Also Friday , the judge asked Manning about an al@@ le@@ g@@ ation that he made in Thursday 's te@@ st@@ im@@ ony -- that after being forced to sle@@ ep n@@ aked one night in his Q@@ u@@ an@@ tic@@ o c@@ el@@ l , he was forced to st@@ and n@@ aked in front of guards and other in@@ mates during a morning head count .
Manning had te@@ st@@ i@@ fied that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blan@@ k@@ et during the head count .
Under questioning from the judge Friday , Manning said that he in@@ fer@@ red from his guard 's order that he should drop a blan@@ k@@ et that could have co@@ v@@ er@@ ed him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
Manning te@@ st@@ i@@ fied Thursday that he was forced to sle@@ ep n@@ aked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn 't a danger to himself .
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ i@@ st@@ b@@ and of his un@@ der@@ wear or his fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps to hurt himself but ha@@ d@@ n 't done so .
That night , Manning te@@ st@@ i@@ fied , his un@@ der@@ wear , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps and gl@@ as@@ s@@ es were removed from his c@@ el@@ l .
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his e@@ x@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ ces during con@@ fin@@ em@@ ent into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be con@@ v@@ i@@ c@@ ted at his cour@@ t@@ -@@ m@@ ar@@ ti@@ al , which is expected to begin early next year .
The defense has said it plans to have Manning p@@ le@@ ad guilty to l@@ es@@ s@@ er off@@ en@@ s@@ es and fight other charges as being too extreme .
The hearing is scheduled to re@@ su@@ me this weekend , with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were war@@ r@@ an@@ ted .
The Pentagon has m@@ a@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ed that Manning was held in ac@@ c@@ or@@ d@@ ance with r@@ ul@@ es governing all m@@ a@@ xim@@ um@@ -@@ custody de@@ ta@@ in@@ e@@ es at Q@@ u@@ an@@ tic@@ o .
C@@ o@@ un@@ ts against Manning include ai@@ ding the en@@ em@@ y , w@@ r@@ on@@ g@@ fully c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ing intelligence to be published on the Internet , trans@@ mit@@ ting national defense information and theft of public property or records .
If he 's con@@ v@@ i@@ c@@ ted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .

Signs po@@ in@@ ted the way to two lines : one for " M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an@@ os " ( " M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ans " ) , another for " Ex@@ tr@@ an@@ j@@ er@@ os " ( " Fo@@ re@@ ign@@ ers . " )
I st@@ ood there for a few se@@ con@@ ds , un@@ sure of where to go .
Gro@@ wing up in Centr@@ al California , I had been called a " M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an " my en@@ ti@@ re life .
It 's ethnic shor@@ th@@ and in the same way that my friends in Boston re@@ fer to themselves as " Irish " or my friends in New York describe themselves as " Italian . "
L@@ ater , I settled on " M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ American . "
But , this was Mexico .
And , in the homeland of my g@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ father , there was no need for shor@@ th@@ and or h@@ y@@ ph@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language .
But I don 't have the voc@@ ab@@ ulary of a native , and I can 't s@@ ha@@ k@@ e my American accent .
So I took my U.S. p@@ as@@ sport and got in the line for Ex@@ tr@@ an@@ j@@ er@@ os .
I th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t about that moment this week when M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an pre@@ sident-@@ el@@ ec@@ t En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ed the White House to meet with President Obama .
On the ag@@ en@@ d@@ a , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to was also e@@ ag@@ er to talk about the growth of the M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an economy , which is one reason that M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States .
He wants to par@@ t@@ ner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Un@@ i@@ on-@@ style trading blo@@ c in North America .
And P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to vowed to continue Mexico 's war against the drug car@@ tel@@ s , even though he offered no spec@@ i@@ f@@ ics .
For Mexico , the rel@@ ation@@ ship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard fe@@ el@@ ings .
Most Americans probably never give a th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States in@@ v@@ ad@@ ed Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y at the point of ri@@ f@@ le .
But for M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ans , who think in terms of c@@ ent@@ ur@@ ies , not minutes , the re@@ m@@ in@@ der@@ s are e@@ very@@ where .
So the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit c@@ r@@ it@@ ical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an press , and among the el@@ it@@ es -- com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ts about how the Americans are en@@ c@@ ro@@ a@@ ch@@ ing upon their n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ or 's so@@ v@@ er@@ e@@ i@@ gn@@ ty .
And the children of Mon@@ te@@ z@@ um@@ a go on the war@@ p@@ ath .
And yet , for Mexico , the really ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing rel@@ ation@@ ship is with the more than 35 million M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans living in the United States .
You want to talk about hard fe@@ el@@ ings ?
There is plenty .
Mexico has w@@ inners and lo@@ s@@ ers , people for whom the country provides op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es and others for whom it doesn 't .
The only reason you have so many people of M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an anc@@ e@@ st@@ ry living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Denver or San An@@ t@@ on@@ io is because , at some point in our family tre@@ e , there was a person , m@@ ay@@ be a par@@ ent or g@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ par@@ ent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north .
And more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark sk@@ in , little education , from a poor village , e@@ t@@ c .
We 're their off@@ sp@@ r@@ ing , and we 're loyal to them .
Not Mexico .
And even though we may now be living the American Dream , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose si@@ g@@ h@@ t of the fact that it 's the American Dream we 're living , and not the M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an one .
Our id@@ ent@@ ity might sometimes be f@@ u@@ z@@ z@@ y , but our loy@@ al@@ ty is clear .
It 's to the United States .
B@@ es@@ ides , we 're aw@@ are that many of the elite M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ans in the r@@ ul@@ ing class don 't like us .
The feeling is mut@@ ual .
They see us as a re@@ m@@ in@@ der of a h@@ um@@ ili@@ ating de@@ fe@@ at and look down on us as in@@ fer@@ i@@ or stock that isn 't su@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ent@@ ly M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an .
Our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough .
Our e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence is , as they see it , all about failure .
If our families ha@@ d@@ n 't failed in Mexico , they w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't have left .
And we w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't now find ourselves tra@@ pped behind the s@@ il@@ k cur@@ ta@@ in , living well in the United States but lost s@@ oul@@ s n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess .
My wife , who was bor@@ n in G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States le@@ g@@ ally as a child , re@@ m@@ in@@ ds me that there is fri@@ ction between M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ans and M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans because M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ans have a f@@ ir@@ m@@ er g@@ r@@ as@@ p of who they are and M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans re@@ s@@ ent that .
While she 's a U.S. c@@ it@@ i@@ zen , she se@@ es herself as a part of two countries .
Me@@ an@@ while , many M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans I know don 't feel like they 're a part of either .
We love list@@ en@@ ing to the M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an b@@ and , Los T@@ ig@@ res de@@ l Nor@@ te , but also to B@@ ru@@ ce Sp@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ st@@ e@@ en .
You get the best of both wor@@ l@@ ds , but you 're roo@@ ted in neither .
In Mexico , we 're seen as Americans .
And in the United States , we 're considered M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an .
Now , to com@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the rel@@ ation@@ ship even further , as I learned during my trip , some M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an leaders and parts of the in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent@@ si@@ a want to re@@ connect with the Di@@ as@@ p@@ or@@ a .
They want to put M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans to work as m@@ ak@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ t " am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors " for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States .
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to str@@ eng@@ then ties with Mexico .
Ye@@ ah .
That 's not going to happen .
T@@ o@@ o many hard fe@@ el@@ ings .
And , with income ine@@ quality and r@@ am@@ p@@ ant corruption and drug viol@@ ence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I 'm af@@ r@@ a@@ id you 're on your own , am@@ ig@@ os .
That 's fair .
If at least some M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ans aren 't yet read@@ y to f@@ or@@ give the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans still hold a g@@ ru@@ dge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
H@@ m@@ m@@ m .
M@@ ay@@ be we 're more " M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an " than I th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t .
O@@ l@@ d b@@ att@@ l@@ es , new M@@ id@@ d@@ le East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an un@@ likely foundation for peace
C@@ an there ever be a lasting peace between Arab@@ s and Jews in the M@@ id@@ d@@ le East ?
Another round of b@@ loo@@ d@@ sh@@ ed suggests that any such hope is v@@ a@@ in .
Am@@ id the usual f@@ ut@@ ile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rub@@ ble ; more than 1@@ 40 Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans , most of them civilians , and six I@@ s@@ r@@ a@@ el@@ is have been killed ; and , for the first time , mis@@ s@@ il@@ es from G@@ a@@ z@@ a have l@@ an@@ d@@ ed near Tel A@@ vi@@ v , Israel 's m@@ e@@ t@@ ro@@ po@@ li@@ s , and the holy city of J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m .
But though the I@@ s@@ r@@ a@@ el@@ is and Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans seem st@@ u@@ ck in their an@@ c@@ i@@ ent con@@ fli@@ c@@ t , all around them the M@@ id@@ d@@ le East is ch@@ ang@@ ing .
The Arab sp@@ r@@ ing has thrown the p@@ i@@ e@@ ces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans and I@@ s@@ r@@ a@@ el@@ is are caught up in the regional tur@@ mo@@ il .
M@@ ay@@ be this will make their st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ le b@@ loo@@ di@@ er than before .
However , there are re@@ as@@ on@@ s for thinking it could just break their lethal st@@ al@@ em@@ ate .
A war that is neither lost or won
At first si@@ g@@ h@@ t , optimism looks very hard to j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ y now .
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 2@@ 1@@ s@@ t h@@ ol@@ ds , this week 's fighting has strengthened the ha@@ w@@ ks on both sides .
The leaders of Hamas , the I@@ s@@ lam@@ ist movement that has ruled G@@ a@@ z@@ a since 2007 , will claim to have forced the I@@ s@@ r@@ a@@ el@@ is to back off , even though G@@ a@@ z@@ a has taken a dru@@ b@@ b@@ ing .
Despite killing some of its leaders and bott@@ ling up G@@ a@@ z@@ a 's 1.@@ 7@@ m people in one of the most w@@ re@@ t@@ ched and crowded cor@@ ners of the pl@@ an@@ et , Israel has failed to de@@ st@@ ro@@ y Hamas .
In@@ de@@ ed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Pal@@ e@@ st@@ ine currently run by its bitter ri@@ v@@ als in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian f@@ ac@@ ti@@ on .
Mo@@ re@@ over , Hamas 's leaders may well conc@@ lu@@ de that time is on their side .
As I@@ s@@ lam@@ ists across the Arab world have gained cl@@ out , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
T@@ ur@@ key , a re@@ s@@ ur@@ g@@ ent regional power that was once Israel 's closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas 's cause ; so has Q@@ at@@ ar , one of the ri@@ ch@@ est and most dynamic of the Gulf states .
Jub@@ il@@ ant Hamas people say an I@@ s@@ lam@@ ist c@@ re@@ s@@ cent is cur@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the H@@ iz@@ bul@@ la@@ h par@@ t@@ y-@@ c@@ um@@ -@@ m@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ a h@@ ol@@ ds s@@ way , through Syria , where re@@ b@@ el@@ s of an increasingly I@@ s@@ lam@@ ist b@@ ent may topple B@@ ash@@ ar A@@ s@@ sad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas 's allies are men@@ acing the king .
A@@ bo@@ v@@ e all , on Israel 's southern f@@ l@@ an@@ k , the rise of the Muslim B@@ ro@@ th@@ er@@ hood under President Mu@@ h@@ am@@ m@@ a@@ d Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most pop@@ ul@@ ou@@ s and p@@ i@@ vo@@ t@@ al of Arab countries , has changed the region 's balance .
Ho@@ s@@ n@@ i M@@ u@@ b@@ ar@@ ak , the se@@ c@@ ul@@ ar des@@ pot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 20@@ 11 , had little time for Hamas .
By con@@ tr@@ ast , the B@@ ro@@ th@@ er@@ hood is a c@@ ou@@ s@@ in of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
In future di@@ pl@@ o@@ m@@ acy Hamas may em@@ er@@ ge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America .
Me@@ an@@ while , Israel 's hard@@ liners will draw the opposite conc@@ lu@@ sions .
In military terms , Hamas has been put back in its bo@@ x .
Israel 's I@@ r@@ on D@@ o@@ m@@ e anti-@@ mis@@ s@@ ile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas 's mis@@ s@@ il@@ es have been de@@ st@@ ro@@ y@@ ed .
I@@ s@@ r@@ a@@ el@@ is will sle@@ ep more so@@ und@@ ly - for a while .
In di@@ pl@@ o@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c terms , America is as st@@ e@@ ad@@ fast as ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of viol@@ ence .
A@@ bo@@ v@@ e all , Israel has prosp@@ ered , especially under B@@ in@@ y@@ am@@ in N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u , a prime minister who has largely ig@@ n@@ o@@ red the peace process .
Although rockets from G@@ a@@ z@@ a have killed around 30 I@@ s@@ r@@ a@@ el@@ is since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of su@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ de@@ -@@ b@@ o@@ m@@ bers , th@@ an@@ ks in part to the bar@@ ri@@ er that bit@@ es into the West Bank , the main ch@@ un@@ k of a w@@ oul@@ d@@ -@@ be Palestinian state , and p@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ ts the Jewish se@@ tt@@ le@@ ments that continue to expand despite their il@@ le@@ g@@ ality in international law .
Mr N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u , whose L@@ i@@ k@@ ud party has mer@@ ged with an even more ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish lot under A@@ v@@ ig@@ d@@ or L@@ i@@ e@@ b@@ er@@ man in the r@@ un@@ -@@ up to an election on January 2@@ 2@@ n@@ d , is sitting pretty .
W@@ h@@ y co@@ d@@ d@@ le those tw@@ i@@ st@@ y Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans by giving them a state of their own ?
If they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire rockets , just as their com@@ p@@ atri@@ o@@ ts have done in G@@ a@@ z@@ a ?
Bet@@ ter to keep them behind that w@@ all and s@@ mit@@ e them if they raise their heads .
M@@ ay@@ be the hard@@ liners will win out ; yet the Arab sp@@ r@@ ing may change their c@@ al@@ c@@ ul@@ ations .
Even if the I@@ s@@ lam@@ ists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be t@@ ac@@ k@@ l@@ ing difficulties at home .
Israel 's def@@ ence b@@ u@@ d@@ get is bigger than that of its four Arab n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ s combined .
St@@ ar@@ ting a war with the local super@@ power will har@@ d@@ ly help the new Arab governments m@@ end their e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ies .
That the p@@ r@@ ag@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c Mr Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to ob@@ ta@@ in a ceasefire a@@ u@@ g@@ ur@@ s well - and might just mark the start of something .
I@@ s@@ r@@ a@@ el@@ is too should look to the longer term .
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c , depri@@ ving Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans of their right to self-@@ determination is creating a po@@ w@@ der ke@@ g that is bo@@ un@@ d one day to explo@@ de in the ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ ies occupied by Israel - much as a b@@ us exploded in Tel A@@ vi@@ v this week .
Re@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on is already un@@ der@@ m@@ in@@ ing de@@ mo@@ cr@@ acy in the Jewish state , and de@@ mo@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ y e@@ x@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ at@@ es this as the Arab population s@@ w@@ ells .
B@@ loo@@ dy missions against G@@ a@@ z@@ a every few years to k@@ n@@ o@@ ck back Hamas will exact a growing di@@ pl@@ o@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c t@@ ol@@ l .
Both sides need p@@ ro@@ d@@ ding by outsiders
The answer remains the one tru@@ mp@@ eted by sen@@ si@@ ble people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel ce@@ ding ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y for security .
The hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more le@@ v@@ er@@ age to outsiders p@@ ush@@ ing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about st@@ op@@ p@@ ing the flow of arms into G@@ a@@ z@@ a , along with T@@ ur@@ key and Q@@ at@@ ar , is better plac@@ ed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 7 bo@@ und@@ ar@@ ies with land s@@ w@@ a@@ p@@ s and a shared J@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ e@@ m .
Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together .
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the im@@ m@@ in@@ ent bid for v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al st@@ at@@ e@@ h@@ ood at the U@@ N .
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
During his first term , he neg@@ le@@ c@@ ted to present his own plan for peace .
B@@ ac@@ k in the White House , he is looking just as re@@ lu@@ c@@ t@@ ant to be drawn in .
This is w@@ o@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly short@@ -@@ si@@ gh@@ ted .
America has a v@@ it@@ al interest in a st@@ able M@@ id@@ d@@ le East .
That m@@ e@@ ans a peace se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment between Israel and the Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans .
C@@ ig@@ are@@ t@@ te pl@@ a@@ in p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ing la@@ ws come into force in Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a
S@@ mo@@ king warnings and di@@ se@@ ased body parts em@@ bla@@ z@@ on@@ ed on d@@ ul@@ l g@@ re@@ en bo@@ xes that are the same for all to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o brands
Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a 's wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ first la@@ ws on cigarette and to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o pl@@ a@@ in p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ing have come into force , re@@ plac@@ ing brand lo@@ go@@ s and col@@ ours with gen@@ er@@ ic dra@@ b o@@ live g@@ re@@ en co@@ v@@ er@@ ings , g@@ ru@@ es@@ o@@ m@@ e pictures of di@@ se@@ ased body parts and de@@ p@@ i@@ c@@ tions of children and babies made ill by their parents ' smoking .
A@@ part from the v@@ ar@@ y@@ ing health warnings and images the only di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence between the p@@ ac@@ ks , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all p@@ r@@ in@@ ted in i@@ den@@ tic@@ al small f@@ on@@ t .
It is the world 's most stri@@ c@@ t regime for the p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ing of to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o .
Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a 's federal government says the a@@ im is to de@@ ter young people from smoking by stri@@ p@@ p@@ ing the hab@@ it of gl@@ am@@ our .
It is relying on st@@ u@@ dies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
" Even from a very early age you can see that k@@ ids understand the m@@ es@@ s@@ age that the to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o company is trying to sell through their b@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ ing , " said the federal health minister , T@@ an@@ y@@ a P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , citing st@@ u@@ dies that showed , for example , children linking a crown in a lo@@ go with the idea of being a p@@ r@@ inc@@ ess .
While Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a has one of the world 's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on mul@@ t@@ in@@ ation@@ als ' profits , other countries are con@@ si@@ der@@ ing similar steps .
The to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o industry lo@@ b@@ b@@ i@@ ed hard against the la@@ ws .
T@@ ob@@ ac@@ c@@ o firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to ch@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ er , more ac@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ble c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es .
" There will be serious un@@ intended con@@ sequ@@ en@@ ces from the legislation , " said S@@ co@@ t@@ t Mc@@ In@@ ty@@ re of British American T@@ ob@@ ac@@ c@@ o Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a .
C@@ o@@ un@@ ter@@ f@@ e@@ it@@ ers from China and Indonesia will bring lo@@ ts more of these products down to sell on the streets of Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a .
Others say the la@@ ws have b@@ oo@@ sted their business .
S@@ an@@ d@@ ra H@@ a of Z@@ i@@ c@@ o Im@@ p@@ or@@ t P@@ ty Ltd , a small family business , said demand for cigarette cases , si@@ lic@@ on co@@ v@@ er@@ s to m@@ ask the un@@ p@@ al@@ at@@ able p@@ ack@@ ag@@ es , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American T@@ ob@@ ac@@ c@@ o , Britain 's Im@@ per@@ i@@ al T@@ ob@@ ac@@ c@@ o , Philip Mor@@ r@@ is and Japan T@@ ob@@ ac@@ c@@ o lost a challenge to the la@@ ws in Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a 's high court .
H@@ a said Z@@ i@@ c@@ o had sold up to 6,000 to w@@ h@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ e out@@ lets and was a@@ waiting new stock .
This is good business for us .
The potential h@@ it@@ ch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very de@@ mo@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ ic the plan is tar@@ g@@ e@@ ting .
After a series of Australian la@@ ws b@@ ann@@ ing TV advertising and sp@@ or@@ ts sponsorship and re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing most s@@ ell@@ ers to hi@@ de c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es from view , to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o marketing has mo@@ v@@ ed online .
Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a has banned w@@ e@@ b advertising by local companies and sites but cannot re@@ stri@@ c@@ t overseas sites .
" If you are a to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o m@@ ar@@ k@@ e@@ ter and you 've only got this small win@@ do@@ w left to p@@ ro@@ mo@@ te your products , online is the com@@ p@@ ell@@ ing place for you to be in , " said B@@ ec@@ ky Fre@@ em@@ an , a public health re@@ sear@@ cher at Sydney University .
Fre@@ em@@ an noted an increase in " average Joe " re@@ vie@@ ws of brands on social media sites such as Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , T@@ w@@ it@@ ter and Fac@@ e@@ b@@ oo@@ k .
We have to ask , is that just a private c@@ it@@ i@@ zen who really lo@@ ves Mar@@ l@@ boro c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es and they 've gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American T@@ ob@@ ac@@ c@@ o Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a said the industry was focused on de@@ aling with the new r@@ ul@@ es rather than marketing .
The industry has gone as far as paying for U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ ine , H@@ on@@ dur@@ as and the Domin@@ i@@ c@@ an Re@@ public to challenge the new r@@ ul@@ es - the countries are c@@ la@@ im@@ ing at the World T@@ r@@ a@@ de Or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation that trade is being un@@ fairly re@@ stri@@ c@@ ted , despite n@@ one of the countries having significant trade with Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a .
A W@@ TO r@@ ul@@ ing is likely in mid-@@ 20@@ 13 .
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said the government had held discussions with other countries con@@ si@@ der@@ ing similar la@@ ws on p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ing .
Canada was the first country to make photograph warnings mandatory in 2001 .
They now e@@ x@@ tend to more than 40 countries including B@@ r@@ a@@ z@@ il , T@@ ur@@ key and U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ ine .
Tou@@ g@@ her la@@ ws are being considered in Britain , New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , South Africa and India .
Many s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers in Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a remain de@@ fi@@ ant .
The pictures don 't affect me .
I just ign@@ or@@ e them .
" You just grab a smoke and put it away , " said V@@ i@@ c@@ tor El H@@ age as he pur@@ ch@@ ased a p@@ ac@@ k with a photograph of a m@@ ou@@ th t@@ um@@ our .
H@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ ly , there 's only one reason I 'd stop , and that 's my little g@@ ir@@ l .
James Y@@ u , who runs the King of the P@@ ac@@ k to@@ b@@ ac@@ con@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uni@@ form p@@ ack@@ ag@@ ing made it har@@ der to st@@ ac@@ k his sh@@ el@@ ves
" It used to take me an hour to un@@ lo@@ ad a delivery , now it takes me four hours , " Y@@ u said .

In a Con@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ ly P@@ lu@@ g@@ g@@ e@@ d@@ -@@ In World , It 's Not All Bad to Be Bo@@ red
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Thanksgiving h@@ o@@ li@@ day when our pl@@ an@@ e had m@@ e@@ ch@@ an@@ ical difficulties and we had to wait for another pl@@ an@@ e to arrive .
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of bo@@ re@@ do@@ m .
I won 't li@@ e to you .
Half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty te@@ di@@ ou@@ s , even with the di@@ str@@ actions of b@@ oo@@ ks , magazines and i@@ P@@ h@@ on@@ es ( not to men@@ ti@@ on d@@ ut@@ y-@@ free shopping ) .
But increasingly , some ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ics and child development experts are coming out in p@@ r@@ a@@ ise of bo@@ re@@ do@@ m .
It 's all right for us - and our children - to be bored on o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on , they say .
It forces the brain to go on inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing t@@ ang@@ ent@@ s , perhaps fo@@ stering c@@ re@@ ativity .
And because most of us are almost con@@ si@@ st@@ ent@@ ly plugged into one screen or another these days , we don 't experience the benefits of bo@@ re@@ do@@ m .
So should we em@@ b@@ r@@ ace bo@@ re@@ do@@ m ?
Yes .
And no .
But I 'll get back to that .
First of all , like many people , I as@@ su@@ m@@ ed that bo@@ re@@ do@@ m was a relatively recent ph@@ en@@ o@@ m@@ en@@ on , with the ad@@ v@@ ent of more le@@ i@@ s@@ ure time .
Not so , says Peter T@@ oo@@ h@@ e@@ y , a p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of G@@ re@@ ek and R@@ o@@ m@@ an history at the University of Cal@@ g@@ ar@@ y in Canada and the a@@ u@@ th@@ or of " Bo@@ re@@ do@@ m : A Li@@ v@@ ely History " ( Y@@ al@@ e University Press , 20@@ 11 ) .
" Bo@@ re@@ do@@ m actually has a very long history , " he said .
There 's Latin g@@ r@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ it@@ i about bo@@ re@@ do@@ m on the walls of P@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ e@@ i@@ i dating from the first century .
Th@@ en there 's the question of how we define bo@@ re@@ do@@ m .
The trouble is that it has been de@@ fin@@ ed , and di@@ sc@@ us@@ s@@ ed , in many different ways , said John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , an as@@ so@@ c@@ i@@ ate p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of psych@@ ology at York University in On@@ tar@@ io , Canada .
After looking over the research lit@@ er@@ ature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues de@@ fin@@ ed bo@@ re@@ do@@ m as an experience of " w@@ an@@ ting to , but being unable to eng@@ age in s@@ at@@ i@@ s@@ fying activity . "
What se@@ par@@ at@@ es bo@@ re@@ do@@ m from a@@ p@@ a@@ th@@ y , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
With a@@ p@@ a@@ th@@ y , he said , there is no urge to do something .
The core experience of bo@@ re@@ do@@ m , he said , is " di@@ s@@ ru@@ p@@ ti@@ on of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly . "
Bo@@ re@@ do@@ m can sound an aw@@ ful lot like depression .
But Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or E@@ ast@@ wood said that while they can be related , people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves .
Sometimes we think we 're bored when we just have di@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ul@@ ty concentrating .
In their study , " The Un@@ engaged M@@ ind : De@@ fin@@ ing Bo@@ re@@ do@@ m in T@@ er@@ ms of A@@ t@@ ten@@ ti@@ on , " which appeared in the jo@@ ur@@ n@@ al Per@@ spectives on P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ological Science in September , Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues po@@ in@@ ted to an earlier e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent in which parti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ an@@ ts list@@ en@@ ed to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
Some groups heard a l@@ oud and un@@ related television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely n@@ o@@ tic@@ e@@ able , while the third group didn 't hear the soundtrack at all .
The on@@ es who heard the lo@@ w@@ -@@ level TV reported more bo@@ re@@ do@@ m than the other two groups - they had di@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ul@@ ty concentrating but were not sure why , and attributed that di@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ul@@ ty to bo@@ re@@ do@@ m .
When you 're trying to focus on a difficult or eng@@ ag@@ ing t@@ ask , di@@ s@@ ru@@ p@@ ti@@ on of attention can lead to bo@@ re@@ do@@ m , said Mark J. F@@ en@@ s@@ k@@ e , an as@@ so@@ c@@ i@@ ate p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of ne@@ u@@ ro@@ science at the University of G@@ u@@ el@@ p@@ h in On@@ tar@@ io and one of the authors of the study .
On the other hand , when you 're doing something d@@ ul@@ l , " such as looking for bad wi@@ d@@ gets on a factory line , di@@ str@@ ac@@ ting music can help you not be bored . "
In fact , he said , we now know that s@@ qu@@ ir@@ m@@ ing and d@@ oo@@ d@@ ling , often seen as a sign of bo@@ re@@ do@@ m , can actually help com@@ b@@ at it by keeping people more physi@@ c@@ ally alert .
" Research shows that k@@ ids who are allowed to fi@@ d@@ get le@@ ar@@ n more and re@@ ta@@ in more information than those who are forced to sit still , " Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or F@@ en@@ s@@ k@@ e said .
We all experience bo@@ re@@ do@@ m at some points - my flight d@@ el@@ ay , a d@@ r@@ oning speaker , a particularly te@@ di@@ ou@@ s movie .
But some in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als are more likely to be bored than others .
To help measure this , researchers developed a " Bo@@ re@@ do@@ m P@@ r@@ on@@ en@@ ess S@@ c@@ al@@ e " in the 1980s .
The sc@@ al@@ e includes questions like , " Many things I have to do are re@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e and m@@ on@@ o@@ t@@ on@@ ou@@ s , " and " I have so many interests , I don 't have time to do everything . "
U@@ sing such sc@@ ales , researchers have discovered that bo@@ ys tend to be bored more often than girls , said Stephen V@@ o@@ d@@ an@@ o@@ vi@@ ch , a p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of psych@@ ology at the University of West Florida , especially when it comes ne@@ e@@ ding more , and a v@@ ar@@ i@@ e@@ ty of , external st@@ im@@ ul@@ ation .
But in general , te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers are a pretty j@@ ad@@ ed lot .
In 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 1 , Reed Lar@@ son , a p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of human and community development at the University of Illinois , conducted an e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent in which he con@@ t@@ acted almost 4@@ 00 te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers and their parents seven to eight times a day by be@@ ep@@ er .
He found that 3@@ 2 percent of adol@@ es@@ cents said they were bored in school and doing h@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ work , while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren 't in school .
On the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were bored .
Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or Lar@@ son said he did not know whether the bo@@ re@@ do@@ m per@@ c@@ ent@@ ag@@ es now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
But he said he did know that " adol@@ es@@ c@@ ence is a pe@@ ak period for bo@@ re@@ do@@ m , " largely because children and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
So back to my original question : Is bo@@ re@@ do@@ m good for you ?
Sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take ab@@ s@@ ur@@ d physical risks , gam@@ ble or in@@ d@@ ul@@ ge in substance abuse as a way to e@@ as@@ e it , research shows .
On the other hand , many ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ ers and writers discuss the connection between bo@@ re@@ do@@ m and c@@ re@@ ativity , said Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or V@@ o@@ d@@ an@@ o@@ vi@@ ch , who has been st@@ ud@@ y@@ ing the issue for more than two decades .
" Bo@@ re@@ do@@ m is the brain 's way to tell you you should be doing something else , " said G@@ ar@@ y Marcus , a p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of psych@@ ology at N.@@ Y@@ .@@ U .
But the brain doesn 't always know the most appro@@ pri@@ ate thing to do .
If you 're bored and use that energy to play guitar and co@@ o@@ k , it will make you happy .
But if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
So if your child is bored and you give him an i@@ P@@ ad , he may not be bored anymore , but he hasn 't learned how to ent@@ er@@ ta@@ in himself , or self re@@ g@@ ul@@ ate , Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or F@@ en@@ s@@ k@@ e said .
And " that self-@@ re@@ g@@ ul@@ ation transfers from one situation to other , " he said .
Y@@ our kid doesn 't just le@@ ar@@ n to ent@@ er@@ ta@@ in himself , but gets more self-@@ control in other areas .
I don 't think we really want to celebrate bo@@ re@@ do@@ m .
N@@ or should we be too c@@ r@@ it@@ ical of it .
Rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant ch@@ at@@ ter of activity and technology .
Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or E@@ ast@@ wood agreed .
" We f@@ r@@ am@@ e it as we need to be bored more , but bo@@ re@@ do@@ m is an ag@@ on@@ izing , rest@@ less des@@ ir@@ e to be con@@ ne@@ c@@ ted with something m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ ful , " he said .
What people are really searching for , he said , is a way to un@@ pl@@ u@@ g and enjoy down time .
" In an environment where we are con@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ ly over@@ stimul@@ ated , " he said , " it 's hard to find ways to eng@@ age when the n@@ o@@ ise sh@@ ut@@ s down . "
In Colorado , No P@@ l@@ ay@@ book for New Mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana Law
An@@ th@@ ony O@@ ro@@ z@@ co , 19 , a community college student and soccer player in sou@@ theastern Colorado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few n@@ u@@ g@@ gets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lam@@ ar , on the pl@@ ain@@ s near the Kansas border , when they were pulled over .
After the police officer found marijuana in the car , Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co was issued a su@@ m@@ m@@ on@@ s for possession and drug par@@ a@@ p@@ her@@ n@@ al@@ i@@ a - p@@ e@@ t@@ ty off@@ en@@ s@@ es that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
" We get treated like criminals , " Mr. O@@ ro@@ z@@ co said .
But is he one ?
In the un@@ certain weeks after Colorado 's vote to le@@ g@@ al@@ i@@ ze small amounts of marijuana for rec@@ re@@ ational use , the answer in hundreds of m@@ in@@ or drug cases de@@ p@@ en@@ ds less on the law than on lo@@ c@@ ation .
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of mis@@ de@@ m@@ e@@ an@@ or marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
Police de@@ par@@ t@@ ments have st@@ op@@ p@@ ed char@@ ging ad@@ ul@@ ts 21 years and older for s@@ m@@ all-@@ sc@@ al@@ e possession that will be le@@ g@@ ally s@@ anc@@ ti@@ on@@ ed once the la@@ ws take effect in the coming weeks .
But prosecutors in more conservative pre@@ c@@ inc@@ ts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession .
At the same time , several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , st@@ at@@ e-@@ lic@@ en@@ s@@ ed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities .
" This thing is e@@ v@@ ol@@ ving so quickly that I don 't know what 's going to happen next , " said Daniel J. O@@ at@@ es , the police chief in A@@ ur@@ or@@ a , just east of Denver .
Reg@@ ul@@ at@@ ors in Washington State are also sc@@ r@@ at@@ ching their heads .
And they are looking for g@@ u@@ id@@ ance on how to set up a system of lic@@ en@@ s@@ es for production , manufacturing , di@@ stri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on and sales - all by a de@@ ad@@ line of Dec. 1 , 20@@ 13 .
They say that Colorado , for better or wor@@ se , is ahead of most states in re@@ g@@ ul@@ ating marijuana , first for medical use and now rec@@ re@@ ation@@ ally .
" Colorado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good g@@ u@@ i@@ de , " said Brian E. Smith , a spokesman for the Washington State Li@@ qu@@ or Con@@ tro@@ l Board .
But no place or system , Mr. Smith conceded , can do more than suggest what might work .
" There 's no real pre@@ ce@@ dent for us to follow , " he said .
Washington 's law , called I-@@ 50@@ 2 , takes effect on Dec. 6 , which also leaves a year of li@@ m@@ b@@ o during which the state lic@@ en@@ s@@ ing system will not yet exist , but le@@ g@@ al@@ i@@ z@@ ed possession will .
And there are th@@ or@@ n@@ y m@@ e@@ ch@@ an@@ ical questions that must be re@@ sol@@ v@@ ed during that time , like how to balance the state 's m@@ an@@ d@@ ate of " adequate access " to lic@@ en@@ s@@ ed marijuana with its p@@ ro@@ h@@ ib@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s on cann@@ ab@@ is b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es within 1,000 feet of a school , park , pl@@ ay@@ ground or child care center .
" N@@ o@@ where will it be more difficult to site a lic@@ en@@ s@@ ed cann@@ ab@@ is business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle m@@ e@@ t@@ ro@@ p@@ ol@@ it@@ an area , " said Ben Li@@ v@@ in@@ g@@ st@@ on , a spokesman for the Center for Le@@ g@@ al C@@ ann@@ ab@@ is , a recently formed research group .
On N@@ o@@ v@@ . 21 , Chief O@@ at@@ es in A@@ ur@@ or@@ a sent his officers an e-mail an@@ n@@ o@@ un@@ c@@ ing that the city att@@ or@@ ne@@ y would no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop char@@ ging people for those crimes " effective immediately . "
Chief O@@ at@@ es said that the police would en@@ force city co@@ des re@@ g@@ ul@@ ating medical marijuana gro@@ wers , and that they would still pur@@ su@@ e drug tra@@ f@@ f@@ ick@@ ers and de@@ al@@ ers .
In northern Colorado 's W@@ el@@ d County , the di@@ stri@@ c@@ t att@@ or@@ ne@@ y , K@@ en Bu@@ ck , represents a stric@@ ter view .
After the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases , mostly as a way to press us@@ ers into getting treatment .
R@@ ig@@ h@@ t now , 1@@ 19 people face charges of po@@ s@@ s@@ es@@ s@@ ing two oun@@ ces or less of marijuana , though many are facing other charges .
" Our office has an obligation to p@@ ro@@ se@@ c@@ ute off@@ en@@ s@@ es that were crimes at the time they occurred , " Mr. Bu@@ ck said in a statement .
The response has been complicated even in plac@@ es like r@@ ur@@ al Mes@@ a County , where voters re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted the marijuana in@@ it@@ i@@ ative .
The police in Gr@@ and Jun@@ ction , the co@@ un@@ ty 's largest city , are no longer citing ad@@ ul@@ ts for possession of small amounts .
The co@@ un@@ ty 's di@@ stri@@ c@@ t att@@ or@@ ne@@ y , Pete Hau@@ t@@ z@@ in@@ g@@ er , su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted that decision , but also decided not to di@@ s@@ mis@@ s all of the p@@ en@@ ding possession cases .
" I do not think I 'm wasting my time continuing to en@@ force the law until it changes , " he said .
Although 5@@ 5 percent of Colorado voters su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted the measure , bringing rec@@ re@@ ational marijuana into the fol@@ ds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
And the con@@ tra@@ di@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ y re@@ actions across the state l@@ ay bare a deep am@@ b@@ i@@ v@@ al@@ ence among local officials about the state 's big g@@ re@@ en e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent .
" It 's a cultural bar@@ ri@@ er " with di@@ stri@@ c@@ t attorneys , said S@@ e@@ an Mc@@ Al@@ li@@ ster , a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana def@@ en@@ d@@ an@@ ts and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Re@@ form of Mar@@ i@@ ju@@ ana La@@ ws .
" They spent so much of their li@@ ves prosecuting people that they still don 't really accept that this is legal , " he said .
As the first states to tre@@ at small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , Colorado and Washington are po@@ ised to become national test cases for drug le@@ g@@ alization .
As advocates and state officials plan for a new f@@ r@@ on@@ tier of le@@ g@@ al@@ i@@ z@@ ed sales , they are also an@@ x@@ i@@ ously a@@ waiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to tre@@ at the sale and c@@ ul@@ tiv@@ ation of marijuana as federal crimes .
Ad@@ voc@@ at@@ es for le@@ g@@ al@@ i@@ z@@ ed marijuana are hoping the Justice Department y@@ i@@ el@@ ds .
Despite some high-profile ar@@ re@@ st@@ s of medical marijuana patients and s@@ ell@@ ers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es to op@@ er@@ ate in Colorado , Washington and 16 other states .
While drug agents will probably not beat down do@@ ors to s@@ e@@ i@@ ze a small bag of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the st@@ at@@ e-@@ regulated rec@@ re@@ ational marijuana shops allowed under the new la@@ ws , said K@@ e@@ v@@ in A. S@@ a@@ bet , a former drug policy ad@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ er in the Obama administration .
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
Even before E@@ le@@ ction Day , some local governments approved m@@ or@@ at@@ ori@@ um@@ s on any new marijuana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
Last week , the western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se took up a six-@@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
" We don 't want to be put in a position where we license s@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ dy and then have a big federal issue , " said Bo@@ b N@@ ich@@ ol@@ son , a City Council member .
Our community vo@@ ted against this am@@ en@@ d@@ ment .
We 're looking at what the community vo@@ ted for v@@ er@@ su@@ s what the state vo@@ ted for .
There 's an aw@@ ful lot of questions .
P@@ e@@ t@@ ron@@ ell@@ a Wy@@ att : I was bul@@ li@@ ed out of Oxford for being a Tory
It is not just today 's un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity students who are attacked for their vie@@ ws
I can 't remember a time when I didn 't d@@ re@@ am of winning a place at Oxford University .
Both my father and my el@@ der brother had been at what I imagined was the world 's greatest seat of le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing , a mo@@ der@@ n-@@ day win@@ e-@@ b@@ l@@ ush@@ ed G@@ re@@ ek sy@@ m@@ po@@ si@@ um encouraging the du@@ al p@@ ill@@ ars of c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ i@@ s@@ ation , free thinking and t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance .
Y@@ et , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ c@@ e@@ st@@ er College in the late E@@ ig@@ h@@ ties to read history , I 'd p@@ ack@@ ed my b@@ ags , pre@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ it@@ ating the first scandal of my life .
My father broke down and cried .
Friends were b@@ aff@@ led .
The Evening Standard diary claimed I 'd quit because I ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to fellow un@@ der@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ at@@ es having se@@ x in the room next to m@@ ine .
The writer A N Wil@@ son announced w@@ ag@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ly that I 'd de@@ par@@ ted because I was forced to drink out of chi@@ pped m@@ u@@ g@@ s .
The tr@@ ut@@ h was less dro@@ ll .
I ran away .
Yes , ran , because I had been subject to sy@@ st@@ em@@ at@@ i@@ c bul@@ l@@ y@@ ing and in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation .
Not on account of my rather ou@@ tr@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was per@@ se@@ c@@ ut@@ ed for one reason only , and in this c@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ le of su@@ p@@ posed en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment it was both b@@ ig@@ o@@ ted and bar@@ bar@@ ic : my father , the late W@@ oo@@ dro@@ w Wy@@ att , was a high-profile ad@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ er to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ative su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ter .
W@@ h@@ y bring this up now , you might ask .
Well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of R@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ -@@ o@@ f@@ -@@ centre students are su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing a similar per@@ se@@ c@@ u@@ ti@@ on .
Such is the in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed and increasing h@@ at@@ red of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ed the same e@@ qu@@ al-@@ rights protection as g@@ ay@@ s , di@@ s@@ ab@@ led people and ethnic m@@ in@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ es .
Con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ative members of Cor@@ p@@ us Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ i College 's j@@ un@@ i@@ or common room ( J@@ C@@ R ) claim they are " often ac@@ tiv@@ ely i@@ s@@ ol@@ ated , personally attacked and made to feel un@@ welcome " because of their political vie@@ ws .
They want to create a post on the college 's e@@ qu@@ al op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es com@@ mit@@ tee to ensure that their opinions can be ai@@ red fre@@ ely .
Their situation wasn 't helped by a recent BBC Two doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ar@@ y , W@@ on@@ der@@ land : Young , B@@ right and on the R@@ ig@@ h@@ t , about student politics , which p@@ or@@ tra@@ y@@ ed Tor@@ ies as od@@ d@@ ball@@ s and ne@@ o-@@ N@@ a@@ z@@ is .
It fe@@ at@@ ured g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ ate Joe C@@ oo@@ k@@ e , former president of the Oxford University Con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ative Association ( O@@ U@@ CA ) , tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ing in a R@@ ol@@ l@@ s-@@ Ro@@ y@@ ce , sp@@ or@@ ting a s@@ il@@ ver su@@ it and s@@ il@@ v@@ er@@ -@@ t@@ op@@ p@@ ed can@@ e .
At other universities , Con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ative students say they are being treated as " sc@@ a@@ p@@ e@@ go@@ ats " for the introduction of higher tuition fees . "
L@@ u@@ k@@ e Black , 20 , vice-president of N@@ o@@ tt@@ in@@ g@@ ham University Con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing Le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ wing b@@ i@@ as at universities .
People assume we are like the Bul@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ don Club without meeting us . "
Samuel Ro@@ b@@ er@@ ts , 21 , a history student at Cor@@ p@@ us Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ i , who proposed the mo@@ ti@@ on for greater protection , says such a climate is " un@@ comfortable , " while S@@ te@@ ph@@ an@@ ie Ch@@ er@@ ill , 19 , president el@@ ec@@ t of O@@ U@@ CA , says there has been a de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ation in the attitude of J@@ C@@ R members towards people who are R@@ ig@@ h@@ t of centre .
" This po@@ s@@ es a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , " she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford .
I had gone up in September 1986 , a c@@ ri@@ p@@ pl@@ ingly sh@@ y 18@@ -year-old .
H@@ at@@ red of the Con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ative P@@ ar@@ ty was at its most f@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ ile .
The year before , the un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity had vo@@ ted to re@@ f@@ use Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an hon@@ or@@ ar@@ y degree , because of cuts in higher education f@@ un@@ ding .
The atmosphere would have made a St@@ al@@ in@@ ist sh@@ ud@@ der with a@@ p@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ on .
During the first few days of fresh@@ ers " week , when new students so@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ ise with each other and the d@@ on@@ s , I had a ta@@ st@@ e of the wor@@ m@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the d@@ on@@ s not only con@@ ni@@ v@@ ed in the ta@@ un@@ ting of Tory un@@ der@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ at@@ es but took part with rel@@ ish .
The politics of the m@@ in@@ ers " strike , pri@@ v@@ at@@ i@@ s@@ ation and the government 's opposition to sanctions against a@@ p@@ ar@@ th@@ e@@ i@@ d South Africa were brought into the w@@ oo@@ d@@ -@@ p@@ an@@ elled rooms of the t@@ ut@@ or@@ ial .
My first one involved trans@@ lat@@ ing 18@@ th-century French te@@ x@@ ts into English , and I was un@@ pre@@ p@@ a@@ red for what fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed .
" M@@ i@@ s@@ s Wy@@ att , " said the don , Harry P@@ it@@ t ( now de@@ c@@ eased ) , " p@@ le@@ as@@ e trans@@ late the first par@@ ag@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ h . "
I st@@ umbled over it .
A small man with a face like c@@ ak@@ e b@@ at@@ ter , P@@ it@@ t was big on b@@ ile .
" D@@ o Th@@ at@@ ch@@ er@@ it@@ es re@@ f@@ use to le@@ ar@@ n French or are they just st@@ u@@ p@@ id ? " he de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ed .
The other un@@ der@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ at@@ es g@@ ig@@ gled .
Te@@ ars pri@@ ck@@ ed the back of my eyes .
" I suggest you take some b@@ a@@ si@@ c French l@@ es@@ s@@ on@@ s in your sp@@ are time - that is , if you 're not too b@@ us@@ y so@@ c@@ i@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ing , " P@@ it@@ t s@@ n@@ ar@@ led .
I walked back to my rooms a di@@ s@@ con@@ sol@@ ate figure .
At d@@ in@@ ner in college that evening I s@@ at by myself ; then I felt a light ta@@ p on my shoulder .
It was a second-@@ year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ U@@ CA .
" I know who you are , " he said kin@@ d@@ ly .
I 'm af@@ r@@ a@@ id it 's like that .
An@@ y@@ one s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ ted of being a Tory is p@@ i@@ c@@ ked on .
It 's bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so it will be wor@@ se for you .
Most Tory fresh@@ ers pre@@ tend they 're L@@ ab@@ our .
L@@ ater , at a local pu@@ b , I c@@ r@@ a@@ ven@@ ly attempted to di@@ s@@ si@@ mul@@ ate .
I insisted that I didn 't agree with everything M@@ r@@ s Thatcher said .
This plo@@ y proved un@@ successful .
A first year P@@ P@@ E student , who , ir@@ on@@ ically , had been to E@@ ton , said : " You 're the daughter of a f@@ as@@ c@@ ist p@@ i@@ g . "
You 're contaminated .
Other students took up the re@@ f@@ r@@ a@@ in .
I was per@@ v@@ er@@ ted , dirty .
" How do Tor@@ ies have se@@ x ? " one asked .
They beat each other , don 't they ?
I felt the way h@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ se@@ x@@ u@@ als must have felt before the liber@@ al legislation of the S@@ i@@ x@@ ties .
W@@ ou@@ l@@ d I ever be able to lead a n@@ or@@ m@@ al life at Oxford ?
W@@ ou@@ l@@ d I be forced to meet li@@ k@@ e-@@ m@@ in@@ ded people only after dark ?
W@@ ou@@ l@@ d I have to turn to L@@ ab@@ our and su@@ p@@ press my natural inc@@ l@@ in@@ ations ?
The three years before me stretched out as a pur@@ g@@ at@@ or@@ y of o@@ str@@ ac@@ ism and i@@ s@@ ol@@ ation .
The only op@@ enly Tory don was Nor@@ man Stone , Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of Modern History , who was based at my college .
He was h@@ ated for being not only a Con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ative but a foreign policy ad@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ er to Thatcher and one of her speech writers .
He was har@@ d@@ ly ever there .
He lo@@ athed the place as provincial and p@@ e@@ t@@ ty , and for its ad@@ her@@ ence to the Mar@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ -@@ de@@ ter@@ m@@ in@@ ist view of history .
In 1997 he took up a p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or@@ ship at the University of B@@ il@@ k@@ ent , in An@@ kar@@ a , T@@ ur@@ key .
" You won 't be happy here , " he told me .
I began com@@ mut@@ ing from Oxford to my parents " h@@ ou@@ se in London , finding re@@ f@@ u@@ ge with my more op@@ en@@ -@@ m@@ in@@ ded m@@ e@@ t@@ ro@@ p@@ ol@@ it@@ an friends and family .
I told my father I h@@ ated Oxford and why .
He was inc@@ re@@ d@@ ul@@ ou@@ s .
During his time there in the For@@ ties , all political vie@@ ws had been accepted .
" But it 's the best place in the world , " he said p@@ a@@ th@@ e@@ tic@@ ally .
They w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't do that , not among my d@@ re@@ aming spi@@ res .
Even my Commun@@ ist friends always had im@@ p@@ ec@@ cable man@@ ners .
His r@@ h@@ e@@ um@@ y eyes began to cloud .
G@@ i@@ v@@ e it a chance .
I 'm sure it 's all just a te@@ as@@ e .
It would break my h@@ e@@ art if you left .
Ex@@ hau@@ sted by my fre@@ qu@@ ent trips to London , my emo@@ tional re@@ si@@ st@@ ance was de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ating .
A m@@ al@@ e friend of m@@ ine , also a Tory su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ter , had su@@ c@@ c@@ um@@ bed to pressure and ren@@ oun@@ c@@ ed his c@@ re@@ ed .
During a t@@ ut@@ or@@ ial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ n@@ ess , that I was an " en@@ em@@ y of the people , " I decided to do the same .
In@@ war@@ d@@ ly b@@ l@@ ush@@ ing with sh@@ am@@ e , I ad@@ mit@@ ted to being " brain@@ w@@ ashed by my parents " and called them " old fo@@ ol@@ s . "
The re@@ sp@@ it@@ e was short .
It was my father who drove the n@@ a@@ il into the co@@ f@@ f@@ in of my Oxford career .
At the time , he wrote two col@@ um@@ n@@ s in the Murdoch press each week .
My do@@ or was locked .
I co@@ w@@ er@@ ed inside , and after five minutes , my pur@@ su@@ ers gave up .
When they left , I p@@ ack@@ ed a su@@ it@@ case and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
You may call me a s@@ n@@ iv@@ ell@@ ing w@@ im@@ p .
But no 18@@ -year-old should be subject to such in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation and vit@@ ri@@ o@@ l in an e@@ du@@ c@@ ational in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on .
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers , but , to this day , hi@@ des behind an ill@@ -@@ des@@ er@@ v@@ ed re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation for equality and freedom of th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t .
" V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ o prefers el@@ e@@ g@@ an@@ ce to n@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ e@@ ty "
On the o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on of the " V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ o : M@@ ast@@ er of C@@ out@@ ure , " an exhibition that opened this week in London , ABC sp@@ e@@ ak@@ s with N@@ at@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal , F@@ i@@ on@@ a Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ -@@ B@@ or@@ ne@@ mis@@ z@@ a and other of the Italian des@@ ig@@ ner 's fam@@ ou@@ s clients .
S@@ o@@ m@@ er@@ set House , former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England , is the only place in the British capital wor@@ th@@ y of h@@ o@@ st@@ ing a V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ o Gar@@ av@@ ani exhibition .
During the in@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of " V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ o : M@@ ast@@ er of C@@ out@@ ure , " the des@@ ig@@ ner acknowledged a re@@ tro@@ spec@@ ti@@ v@@ e a@@ po@@ the@@ o@@ sis that brings together over 1@@ 30 c@@ out@@ ure g@@ ow@@ n@@ s created by his fashion h@@ ou@@ se over the past 50 years .

This exhibition is the c@@ ul@@ m@@ in@@ ation of a story whose only p@@ ro@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ ist is " si@@ gn@@ or@@ e " Gar@@ av@@ ani , although it could not have been w@@ r@@ it@@ ten without his distingu@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ed clients .
V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ o has always been f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ated by the r@@ a@@ re@@ fied and di@@ st@@ ant world of the n@@ o@@ b@@ ility .
In the first room of the exhibition , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of ar@@ i@@ st@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ acy , from Princ@@ ess S@@ al@@ im@@ ah A@@ g@@ a Khan , L@@ or@@ d S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ don , Princ@@ ess Mar@@ i@@ e@@ -@@ Ch@@ an@@ t@@ al of G@@ re@@ e@@ ce to Margaret of England .

" At least they don 't drop cigarette ends on your mag@@ n@@ ific@@ ent car@@ pet , like some beautiful po@@ p music c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ es do , " says Bar@@ on@@ ess F@@ i@@ on@@ a Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ -@@ B@@ or@@ ne@@ mis@@ z@@ a .

Nob@@ ility parade
Gar@@ av@@ ani 's life is not a story of ob@@ session , but of well re@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ro@@ c@@ ated love .

One of the S@@ o@@ m@@ er@@ set House g@@ all@@ er@@ ies has been trans@@ formed into a glamorous , six@@ t@@ y-@@ foot long cat@@ walk which offers a role re@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ al : visitors take the place of the mo@@ d@@ el@@ s and have to parade down the cat@@ walk while looking at a d@@ re@@ am " audience " wearing V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ o m@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ p@@ i@@ e@@ ces , for example , the dress Jackie Ken@@ ne@@ dy chose for her wedding with A@@ ri@@ st@@ o@@ t@@ le On@@ as@@ si@@ s , the co@@ st@@ um@@ e Monica V@@ it@@ ti wore in " L@@ a N@@ o@@ t@@ te " and the w@@ oo@@ l and le@@ a@@ th@@ er co@@ at that b@@ el@@ on@@ ged to E@@ m@@ press Far@@ ah Di@@ b@@ a .

Many of these clients say your first V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ o is like your first love , " im@@ possible to f@@ or@@ get . "
I remember it per@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ ly .
It was a pair of tro@@ us@@ ers , a sh@@ ir@@ t , a " g@@ il@@ et " wa@@ i@@ st@@ co@@ at and j@@ ack@@ et from the 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1-@@ 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 2 a@@ u@@ t@@ um@@ n-@@ winter collection .
" It was a gift he gave me " says N@@ at@@ y Ab@@ as@@ cal , one of the des@@ ig@@ ner 's m@@ us@@ es .
" I pre@@ fer him to other des@@ ign@@ ers because of his f@@ em@@ in@@ in@@ ity , his great love of women , and because he en@@ h@@ ances our beauty " added the former Du@@ ch@@ ess of F@@ er@@ ia .
I love the col@@ ours he us@@ es , they really st@@ and out and " l@@ end themselves " to your face .
Their p@@ ro@@ p@@ or@@ tions are per@@ f@@ ec@@ t .

As a teenager living in I@@ tal@@ y , I d@@ re@@ amed of re@@ a@@ ch@@ ing the age when I 'd have the chance to wear one of his evening g@@ ow@@ n@@ s ...
My time finally came in the late ' 9@@ 0@@ s .
I bought my first V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ o dress to wear at a party in the castle b@@ el@@ on@@ ging to my c@@ ou@@ s@@ in , Prince E@@ dou@@ ar@@ d de L@@ ig@@ n@@ e .
It was a red dress , with a f@@ r@@ il@@ ly sk@@ ir@@ t , dra@@ p@@ ed " cor@@ sage " and a stra@@ pl@@ ess ne@@ ck@@ line .
" It was a d@@ re@@ am come tru@@ e " says Princ@@ ess D '@@ Ar@@ en@@ berg , the wi@@ do@@ w of Ro@@ dri@@ go d '@@ Ar@@ en@@ berg .
" V@@ al@@ ent@@ in@@ o is in@@ different to fashion , his ob@@ session is tim@@ el@@ ess " says this Italian ar@@ i@@ st@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at who li@@ ves between Paris , New York and Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ i@@ res .
Princ@@ ess D '@@ Ar@@ en@@ berg looks after her c@@ ou@@ tur@@ ier g@@ ow@@ n@@ s with " the ut@@ most care ... because a dress not just a dress , it 's also the many m@@ em@@ or@@ ies that go with it . "

It took four months ' work and 25 " girls " ( as the des@@ ig@@ ner calls his se@@ am@@ st@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ es ) to create the pe@@ ar@@ l@@ -@@ en@@ cru@@ sted , i@@ v@@ or@@ y-@@ col@@ oured s@@ il@@ k g@@ own with tw@@ el@@ v@@ e different types of l@@ ace and a train four and a half m@@ e@@ t@@ res long .
According to journalist Su@@ z@@ y M@@ en@@ kes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion m@@ il@@ e@@ st@@ one of the late 20@@ th century , " the return of high society clients . "

The har@@ dest job in the world : the human mul@@ es of K@@ a@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en
For four e@@ u@@ ro@@ s , the Indonesian v@@ ol@@ can@@ o p@@ or@@ ters risk life and li@@ m@@ b carrying 70 k@@ il@@ os of sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r along st@@ e@@ ep stone p@@ a@@ th@@ s .
There are people for whom work is h@@ el@@ l , and others who - lit@@ er@@ ally - work in h@@ el@@ l .
This is the case of An@@ to Wi@@ j@@ aya , one of the 4@@ 00 m@@ in@@ ers who make their living taking sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r from the K@@ a@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en v@@ ol@@ can@@ o , east of the Indonesian i@@ s@@ land of J@@ av@@ a .
To do so , he has to des@@ c@@ end every day to the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m of the cr@@ ater , where the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ ro@@ us gas em@@ an@@ ating from the b@@ ow@@ els of the e@@ ar@@ th solidi@@ fi@@ es on con@@ t@@ act with air .
After breaking off large sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r ro@@ cks , which in to@@ t@@ al can w@@ e@@ i@@ gh up to 70 k@@ il@@ os , he carries them in two b@@ am@@ bo@@ o bas@@ k@@ ets on his sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s along the st@@ e@@ ep stone p@@ a@@ th@@ s .
It is only 2@@ 50 m@@ e@@ t@@ res to the top of the v@@ ol@@ can@@ o , which r@@ i@@ s@@ es to 2@@ ,@@ 3@@ 8@@ 6 m@@ e@@ t@@ res above sea level , but the exhausted p@@ or@@ ters take over 40 minutes to get there , at s@@ n@@ a@@ il 's pace , keeping their balance and m@@ e@@ as@@ uring their steps c@@ are@@ fully to avo@@ id sli@@ p@@ p@@ ing and f@@ all@@ ing over the pre@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ c@@ e .
They know that one sli@@ p could cost them their li@@ ves , as ha@@ p@@ p@@ en@@ ed to a French to@@ ur@@ ist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the ha@@ z@@ ard@@ ou@@ s K@@ a@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en cli@@ f@@ f@@ s .
The K@@ a@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en m@@ in@@ ers are paid 5 euro cents for each k@@ il@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r removed .
Once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like c@@ ir@@ c@@ us m@@ on@@ keys and then , lu@@ g@@ ging their heavy bas@@ k@@ ets , they walk three k@@ il@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res to the sc@@ ales in@@ st@@ all@@ ed by a m@@ in@@ ing company a little further down , 1,@@ 8@@ 50 m@@ e@@ t@@ res above sea level .
This is P@@ T N@@ g@@ ri@@ m@@ b@@ i C@@ an@@ d@@ i , a company which , since 1@@ 9@@ 60 , has been explo@@ it@@ ing the v@@ ol@@ can@@ o , and quite lit@@ er@@ ally its workers , whom it p@@ ay@@ s 6@@ 62 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 5 euro cents ) per k@@ il@@ o of sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r .
It then s@@ ells the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r for 10,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 83 cents ) to the p@@ e@@ t@@ ro@@ ch@@ em@@ ical industry , as the m@@ in@@ er@@ al is wi@@ d@@ ely used in everyday life and is used in the man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ t@@ ure of m@@ at@@ ches , fi@@ re@@ works , co@@ s@@ m@@ e@@ tic@@ s , d@@ yn@@ am@@ it@@ e and even for w@@ h@@ it@@ en@@ ing su@@ gar .
" We generally carry 70 k@@ il@@ os , so we get about 4@@ 6@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 3@@ .@@ 8 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s ) a trip " explains An@@ to , who usually make three trips a day .
Each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted , but it m@@ e@@ ans he gets 13@@ 8,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1@@ 1.@@ 5 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s ) at the end of the day .
Although it seems a p@@ it@@ t@@ ance for such an in@@ human effort , it is three times what he would e@@ ar@@ n in the field .
" Min@@ ers ' w@@ ag@@ es are very high here , w@@ h@@ er@@ e@@ as coffee har@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ing is paid 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1.@@ 2 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s ) a day and the average monthly w@@ age is two million ru@@ pe@@ es ( 16@@ 7 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s ) " explains the p@@ or@@ ter , who previously worked as a m@@ as@@ on in the i@@ s@@ land re@@ s@@ or@@ t of Bali .
There , his w@@ age was 7@@ 5,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 6.2 e@@ u@@ ro@@ s ) a day and the work was not as hard , but An@@ to has re@@ turned with his family to Ban@@ y@@ u@@ w@@ ang@@ i , a village near the v@@ ol@@ can@@ o , for a com@@ p@@ ell@@ ing reason which , in Indonesia , is as over@@ ri@@ ding as the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r : " I m@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed a g@@ ir@@ l from Bali , where they are Hindu , and I 've brought her to J@@ av@@ a to con@@ v@@ er@@ t to I@@ s@@ l@@ am . "
An@@ to has as@@ th@@ m@@ a , he has di@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ul@@ ty breathing , c@@ ou@@ gh@@ s con@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ ly and his eyes are ir@@ r@@ it@@ ated by the to@@ x@@ ic gases .
At 27 years old , An@@ to has been r@@ i@@ s@@ king his life for three years in the K@@ a@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en v@@ ol@@ can@@ o , and the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r has already begun to take its t@@ ol@@ l on him , even though he co@@ v@@ er@@ s his face with special m@@ ask and go@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ es .
He has as@@ th@@ m@@ a , he has di@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ul@@ ty breathing , c@@ ou@@ gh@@ s con@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ ly and his eyes are ir@@ r@@ it@@ ated by the to@@ x@@ ic gases from the v@@ ol@@ can@@ o .
This is the price you have to pay to real@@ ise your d@@ re@@ am@@ s .
" I 'll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French " he v@@ ows in more than acceptable English .
Pun@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ed for life , this p@@ le@@ as@@ ant , in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent young man could be a t@@ our g@@ u@@ i@@ de , wa@@ it@@ er or hotel recep@@ ti@@ on@@ ist , but instead he does the work of a m@@ u@@ le .
S@@ har@@ ing a fil@@ th@@ y w@@ oo@@ d@@ en h@@ u@@ t with other p@@ or@@ ters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r doesn 't stop f@@ lo@@ w@@ ing at night , when its char@@ ac@@ ter@@ istic y@@ el@@ low col@@ our turns blue and it g@@ lo@@ w@@ s in the dark .
De@@ f@@ y@@ ing the s@@ ha@@ d@@ ows , An@@ to des@@ c@@ ends the cr@@ ater and li@@ gh@@ ts the p@@ ath with a small t@@ or@@ ch att@@ a@@ ch@@ ed to the h@@ el@@ met he bought with his money .
Some 4@@ 00 p@@ or@@ ters carry sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r bas@@ k@@ ets on their sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s from the cr@@ ater .
Despite their huge profits , the m@@ in@@ ing company has not m@@ e@@ ch@@ an@@ ised the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r e@@ x@@ tr@@ action process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the p@@ or@@ ters , who work for themselves and by the k@@ il@@ o .
In fact , they do not even see any of the 30,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 2.@@ 5 euro ) per c@@ am@@ er@@ a s@@ ur@@ charge that , on top of the 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ e ( 1.@@ 2 euro ) entrance fe@@ e , the guards of this natural re@@ serve charge to tourists who come to photograph the v@@ ol@@ can@@ o and their human mul@@ es .
" This work is for animals , not people " protests Mad@@ r@@ us@@ in , a bur@@ ly 4@@ 2-@@ year p@@ or@@ ter who has been working at K@@ a@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en for three decades , since leaving school .
He can lift up to 1@@ 10 k@@ il@@ os , en@@ s@@ ur@@ ing that he will go on working " all he can " because he ne@@ e@@ ds the money to e@@ du@@ c@@ ate his three children , ag@@ ed between 18 [ months ? ] and 10 years old .
I won 't re@@ ti@@ re , I 'll die here because the v@@ ol@@ can@@ o has been my whole life .
Although the sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r bur@@ n@@ s your th@@ ro@@ at and st@@ ings your eyes when the w@@ ind suddenly changes and tra@@ ps the m@@ in@@ ers in the thick col@@ um@@ n@@ s of smoke coming out of the v@@ ol@@ can@@ o , they are so har@@ dy that no-@@ one com@@ pl@@ ain@@ s of serious ill@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ es ... a@@ p@@ art , of course , from their common re@@ sp@@ ir@@ at@@ or@@ y problems , o@@ st@@ e@@ o@@ ar@@ th@@ r@@ it@@ is , knee pain and so@@ res on the sh@@ oul@@ der@@ s , which have been mis@@ s@@ ha@@ p@@ en by the weight of the bas@@ k@@ ets .
B@@ al@@ anc@@ ing the bas@@ k@@ et on his back , Un@@ ain@@ ik can only carry 50 k@@ il@@ os now he is 5@@ 3 years old .
Every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 t@@ on@@ n@@ es of sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r from the v@@ ol@@ can@@ o , which three l@@ or@@ ries move to the w@@ are@@ h@@ ou@@ se in T@@ am@@ an@@ s@@ ari , 18 k@@ il@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res away along a go@@ at p@@ ath that passes through sc@@ rub@@ land .
" I won 't re@@ ti@@ re , I 'll die here because the v@@ ol@@ can@@ o has been my whole life " says Un@@ ain@@ ik , opening a m@@ ou@@ th full of g@@ a@@ p@@ s where teeth use to be .
The ol@@ dest of his five children , 30 years old , also works carrying sul@@ ph@@ u@@ r .
Time passes , but po@@ v@@ er@@ ty perpet@@ u@@ at@@ es from generation to generation in one of the har@@ dest jobs in the world : the one done by human mul@@ es in the K@@ a@@ wa@@ h I@@ j@@ en v@@ ol@@ can@@ o .
Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Sing@@ a@@ po@@ re@@ ans b@@ l@@ am@@ e their c@@ are@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children .
" Singapore 's population ne@@ e@@ ds to grow . "
I 'm a p@@ at@@ ri@@ o@@ tic husband , you 're my p@@ at@@ ri@@ o@@ tic wife , let 's do our c@@ i@@ vi@@ c d@@ ut@@ y and create life !
It may seem un@@ likely that these v@@ er@@ s@@ es are part of an ad@@ v@@ er@@ t for m@@ in@@ t swe@@ ets , but in sp@@ it@@ e of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went v@@ ir@@ al on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be in Singapore earlier this year .
The p@@ h@@ r@@ as@@ es are part of a r@@ a@@ p and make use of local re@@ fer@@ en@@ ces such as " Let 's put a b@@ a@@ o ( b@@ u@@ n ) in the o@@ v@@ en " to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore .
The advertising company that made the video , BB@@ H , is h@@ op@@ eful that the ad@@ v@@ er@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ em@@ ent will man@@ age to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
Its creative director , D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as Hamilton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their " national d@@ ut@@ y . "
It 's pu@@ re@@ ly an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and am@@ us@@ ing .
It 's the biggest problem facing this country .
We are the world 's worst at re@@ p@@ ro@@ du@@ c@@ ing our own p@@ ro@@ gen@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
We knew the Government had tried many things , like launching per@@ f@@ um@@ es with p@@ her@@ o@@ m@@ on@@ es or or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ing speed dating e@@ v@@ en@@ ings .
Many of these i@@ de@@ as may have been creative , but they didn 't necessarily work .
So we th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t : why not be as creative as possible to sol@@ v@@ e the problem , by com@@ po@@ s@@ ing a r@@ a@@ p ?
1.@@ 2 children
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so li@@ gh@@ t@@ ly .
It sp@@ ends US@@ D 1,@@ 300 per year on po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es to en@@ cour@@ age people to have more children .
A government p@@ ack@@ age for m@@ ar@@ ri@@ ag@@ es and parents grants up to US@@ D 15@@ ,000 per child , e@@ x@@ ten@@ ds m@@ at@@ ern@@ ity leave and di@@ stri@@ b@@ ut@@ es tax benefits .
But this has all had little effect .
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , also known for the conserv@@ atism of its leaders and its stri@@ c@@ t social controls .
The birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.@@ 2 children per woman .
The last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
So why are Sing@@ a@@ po@@ re@@ ans not having children ?
T@@ an We@@ i M@@ ing , Di@@ rec@@ tor of Mar@@ ri@@ age and Family Po@@ li@@ cy of the National Pop@@ ul@@ ation Division , said that it is a result of " better education " and " a wi@@ der range of career op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es . "
" This has given people a wi@@ der range of op@@ tions in terms of life go@@ als and pri@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ es , beyond getting m@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed and starting a family " he explains .
These changes in social n@@ or@@ ms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and b@@ ir@@ ths , which has resulted in a de@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ e in the birth rate in Singapore .
Me@@ an@@ while , an EU immigration policy aimed at d@@ r@@ am@@ at@@ i@@ c@@ ally increasing immigration to cop@@ e with the population decline has created re@@ s@@ ent@@ ment among the local population .
In Singapore , there are websites where x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ o@@ b@@ ia against many new immigrants is wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad and th@@ in@@ ly di@@ s@@ g@@ u@@ ised , especially the Chinese who are c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ised for keeping w@@ ag@@ es low and not in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ating .
In@@ c@@ re@@ ased immigration is also seen as one of the re@@ as@@ on@@ s why , last year , the Singapore r@@ ul@@ ing party e@@ x@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed its worst election result since independence .
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and le@@ vi@@ es for foreign workers .
U@@ ne@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ted con@@ sequ@@ en@@ ces
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation 's economic growth , tax re@@ ven@@ ues , healthcare costs and immigration po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es , in Singapore 's case there are also some unexpected con@@ sequ@@ en@@ ces .
The Government is trying not to build so many small h@@ ou@@ s@@ es .
For example , it has started to influence the real e@@ st@@ ate sector .
Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small a@@ p@@ art@@ ments , known as " sh@@ o@@ e bo@@ xes , " which can be built in certain areas of the city .
These a@@ p@@ art@@ ments have a surface of 46 square m@@ e@@ t@@ res and have been very successful in terms of sales .
However , there is concern that they may p@@ ro@@ mo@@ te a s@@ in@@ g@@ le@@ -@@ living lifestyle and di@@ s@@ cour@@ age developers who want to build large family h@@ ou@@ s@@ es .
But , L@@ im Ye@@ w S@@ o@@ on , man@@ ag@@ ing director of the real e@@ st@@ ate company E@@ L De@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ers , says his " sh@@ o@@ e bo@@ xes " sell much faster than larger units .
They are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
This m@@ e@@ ans they are much better for our cash flow .
However , he ad@@ m@@ its that the new re@@ g@@ ul@@ ations give c@@ le@@ ar@@ er g@@ u@@ id@@ ance to developers , who previously had ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
T@@ o@@ o stressed
Singapore is a city State .
Although these new r@@ ul@@ es may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Sing@@ a@@ po@@ re@@ ans working in the central financial di@@ stri@@ c@@ t , it seems they will not have much impact .
" People are very stressed , h@@ ou@@ s@@ es are e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family " says a young executive .
Other people can have children .
" But , for me , it is important to have my own money and time " says another young man of around 20 years old .
Men and women alike men@@ ti@@ on their c@@ are@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education as the re@@ as@@ on@@ s pre@@ vent@@ ing them from having children .
So , much as the Government is trying to en@@ cour@@ age its citizens to have children , when it comes to babies , the Sing@@ a@@ po@@ re@@ ans have the last word .
What is private off@@ line is private online
Priv@@ acy .
According to the Spanish Royal A@@ c@@ a@@ de@@ my D@@ i@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ar@@ y , it m@@ e@@ ans the quality of private life or " the level of privacy which a person is ent@@ it@@ led to protect from any inter@@ fer@@ ence . "
What is privacy for an under 16 ?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ?
D@@ o they understand the d@@ ang@@ ers they are e@@ x@@ posed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share off@@ line ?
El@@ P@@ er@@ i@@ ó@@ di@@ c@@ o inter@@ vie@@ wed five children ag@@ ed between ten and 15 years old who are fre@@ qu@@ ent Internet us@@ ers .
In four cases , they associated the term with " something very much m@@ ine " on a per@@ s@@ on@@ al level , and " in the us@@ er name and pass@@ word " when app@@ li@@ ed to social networks .
" I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't u@@ p@@ lo@@ ad my de@@ ep@@ est se@@ c@@ re@@ ts in a post " says J@@ or@@ ge , ag@@ ed ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Fac@@ e@@ b@@ oo@@ k , T@@ w@@ it@@ ter , Ho@@ t@@ mail and Windows Li@@ v@@ e Messen@@ ger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
" They are very secret se@@ c@@ re@@ ts , I 'll tell my mother , but not e@@ very@@ body " he says .
On F@@ B I u@@ p@@ lo@@ ad nice pictures or games .
And I have fun with people I know .
" I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't share a p@@ h@@ o@@ to that isn 't m@@ ine , or that b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ s to s@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ dy who 's doing something st@@ u@@ p@@ id " he says .
The child re@@ co@@ gn@@ i@@ s@@ es that it is bad to post ob@@ scene pictures of n@@ aked people , crimes , or write h@@ um@@ ili@@ ating or aggressive comments .
J@@ or@@ ge says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine fol@@ lo@@ wers on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter .
Most are relatives .
His mother is included , and she has the pass@@ word to one of the accounts .
I opened T@@ w@@ it@@ ter to e@@ x@@ press myself and post inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing t@@ w@@ e@@ ets .
" I don 't know if they answer me , I only u@@ p@@ lo@@ ad them " he adds .
" S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al net@@ working is fun , I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends " he says .
He does not h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to reply that he would never accept a request from an un@@ k@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ n person .
N@@ or would he take any notice of someone who re@@ com@@ men@@ ds a st@@ r@@ an@@ ger to him .
The case of Joseph , ag@@ ed 14 , is different .
This teenager has accounts with Ho@@ t@@ mail , Fac@@ e@@ b@@ oo@@ k , My Space and Ask , and in the last case he ad@@ m@@ its not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
" It doesn 't bo@@ th@@ er me , because we have something in common , like music " he says .
The boy says that no-@@ one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
" If they pre@@ s@@ su@@ red me or asked me for it , I 'd just d@@ el@@ e@@ te them from my account " he states .
Joseph became a fol@@ lo@@ w@@ er on Ask , after reading a re@@ com@@ men@@ d@@ ation on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter .
This teenager is not al@@ i@@ en to e@@ x@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ ces of what is now known as c@@ y@@ b@@ er@@ bul@@ l@@ y@@ ing .
An ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ t@@ ance of a friend of m@@ ine was being p@@ e@@ st@@ ered on a social network .
They were threatening him and de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ing money from him .
" I never found out who it was " he says .
The victim , according to J@@ o@@ s@@ é , did not close his account .
" He just made it private . "
He then explains a series of steps to con@@ figure the account sa@@ f@@ ely .
Un@@ like J@@ or@@ ge , this boy would u@@ p@@ lo@@ ad photos of ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces in un@@ comfortable or em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ s@@ ing s@@ it@@ u@@ ations .
I would do it if I didn 't like s@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ dy , or they made me want to do it .
" However , I know that 's c@@ y@@ b@@ er@@ bul@@ l@@ y@@ ing " he ad@@ m@@ its .
Key questions
Mar@@ i@@ el@@ os P@@ or@@ r@@ as , an English teacher with a degree in E@@ du@@ c@@ ation and Le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing , believes that to g@@ u@@ i@@ de children and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers , they should understand that the pur@@ po@@ se of social media is to in@@ form .
" The Internet em@@ er@@ g@@ ed as a m@@ e@@ ans of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the r@@ ul@@ es of the game changed " he says .
P@@ or@@ r@@ as says the s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ar Mar@@ c P@@ ren@@ sky , with a M@@ ast@@ er 's degree in E@@ du@@ c@@ ation from Y@@ al@@ e University and a@@ u@@ th@@ or of the work D@@ ig@@ it@@ al N@@ at@@ i@@ ves , D@@ ig@@ it@@ al Im@@ mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts , co@@ in@@ ed these terms to explain the ph@@ en@@ o@@ m@@ en@@ on .
D@@ ig@@ it@@ al n@@ at@@ i@@ ves are those children and young people bor@@ n with technology .
" We are the di@@ g@@ it@@ al immigrants who have to te@@ a@@ ch them , when we are still in fact le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing " he says .
He says that the issue is complex , " because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appro@@ pri@@ ate or not to di@@ sc@@ lose , p@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ ish or di@@ v@@ ul@@ ge , at an age at which m@@ at@@ ur@@ ity is not con@@ du@@ c@@ i@@ v@@ e to this . "
" They also have to be s@@ el@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ e when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the con@@ sequ@@ en@@ ces " he adds .
According to the specialist , the most effective way to te@@ a@@ ch children and te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
" T@@ ell@@ ing them not to do it is no good " he adds .
P@@ or@@ r@@ as then lists some op@@ tions : There are things you w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't tell a st@@ r@@ an@@ ger , so why do it online ?
Or , would you like a friend to p@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ ish a p@@ h@@ o@@ to of you like the one you posted of a friend ?
D@@ o you know what others p@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ ish about you ?
When t@@ ag@@ ging party photos , did you ask the other people 's per@@ mission to tag them ?
And one more question : does everyone need to know what you 're doing all the time ?
Another point is to make them see that they must be@@ have online as they do off@@ line .
The r@@ ul@@ es are the same .
" Outside the Internet , people act with respect , m@@ or@@ ality and other p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , so they should act the same way on social networks " he says .
Mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing
St@@ u@@ art Guard , a un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or , primary school teacher and e@@ du@@ c@@ ational consultant , says it is es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al for parents to read social networks ' po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
By understanding all the cl@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ es , they have so@@ li@@ d gro@@ un@@ ds to talk to their children about the im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations of opening an online account .
" For example , the age at which you are allowed to share or p@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ ish " he says .
According to Guar@@ dia , it is important to re@@ mind children the " don 't talk to st@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ ers " lesson .
Un@@ as@@ u@@ r Summit c@@ lo@@ s@@ es without making public the L@@ im@@ a Dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation
The S@@ i@@ x@@ th Pre@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( Un@@ as@@ u@@ r ) concluded today in Peru without making public the L@@ im@@ a Dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation , previously announced and the@@ o@@ re@@ tic@@ ally signed by the seven at@@ ten@@ de@@ e leaders .
E@@ f@@ e repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the S@@ i@@ x@@ th U@@ N@@ AS@@ U@@ R Me@@ e@@ t@@ ing of H@@ e@@ ads of State and Government , but Pre@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al and Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ er@@ y so@@ ur@@ ces initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an Government website .
When asked about the te@@ x@@ t , they po@@ in@@ ted out that the content had been di@@ sc@@ lo@@ s@@ ed by Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an President , O@@ l@@ l@@ an@@ t@@ a H@@ um@@ al@@ a , during a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f statement to the press .
J@@ o@@ ur@@ n@@ al@@ ists ' access to information from the Summit was re@@ stri@@ c@@ ted at all times .
During the summit , in the press room , only video was ai@@ red , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the m@@ es@@ s@@ age " closed session , audio re@@ stri@@ c@@ ted . "
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press sp@@ o@@ k@@ es@@ men of some of the U@@ N@@ AS@@ U@@ R governments at@@ ten@@ ding the meeting , but not the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an Government .
The only document released during the summit was the list of at@@ ten@@ ding pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent@@ s , which an@@ ger@@ ed hundreds of journal@@ ists from v@@ ar@@ ious national and international media , who asked for more details .
The Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an President then sent an em@@ a@@ il to the media with the " final statement " of the summit , but this was H@@ um@@ al@@ a 's statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
Last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South A@@ mer@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Arab Countries ( A@@ S@@ P@@ A ) , and this time , despite re@@ pe@@ ated re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s from the press , the previously announced L@@ im@@ a Dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ation was again not made public .
The A@@ S@@ P@@ A official website con@@ f@@ ir@@ ms that the document was published last Tuesday .
At both international events , the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an authorities were at p@@ ain@@ s to ensure that there were broadcasting systems as@@ su@@ red for all the journal@@ ists , but limited the ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ing of information to a m@@ a@@ xim@@ um .
The summit also concluded with the joint com@@ mit@@ ment of Ch@@ ile and Peru to accept a r@@ ul@@ ing by the H@@ ag@@ ue Court to ad@@ ju@@ di@@ c@@ ate a border disp@@ ute between the two countries .
The Pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent@@ s of Peru , O@@ l@@ l@@ an@@ t@@ a H@@ um@@ al@@ a , and Ch@@ ile , S@@ e@@ b@@ ast@@ i@@ á@@ n P@@ i@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The H@@ ag@@ ue , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the law@@ su@@ it L@@ im@@ a has filed against S@@ an@@ ti@@ ago .
" We will o@@ be@@ y and e@@ x@@ ec@@ ute the order that currently de@@ fin@@ es the differences we are bringing before this international court " said H@@ um@@ al@@ a , together with his Chil@@ ean counterpart .
" Ch@@ ile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disp@@ ut@@ es , tre@@ at@@ i@@ es and international courts " added P@@ i@@ ñ@@ era , g@@ re@@ e@@ t@@ ing H@@ um@@ al@@ a with a h@@ an@@ d@@ s@@ ha@@ k@@ e , al@@ on@@ g@@ side the f@@ l@@ ags of the two countries .
Con@@ f@@ ir@@ m@@ ation of both pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent@@ s that they would submit to the IC@@ J came after Col@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ia this week den@@ oun@@ c@@ ed the Bo@@ go@@ t@@ á P@@ act , w@@ h@@ er@@ e@@ by it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its m@@ ar@@ it@@ im@@ e boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously f@@ law@@ ed .
The summit was held with the absence of the Pre@@ si@@ d@@ ent@@ s of B@@ r@@ a@@ z@@ il , Dil@@ m@@ a R@@ ou@@ s@@ se@@ f@@ f ; Venezuela , Hu@@ go Chavez ; Bolivia , E@@ v@@ o Morales ; and Argentina , C@@ ri@@ st@@ in@@ a Kir@@ ch@@ ner .
P@@ ar@@ ag@@ u@@ ay , which was suspended by U@@ N@@ AS@@ U@@ R in 20@@ 11 after the di@@ s@@ mis@@ s@@ al of former President Fernando L@@ u@@ go , was not involved in the meeting .
Ho@@ s@@ t President O@@ l@@ l@@ an@@ t@@ a H@@ um@@ al@@ a was responsible for opening the session in the morning and c@@ lo@@ s@@ ing the summit , just after noon in L@@ im@@ a .
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans la@@ id down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a to@@ t@@ al of 17 billion dollars of investments .
Among the re@@ solutions adopted , it was mentioned that U@@ N@@ AS@@ U@@ R countries will take " important steps toward the goal of a South American c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ ship , for which re@@ si@@ den@@ ce agreements are being extended . "
He reported that actions are being implemented to improve " cooperation in the fight against in@@ security and trans@@ national or@@ g@@ an@@ ised crime , actions to make m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ation more ac@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ble , low-cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal jo@@ in@@ t@@ ly and efficiently with risks of natural di@@ sa@@ st@@ ers . "
With Europe in crisis , " economic con@@ so@@ li@@ d@@ ation ( in Latin America ) should not have a tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ ist attitude but should serve to expand its p@@ ro@@ du@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ e m@@ at@@ ri@@ x and g@@ li@@ mp@@ se a better future for its people " H@@ um@@ al@@ a added .
" We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in r@@ ur@@ al and border areas ... un@@ it@@ ing our countries and creating new economic networks " said the Per@@ u@@ vi@@ an President in a m@@ es@@ s@@ age read out .
Among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the trans@@ verse a@@ xes of its ter@@ r@@ it@@ or@@ y , between the coast and B@@ r@@ a@@ z@@ il , and two focus on increased connection with E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or , although he gave no further details .
Also , the final document mentioned the political situation in P@@ ar@@ ag@@ u@@ ay .
" We hope the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al process in that country serves to re@@ inc@@ or@@ p@@ or@@ ate it in the Union of South American Nations , " from which it is currently e@@ x@@ c@@ lu@@ ded .
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous , peaceful and in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ated nation , with good n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ ly relations , was another issue high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted by the summit .
In this sense , the President of Col@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ia , Ju@@ an M@@ an@@ u@@ el San@@ to@@ s , said before at@@ ten@@ ding the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua , Daniel Or@@ te@@ ga , on Saturday in Mexico , to re@@ spec@@ t@@ fully discuss the m@@ ar@@ it@@ im@@ e disp@@ ute after the failure of the IC@@ J , questioned by Bo@@ go@@ t@@ a .
" The day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Or@@ te@@ ga " San@@ to@@ s said .
" We will re@@ view all these p@@ a@@ th@@ s , [ which ] are not exclusive , and the tre@@ at@@ y with Nicaragua will re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e a con@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ation with Nicaragua " he emph@@ as@@ ised .
" With President Or@@ te@@ ga , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most c@@ i@@ v@@ il@@ ised and re@@ spec@@ t@@ ful man@@ ner possible " said San@@ to@@ s .
San@@ to@@ s and Or@@ te@@ ga are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the in@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of the country 's new President , En@@ ri@@ que Pe@@ ñ@@ a N@@ i@@ e@@ to .
Also , as part of the summit , the blo@@ c 's foreign def@@ ence ministers met in advance to appro@@ v@@ e the 20@@ 13 A@@ ction Plan , which seeks to str@@ eng@@ then di@@ alogue and consensus on def@@ ence in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Col@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ia , E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or , Peru , B@@ r@@ a@@ z@@ il , U@@ ru@@ g@@ u@@ ay , Venezuela , Ch@@ ile , G@@ u@@ y@@ ana , Sur@@ in@@ am and P@@ ar@@ ag@@ u@@ ay make up U@@ N@@ AS@@ U@@ R , although the latter is currently suspended .
Peru has the pro te@@ m@@ p@@ or@@ e pre@@ si@@ den@@ cy of the regional blo@@ c .
" South America should le@@ ar@@ n from Europe to integrate c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ ship " says Raf@@ a@@ el Cor@@ rea
The President of E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or , Raf@@ a@@ el Cor@@ rea , said today that the c@@ re@@ ation of a common c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ ship is a goal that " South America , in this case , must le@@ ar@@ n from Europe . "
Cor@@ rea , who took part in the E@@ le@@ vent@@ h Pre@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( U@@ N@@ AS@@ U@@ R ) held in L@@ im@@ a , told Peru 's state television that E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans " killed one another in the S@@ e@@ con@@ d World W@@ ar " and other conflicts , " but are now p@@ r@@ ac@@ tic@@ ally one country . "
To this end , he def@@ ended the project to establish South American c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ ship en@@ cour@@ ag@@ ed by member countries of U@@ N@@ AS@@ U@@ R .
" We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the An@@ de@@ an Commun@@ ity . However , there are still re@@ ac@@ ti@@ on@@ ar@@ y se@@ c@@ tors that want us to return to the past " he said .
The E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or@@ ian President was also in favour of the re@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tur@@ ing of the Or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation of American States ( O@@ AS ) under the pre@@ mis@@ e of reducing the influence of the An@@ g@@ lo@@ -S@@ a@@ x@@ on states and taking into account those who have signed the P@@ act of San J@@ o@@ s@@ é on human rights .
Those who speak with authority never com@@ m@@ it to anything , w@@ h@@ er@@ e@@ as we South Americans sign everything .
" It is in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble that the In@@ ter@@ -@@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US f@@ un@@ ding " he said referring to E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or giving political as@@ y@@ l@@ um to W@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s founder Ju@@ li@@ an A@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ ge .
Cor@@ rea said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not be@@ tra@@ y@@ ed his p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es , but has re@@ sp@@ ec@@ ted his " deep de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c and human rights v@@ al@@ ues . "
He added that , at the time , " he had reasonable suspicion that A@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ ge would be e@@ x@@ tra@@ d@@ it@@ ed to another country and that his case would not be re@@ sp@@ ec@@ ted . "
Ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally , he c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ised the S@@ w@@ e@@ di@@ s@@ h courts for de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ing that he be subject to questioning for an alleged se@@ x@@ ual off@@ ence in his country , when " S@@ w@@ e@@ di@@ s@@ h legislation itself di@@ c@@ t@@ at@@ es that he can be questioned vi@@ a vi@@ de@@ o@@ conference , which could be done from the E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or@@ ian E@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y in London . "
Cor@@ rea said that there is a risk of de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ation of A@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ ge 's physical and mental health .
" I have not sp@@ o@@ ken to him since he was at our em@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y , but the am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or in@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ed me that he had a m@@ in@@ or l@@ un@@ g problem , nothing serious " said the E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or@@ ian President .
What there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ate due to being locked in a small sp@@ ace without any out@@ do@@ or exercise .
" That would com@@ p@@ lic@@ ate the health of any person " he added .
Cor@@ rea said that the solution to the as@@ y@@ l@@ um granted to A@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ ge in June by the E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or@@ ian E@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y , in London , through the issue of a sa@@ fe@@ -@@ conduct pass that per@@ m@@ its travel to E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or , is in the hands of Great Britain , S@@ w@@ e@@ d@@ en and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the im@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ ment of the W@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ Le@@ ak@@ s founder .
We do not ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions .
" The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , S@@ w@@ e@@ d@@ en and the European legal authorities , because A@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ ge 's lawyer , B@@ al@@ ta@@ z@@ ar Gar@@ z@@ on , is h@@ an@@ d@@ ling a series of cases in different European courts " he said .
And he felt that " if Britain says no to the sa@@ fe@@ -@@ conduct pass , it 's over . "
And if S@@ w@@ e@@ d@@ en , as its legislation per@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ ly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr A@@ s@@ s@@ an@@ ge at the E@@ m@@ b@@ as@@ s@@ y of E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or in London , or inter@@ ro@@ g@@ at@@ es him vi@@ a Sk@@ y@@ p@@ e tomorrow , this problem is over .
Cor@@ rea took the opportunity to re@@ as@@ s@@ er@@ t himself as a def@@ en@@ der of freedom of the press and st@@ ated that what he does not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate is " the medi@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ ity , di@@ sh@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ y and li@@ es that undermine the freedom of expression . "
" The greatest en@@ em@@ ies of the press freedom are not evi@@ l and w@@ i@@ c@@ ked p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans , but bad journal@@ ists de@@ p@@ en@@ ding on profit , b@@ l@@ ack@@ mail and e@@ x@@ t@@ or@@ ti@@ on " he said .
In that re@@ g@@ ar@@ d , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journal@@ ists , " or the b@@ an@@ k@@ ers or bo@@ ur@@ g@@ e@@ o@@ is and h@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ m@@ on@@ ic countries that d@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ate E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or " and said that , if re-@@ elected , he will " step up the re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on to continue on the same p@@ ath and in the right direction . "
Cor@@ rea also su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted the decision to maintain the veto on P@@ ar@@ ag@@ u@@ ay in U@@ N@@ AS@@ U@@ R , at least until their next elections , ar@@ g@@ u@@ ing that the body " must be firm and not t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate op@@ port@@ un@@ ism and a c@@ ou@@ p m@@ asked with le@@ g@@ ality " because this will in fact " de@@ st@@ ro@@ y the le@@ g@@ it@@ im@@ acy of P@@ ar@@ ag@@ u@@ ay@@ an de@@ mo@@ cr@@ acy . "
The E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or@@ ian President also considered the " per@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ ly per@@ t@@ in@@ ent " des@@ ir@@ e of his Col@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ian counterpart , Ju@@ an M@@ an@@ u@@ el San@@ to@@ s , to now ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate with Nicaragua the m@@ ar@@ it@@ im@@ e boundary between the two countries , after the r@@ ul@@ ing of the International Court of Justice in The H@@ ag@@ ue , in favour N@@ i@@ c@@ ar@@ ag@@ u@@ an m@@ ar@@ it@@ im@@ e so@@ v@@ er@@ e@@ i@@ gn@@ ty .
For now that r@@ ul@@ ing is not being fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed .
It is a problem between a South American country and a Centr@@ al American one .
Con@@ fli@@ c@@ t is in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able , but must be overcome by the des@@ ir@@ e to walk together .
They need to be p@@ ro@@ c@@ essed in a comprehensive man@@ ner to overcome them and move forward .
Ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally , he tru@@ sted in a sound conclusion to the m@@ ar@@ it@@ im@@ e boundary disp@@ ute op@@ po@@ s@@ ing Peru and Ch@@ ile in the same court and said that " it is right for Latin America to re@@ fer to international courts if both countries agree to accept lo@@ s@@ ing , however hard it may be . "
With reference to the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ility of his standing as a candidate in the u@@ p@@ coming presidential elections in E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or seeking a third consecutive term , he said he se@@ es that po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ility " with much optimism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . "
Cor@@ rea said that if he lo@@ s@@ es the elections in February 20@@ 13 , he will re@@ ti@@ re from public life .
Per@@ s@@ on@@ ally , I 've never been interested in power , but in s@@ it@@ u@@ ations as un@@ just as those in E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or , so@@ c@@ i@@ o-@@ economic po@@ v@@ er@@ ty can only be cor@@ rec@@ ted by political power .
" My political movement believed that it was me who en@@ su@@ red that p@@ ro@@ b@@ able victory , so we have to accept that re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility " he said .
If I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life .
If I lose , li@@ ke@@ w@@ ise .
" It 's a decision " he confirmed .
Cor@@ rea also re@@ fer@@ red to V@@ en@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ an President Hu@@ go Chavez 's new health treatment in C@@ u@@ b@@ a .
I just spoke with V@@ en@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ an Vice President N@@ i@@ c@@ ol@@ á@@ s Mad@@ ur@@ o and he t@@ ells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to C@@ u@@ b@@ a .
" This does not mean a health rel@@ a@@ p@@ se for President Chavez " he said .
In L@@ im@@ a today , the E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or@@ ian H@@ e@@ ad of State attended the S@@ i@@ x@@ th Summit of H@@ e@@ ads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( U@@ N@@ AS@@ U@@ R ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ation to su@@ st@@ a@@ in progress , equality and security .
De@@ a@@ th@@ s caused by AIDS are n@@ o@@ w@@ ad@@ ay@@ s due to late de@@ te@@ ction
F@@ ab@@ ri@@ z@@ i@@ o was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HI@@ V po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e .
" It was like a bomb dropped on me " he says , recalling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make " so@@ f@@ ter , " a@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly un@@ successfully .
The boy h@@ id it from his family .
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to le@@ ar@@ n about it ; th@@ an@@ ks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 43@@ r@@ d birthday .
He is undoub@@ te@@ d@@ ly one of the ol@@ dest patients in the HI@@ V Un@@ it of the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara Ci@@ vi@@ l Hospital ( CH@@ G ) , where he arrived in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 after several b@@ att@@ l@@ es with his health .
F@@ ab@@ ri@@ z@@ i@@ o has lived with the human im@@ m@@ un@@ o@@ def@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ cy v@@ ir@@ us ( HI@@ V ) for 22 years , hard to im@@ ag@@ ine in the early ' 9@@ 0@@ s , when there were many questions , few treatment op@@ tions and a great deal of st@@ ig@@ m@@ a .
Th@@ en , even the director of an I@@ M@@ S@@ S [ M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Security Institute ] c@@ l@@ in@@ ic refused to di@@ s@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge him " because he had a cut . "
At that time , having A@@ ids was sy@@ n@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ou@@ s with death .
Now it is possible to survive the syn@@ dro@@ me and do so with quality of life .
However , many people are still un@@ aw@@ are of their illness , and only seek help when the v@@ ir@@ us has already caused ha@@ vo@@ c , " exhausted " their im@@ m@@ un@@ e systems and they are su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing from op@@ port@@ un@@ istic in@@ f@@ ections .
31 years after of the on@@ set of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , " the great achievement at this time is that the life e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ tan@@ cy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ tan@@ cy of the general population is exactly e@@ qu@@ al " st@@ ated the head of the CH@@ G HI@@ V Un@@ it , J@@ a@@ im@@ e An@@ dra@@ de V@@ ill@@ an@@ u@@ e@@ v@@ a , saying that this information was en@@ d@@ or@@ s@@ ed in April this year in a prestigious s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c jo@@ ur@@ n@@ al .
In@@ f@@ ec@@ ti@@ ou@@ s disease specialist and expert in HI@@ V / AIDS , An@@ dra@@ de V@@ ill@@ an@@ u@@ e@@ v@@ a said that since 2008 s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ st@@ s had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ tan@@ cy and quality of life de@@ p@@ end on the degree of damage to the im@@ m@@ un@@ e system that patients present when they are di@@ ag@@ n@@ o@@ s@@ ed , with a higher life e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ tan@@ cy for n@@ on-@@ drug us@@ ers : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 C@@ D@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 C@@ D@@ 4 count .
In simple terms , this m@@ e@@ ans that anyone di@@ ag@@ n@@ o@@ s@@ ed HI@@ V po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e at 25 years old , under these terms and " as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 " said the inter@@ vie@@ w@@ e@@ e .
To g@@ a@@ u@@ ge this progress , it should be re@@ m@@ em@@ b@@ er@@ ed that the average life e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ tan@@ cy of M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ans today is 7@@ 6 years .
Although m@@ or@@ t@@ ality has dropped si@@ gn@@ ific@@ an@@ t@@ ly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people d@@ y@@ ing of AIDS has f@@ all@@ en from 6@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4@@ ,@@ 8@@ 62 in 20@@ 11 ( U@@ N@@ AIDS annual report ) , it is also tru@@ e that since the ad@@ v@@ ent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
In J@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ co alone , only 25@@ 5 people died in 20@@ 11 , and there have been 18@@ 7 de@@ a@@ th@@ s up to May of this year ; however , we are as@@ su@@ red that there has been universal access to an@@ ti@@ re@@ tro@@ v@@ ir@@ al drugs since 2005 .
- W@@ h@@ y are do still de@@ a@@ th@@ s o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ r ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment .
That 's how I view it , and that 's how it 's been at our hospital .
For at least the last 12 years we 've had no short@@ age of m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are un@@ aw@@ are of their HI@@ V status , that is to say , the later st@@ ag@@ es of the disease .
He gave a com@@ p@@ ell@@ ing st@@ at@@ i@@ st@@ ic : " N@@ ine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an op@@ port@@ un@@ istic infection , so what ne@@ e@@ ds to be done to have a greater impact on overall m@@ or@@ t@@ ality is to make earlier di@@ ag@@ n@@ o@@ s@@ es and , therefore , offer m@@ ass de@@ te@@ ction tests for everyone who ne@@ e@@ ds them . "
Sp@@ ec@@ i@@ alists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Pre@@ ven@@ ti@@ on in J@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ co ( CO@@ E@@ S@@ I@@ D@@ A ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as F@@ ab@@ ri@@ z@@ i@@ o , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered K@@ a@@ po@@ s@@ i s@@ ar@@ com@@ a , a c@@ anc@@ er@@ ou@@ s t@@ um@@ our that is one of the common complications .
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
Some people think they 're going to die and don 't want to know anything .
" If I 'm going to die , I 'd rather have a b@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ out three times a week " they say , but not in my case .
The change was for the better ; I e@@ at well , I exercise , I take my drugs .
To date , his parents are only aw@@ are he had cancer .
I live as n@@ or@@ m@@ al a life as anyone else .
" I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible se@@ x life , I take care of myself and the other person " said F@@ ab@@ ri@@ z@@ i@@ o , who agreed to share his in@@ tim@@ ate se@@ c@@ re@@ ts with M@@ I@@ LE@@ N@@ I@@ O J@@ AL@@ I@@ S@@ C@@ O , to mo@@ tiv@@ ate those people with his story who today , in the con@@ te@@ x@@ t of World AIDS Day , are af@@ r@@ a@@ id .
They should get tested if they are at r@@ i@@ s@@ k@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HI@@ V po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e , the better , and if they have already been di@@ ag@@ n@@ o@@ s@@ ed , they must le@@ ar@@ n to live like any other person , while being responsible .
This is his m@@ es@@ s@@ age , which su@@ m@@ m@@ ar@@ i@@ s@@ es the th@@ em@@ e of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
Con@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s behind the counter .
The g@@ a@@ p@@ s between health p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es and ordin@@ ar@@ y citizens are huge , said Ric@@ ar@@ do S@@ al@@ a@@ z@@ ar , a journalist from G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara who has taken up the HI@@ V cause .
And the greatest c@@ ure is prevention .
In plac@@ es dedicated to this t@@ ask " the di@@ stri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on of con@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us p@@ ack@@ ets of a hundred , and that 's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access con@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s " he said .
Among the most vulnerable to new in@@ f@@ ections are te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers .
" W@@ h@@ y do you want them ? " is a common question , asked with s@@ ar@@ c@@ as@@ m and j@@ ud@@ ged according to the v@@ al@@ ues of social workers , co@@ un@@ s@@ ell@@ ors , ph@@ ar@@ m@@ acy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to e@@ x@@ po@@ se te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers to se@@ x , said the speaker .
It was decided to change such in@@ eff@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ent allocation , and that con@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s should not only be plac@@ ed behind co@@ un@@ ters , but that p@@ ack@@ ets of one hundred should be found in public to@@ il@@ et disp@@ en@@ s@@ ers in plac@@ es fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ed by young people .
This is not promoting p@@ ro@@ mis@@ c@@ u@@ ity .
It is not about paying for their be@@ ers or mo@@ te@@ l fees , as Go@@ v@@ er@@ n@@ or E@@ m@@ ili@@ o G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z said , when asked if there would be di@@ stri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on of con@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s during his administration .
" And it 's not about se@@ x@@ u@@ ality , but it is best to provide con@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s to those already p@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ ing se@@ x@@ ual activity " he said .
J@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ co key points
There are 1@@ 3@@ ,@@ 4@@ 35 c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative cases ( 1@@ 2@@ ,@@ 15@@ 8 AIDS and 1,3@@ 17 HI@@ V ) .
The state is 4@@ th in the nation in new and c@@ um@@ ul@@ ative cases of AIDS and 13@@ th in HI@@ V .
92 % of new in@@ f@@ ections are through se@@ x , 6 % vi@@ a the b@@ loo@@ d@@ stream and 2 % per@@ in@@ at@@ al .
An estimated 5@@ 0,000 people may be living with HI@@ V , as for each registered case there are around 4@@ -@@ 5 people who do not know they are po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e .
R@@ at@@ i@@ fied by a United States court of a@@ p@@ pe@@ al , a judgement which ig@@ n@@ o@@ res the re@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tur@@ ing of the V@@ it@@ r@@ o Group 's debt achieved vi@@ a a bank@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy in Mexico , the sc@@ en@@ ar@@ io is an o@@ m@@ in@@ ou@@ s pre@@ ce@@ dent for any national company with offices in the n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ ing country that has sol@@ ven@@ cy problems .
It seems , then , that the p@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ ings in support of s@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of firms permit M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an law are not v@@ al@@ id in the land of stars and stri@@ p@@ es , con@@ tr@@ ar@@ y to international con@@ ven@@ tions .
In p@@ r@@ ac@@ tic@@ al terms , the en@@ d@@ or@@ se@@ ment of the judgement delivered on 15 June by Judge Har@@ lin H@@ al@@ e of the Ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy Court of the Nor@@ th@@ er@@ n D@@ i@@ st@@ ri@@ c@@ t of Texas , leaves M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an firms def@@ en@@ c@@ el@@ ess against possible s@@ e@@ i@@ z@@ ure of their property outside of Mexico .
However , the decision opens the do@@ or for the leading gl@@ ass man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er in Mexico to a@@ p@@ pe@@ al to the Supreme Court of the United States , c@@ la@@ im@@ ing three in@@ con@@ si@@ st@@ en@@ c@@ i@@ es .
From the start , while the trial judge notes that c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ ors should be go@@ v@@ er@@ n@@ ed by the United States Ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy C@@ o@@ de , the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al for the F@@ i@@ f@@ th C@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ it , based in New Orleans , states that the main action is the in@@ sol@@ ven@@ cy action h@@ an@@ d@@ led in Mexico .
The first point would involve ig@@ n@@ or@@ ing international p@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ dur@@ al cooperation in cases of in@@ sol@@ ven@@ cy of companies with trans@@ national p@@ ro@@ f@@ iles .
In@@ de@@ ed , the U@@ N Mo@@ de@@ l Law for International T@@ r@@ a@@ de Law Un@@ i@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ity was created for this pur@@ po@@ se , with the American Law Institute po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ed as ar@@ bit@@ r@@ at@@ or .
S@@ e@@ con@@ d@@ ly , the judgement e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ ishes that without the inter@@ company vote , with the de@@ b@@ ts the V@@ it@@ r@@ o subsidiaries had with their par@@ ent company re@@ co@@ gn@@ ised in the c@@ r@@ it@@ ical m@@ ass of the in@@ sol@@ ven@@ cy , the majority needed to appro@@ v@@ e the re@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tur@@ ing might not be achieved .
However , M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an law re@@ co@@ gn@@ i@@ s@@ es the po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ility .
In fact , the V@@ it@@ r@@ o case was not the first one in which the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e was accepted .
There are half a dozen e@@ x@@ am@@ pl@@ es , including A@@ g@@ re@@ m@@ e@@ x and Com@@ mer@@ c@@ i@@ al M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ ana , whose inter@@ company de@@ b@@ ts were en@@ d@@ or@@ s@@ ed by the Federal Ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy Institute .
What is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the V@@ it@@ r@@ o c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ ors who fought against it in the US courts , n@@ am@@ ely " v@@ ul@@ t@@ ure " funds such as Au@@ re@@ li@@ os Capital , Au@@ re@@ li@@ os Con@@ v@@ er@@ gen@@ ce , El@@ li@@ o@@ t International and Liverpool L@@ im@@ it@@ ed , did not achieve a majority .
The vote was a@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly 45 percent v@@ er@@ su@@ s 37 .
This data is o@@ m@@ it@@ ted by the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al .
From another perspective , the latter b@@ l@@ am@@ es V@@ it@@ r@@ o for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avo@@ id the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country .
For now , the G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z S@@ ad@@ a family firm has lo@@ d@@ ged a mo@@ ti@@ on for re@@ con@@ si@@ der@@ ation before the Court of A@@ p@@ pe@@ al for the vote to reach the pl@@ en@@ ar@@ y of the court , that is , the five j@@ ud@@ g@@ es , given that only three vo@@ ted previously .
Should this f@@ a@@ il , an a@@ p@@ pe@@ al for re@@ view by a higher court , in this case the US Supreme Court , will be filed .
The real problem is that the court b@@ y@@ p@@ as@@ s@@ ed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of am@@ i@@ c@@ us cur@@ i@@ a@@ e ( " friend of the Court " ) , which details the procedure fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed by V@@ it@@ r@@ o under the f@@ r@@ am@@ e@@ work of the Com@@ mer@@ c@@ i@@ al In@@ sol@@ ven@@ cy Law , n@@ o@@ ting that the latter di@@ s@@ ch@@ ar@@ ged itself with ad@@ her@@ ence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Cha@@ p@@ ter 15 of the Ban@@ k@@ ru@@ p@@ t@@ cy Act of the United States .
Mo@@ re@@ over , it should be noted that the country y@@ i@@ el@@ ded to the p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ es of the United Nations Commission on International T@@ r@@ a@@ de , that is the r@@ ul@@ es set for cross-@@ border in@@ sol@@ ven@@ cy cases , en@@ s@@ ur@@ ing f@@ a@@ ir@@ n@@ ess for de@@ b@@ tors and c@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ ors .

H@@ ec@@ tor " H@@ e@@ t@@ in " Re@@ y@@ es : " Basketball has been my life "
Basketball g@@ lo@@ be@@ tro@@ tter H@@ ec@@ tor " H@@ e@@ t@@ in " Re@@ y@@ es was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , th@@ an@@ ks to it , tra@@ v@@ elled the world .
F@@ e@@ w people in Puerto R@@ i@@ c@@ o have a mental rec@@ olle@@ ction of local basketball history as bro@@ ad as that of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor " H@@ e@@ t@@ in " Re@@ y@@ es .
Re@@ y@@ es was im@@ mer@@ s@@ ed in the sport for over 60 years before being con@@ fined to a whe@@ el@@ chair in 2008 following a stroke ; he was a m@@ in@@ or league player , National Superior Basketball player , B@@ S@@ N re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ ative and manager with the Bay@@ am@@ ó@@ n V@@ a@@ qu@@ er@@ os or President of the Basketball F@@ e@@ der@@ ation .
" I wore lo@@ ts of h@@ at@@ s in basketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the B@@ S@@ N , general manager and fe@@ der@@ ative president of the National Team during the ' 9@@ 0@@ s , " recalled Re@@ y@@ es during Pri@@ mer@@ a H@@ or@@ a 's visit to his home in Bay@@ am@@ ó@@ n , where he li@@ ves with I@@ sa@@ be@@ l , his loyal wife for over 50 years .
" Basketball has been my life . "
Re@@ y@@ es is not e@@ x@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating when he makes that statement .
The walls of his h@@ ou@@ se are almost totally decorated with pictures and m@@ em@@ or@@ ab@@ ili@@ a den@@ o@@ ting his long career , which go@@ es to prove it .
Bay@@ am@@ ó@@ n at h@@ e@@ art
Of them all , the on@@ es he tre@@ as@@ u@@ res with the most emo@@ ti@@ on are the on@@ es that re@@ mind him of his time spent with the V@@ a@@ qu@@ er@@ os , from the mid-@@ 5@@ 0@@ s as a player until 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 , when he completed 15 years serving as co@@ -@@ agent or agent of the franchise .
" Those were my best years , the on@@ es I en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ a@@ qu@@ er@@ os ' eight ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ ships , since 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 7 , either as agent , co@@ -@@ agent or manager .
There were many good years , including the five consecutive ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ ships from 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1 to 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 5 .
And then I said g@@ oo@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e with one in 1981 , J@@ er@@ o@@ m@@ e M@@ inc@@ y 's debut year in the B@@ S@@ N .
Th@@ en " C@@ u@@ co " Or@@ ti@@ z took over - he was a great manager " said Re@@ y@@ es .
I remember that Gen@@ e Bar@@ to@@ w , who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , said to me ' I 've got a very strong player for you , 6 ' 7 " t@@ all .
D@@ o you want him ? '
And that was the beginning of M@@ inc@@ y , one of the best players Puerto R@@ i@@ c@@ o ever had .
Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the sh@@ ar@@ p@@ sh@@ oo@@ ter G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ se R@@ ay@@ mond , who established re@@ si@@ den@@ cy here and was one of our best sh@@ oo@@ ters .
I remember him saying that if M@@ inc@@ y had given Bay@@ am@@ on one championship , G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ se would help get another .
The V@@ a@@ qu@@ er@@ os ' championship with G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ se was en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed , but from a distance , because in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 8 he was already becoming a fe@@ der@@ ative b@@ ig@@ shot .
For that time , he pre@@ fer@@ red to enjoy his own and M@@ inc@@ y 's accomplishments in the national team .
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre@@ -@@ Olympics in Mexico .
Th@@ en came the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been b@@ r@@ on@@ ze , but for the Canadian re@@ fer@@ e@@ e who made us re@@ pe@@ at the final play for the second time , said Re@@ y@@ es .
Is the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0 World National Team the best you 've ever seen ?
It 's one of the best , as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics .
However , my f@@ a@@ vo@@ ur@@ it@@ e was the one in the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 1 P@@ an American Games in C@@ u@@ b@@ a , when we won gold and gave the US team a beating , which was quite similar to the time we won b@@ r@@ on@@ ze at the World Cup .
That team not only again included M@@ inc@@ y , G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ se , R@@ am@@ on Ri@@ v@@ as , F@@ i@@ c@@ o L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z and ' Pic@@ ul@@ í@@ n ' ( Or@@ ti@@ z ) , but also the young ( J@@ a@@ vi@@ er ) ' T@@ o@@ ñ@@ it@@ o ' Col@@ ó@@ n and James Car@@ ter , the Le@@ on brothers ( Franc@@ i@@ s@@ co and Edgar ) and Mar@@ io ' Q@@ u@@ i@@ jo@@ te ' Morales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury .
A team that m@@ ay@@ be was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold m@@ e@@ d@@ al and was a great joy to work with , was the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 Pre@@ -@@ O@@ l@@ y@@ mp@@ ic team in Ne@@ u@@ qu@@ en , Argentina .
With role players such as ' C@@ an@@ it@@ o ' N@@ i@@ e@@ ves , P@@ ab@@ l@@ o A@@ lic@@ e@@ a and the young R@@ ol@@ an@@ d@@ o Ho@@ ur@@ ru@@ it@@ in@@ er re@@ plac@@ ing the players suspended after the sh@@ ambles of the M@@ ar de@@ l Plat@@ a P@@ an@@ -@@ American Games , we won gold against all the odds .
Who was the best Puerto Rican player ?
Without any doubt , Pic@@ ul@@ í@@ n Or@@ ti@@ z .
His numbers at international tournament level are aw@@ es@@ o@@ m@@ e .
Nobody in Puerto R@@ i@@ c@@ o has d@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ated at that level like Pic@@ ul@@ í@@ n did .
Not to men@@ ti@@ on his career in the v@@ ar@@ ious le@@ ag@@ ues he played in .
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager ?
That 's a difficult one .
We had a very good team , including Julio Tor@@ o , Fl@@ or Mel@@ en@@ dez , Car@@ lo@@ s Morales , R@@ ay@@ mond D@@ al@@ m@@ a@@ u , Ar@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ it@@ o Tor@@ res .
Of the yo@@ ung@@ st@@ ers , I really like the work of Le@@ o Ar@@ ill .
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the fe@@ der@@ ation ?
H@@ av@@ ing been part of the National Team 's most gl@@ or@@ ious era between 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 8 and 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 and in the early 9@@ 0@@ s the B@@ S@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season .
What was there left for you to do ?
There were things I 'd have liked to im@@ p@@ le@@ ment , such as re@@ g@@ i@@ on@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ing the m@@ in@@ or le@@ ag@@ ues .
For example , the bo@@ ys of P@@ once only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the i@@ s@@ land in the national playoffs .
R@@ ig@@ h@@ t now the k@@ ids are ri@@ ding and playing too much , un@@ necessarily .
At least I see the f@@ ru@@ it of com@@ p@@ ul@@ s@@ or@@ y c@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ations and a course for leaders , table officials and re@@ fer@@ e@@ es .
That p@@ le@@ as@@ es me .
What are you doing now ?
The most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , enjoy my grandchildren and o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ onally go to basketball games .
And of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .
A@@ c@@ tor Lar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man dies
Lar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man , bor@@ n on 21 September 1@@ 9@@ 31 in Fort Worth ( Texas ) , became world fam@@ ou@@ s for his role as John Ro@@ s@@ s E@@ wing , better known as " J@@ R , " in the television series " Dallas , " in which he played a ru@@ th@@ less , m@@ al@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s and man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ative b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ man .
Lar@@ ry H@@ ag@@ man , whose role as oil ty@@ co@@ on pre@@ d@@ ator J@@ R E@@ wing in the television series " Dallas " became a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of g@@ re@@ ed in the 1980s , has died .
He was 81 .
H@@ ag@@ man , who re@@ turned this year as J@@ R in a new season of " Dallas , " died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications , according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by the Warner B@@ ro@@ s. , producer of " Dallas . "
" Lar@@ ry was back in his b@@ el@@ o@@ v@@ ed h@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ own of Dallas , once again representing the i@@ c@@ on@@ ic role he most liked " the family said .
Lar@@ ry 's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day h@@ o@@ li@@ day .
Lin@@ d@@ a Gra@@ y , who played his wife in the original series and the sequ@@ el , was with H@@ ag@@ man when he died in a hospital in Dallas , said her p@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ist , J@@ eff@@ re@@ y Lan@@ e .
He brought joy to all who knew him .
He was creative , gen@@ er@@ ou@@ s , f@@ un@@ n@@ y , lo@@ ving and talented , and I will mis@@ s him de@@ ar@@ ly .
" He was an original guy and lived life to the full " said Gra@@ y in a statement .
H@@ ag@@ man was di@@ ag@@ n@@ o@@ s@@ ed with c@@ ir@@ r@@ h@@ o@@ sis of the li@@ ver in 1992 and ad@@ mit@@ ted that he had drunk a lot over the years .
In 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 a m@@ al@@ ign@@ ant t@@ um@@ our as found in his li@@ ver and he un@@ der@@ went a tr@@ an@@ sp@@ l@@ ant .
Years before " Dallas , " H@@ ag@@ man became fam@@ ou@@ s on television as a de@@ cent guy in the light com@@ e@@ d@@ y " I Dream of J@@ e@@ ann@@ ie , " ai@@ red on NBC from 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 5 to 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 0 .
He played Captain Tony N@@ el@@ son , an a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ t whose life is changed when he m@@ e@@ ets an attractive gen@@ ie , played by Barbara E@@ d@@ en , and takes her home to live with him .
He also starred in two s@@ it@@ com@@ s that were not ai@@ red for long , " The Good Li@@ f@@ e " ( NBC , 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1-@@ 7@@ 2 ) and " Here We Go A@@ g@@ a@@ in " ( ABC , 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 3 ) .
His film work included roles well received by c@@ r@@ it@@ ics in " The Group , " " Harry and T@@ onto " and " Pri@@ m@@ ar@@ y Col@@ ors . "
But it was his m@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ ful inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation of d@@ el@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ fully de@@ te@@ st@@ able J@@ R that led to H@@ ag@@ man re@@ a@@ ch@@ ing his pe@@ ak of star@@ do@@ m .
The drama series on CBS about the E@@ wing cl@@ an and other characters in their or@@ bit ai@@ red from April 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 8 to May 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 1 .
The t@@ ag@@ line " Who shot J@@ R ? , " designed to gen@@ er@@ ate h@@ y@@ p@@ e around an episode full of emo@@ tions in which H@@ ag@@ man 's char@@ ac@@ ter is nearly killed , gen@@ er@@ ated international speculation and millions of risky dollars w@@ ag@@ ered in g@@ aming e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ments .
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time .
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 0 , an average of 4@@ 1 million viewers tuned in and made " Dallas " the second most w@@ at@@ ched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of " M@@ AS@@ H " in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers .
It was J@@ R 's si@@ st@@ er@@ -@@ in-@@ law K@@ ri@@ st@@ in ( played by Mary Cros@@ by ) who shot him .
J@@ R got her pre@@ gn@@ ant then threatened to say she was a p@@ ro@@ st@@ it@@ ute un@@ less she left town , but there were others who also had re@@ as@@ on@@ s to attack him .
H@@ ag@@ man p@@ or@@ tra@@ y@@ ed E@@ wing as a cor@@ ru@@ p@@ t in@@ s@@ at@@ i@@ able man with a char@@ i@@ s@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c smile : a di@@ sh@@ on@@ est ent@@ re@@ p@@ r@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r and ch@@ e@@ ating husband who tried to have his al@@ co@@ h@@ o@@ li@@ c wife , S@@ ue Ellen ( Lin@@ d@@ a Gra@@ y ) , se@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ed .
" I know what I want on J@@ R 's t@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ st@@ one " H@@ ag@@ man said in 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 8 .
It should read : " Here li@@ es the hon@@ est c@@ it@@ i@@ zen J@@ R E@@ wing . "
This is the only deal he lost .
V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ ia P@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ al , co-star of the original series , recalled H@@ ag@@ man on Friday as someone " huge , on and off screen . "
He is un@@ f@@ or@@ g@@ e@@ tt@@ able and ir@@ re@@ plac@@ e@@ able , for millions of fans around the world , and in the h@@ e@@ ar@@ ts of each one of us who was f@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ ate enough to know and love him .
T@@ en ep@@ iso@@ des of the new e@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on of " Dallas " were bro@@ ad@@ cast a few months ago with great success for TNT .
He had already finished recording five ep@@ iso@@ des for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain reported .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after , there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of H@@ ag@@ man .
H@@ ag@@ man , bor@@ n in Fort Worth , Texas , was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin , who starred in c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ c@@ s such as " South Pac@@ i@@ fi@@ c " and " Peter P@@ an . "
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1@@ 9@@ 31 during her marriage to lawyer Ben H@@ ag@@ man .
He tried his lu@@ ck in the New York the@@ at@@ re scene in the early ' 5@@ 0@@ s , and later served in the A@@ ir For@@ ce from 1952 to 1@@ 9@@ 56 , in England .
While there , he met the young S@@ w@@ e@@ di@@ s@@ h des@@ ig@@ ner Ma@@ j A@@ x@@ el@@ s@@ son and m@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed her .
The couple had two s@@ on@@ s , Pre@@ st@@ on and H@@ e@@ i@@ d@@ i , and lived for a long time in the Californ@@ ian city Malibu , home to many c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ es .
In 2001 , he called his m@@ em@@ o@@ ir@@ s " Hello D@@ ar@@ lin ' : T@@ all ( and Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely True ) T@@ ales About My Li@@ f@@ e . "
" I didn 't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way " he told Associated Press at the time .
After his li@@ ver tr@@ an@@ sp@@ l@@ ant , he became an organ don@@ ation p@@ ro@@ mo@@ ter and worked as a v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er at a hospital , h@@ el@@ p@@ ing fearful patients .
" I advise them , en@@ cour@@ age them , meet with them when they come for their surgery , and af@@ ter@@ war@@ ds " he said in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 .
I try to offer some com@@ f@@ or@@ t , such as " D@@ on 't be af@@ r@@ a@@ id , it will be a little un@@ comfortable for a short time , but then you 'll be fine . "
He was also an anti-@@ smoking ac@@ tiv@@ ist and took part in several camp@@ a@@ ig@@ n@@ s .
Start of a course that explo@@ res the " En@@ d of the World "
Each week , students e@@ x@@ pl@@ or@@ e a@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ tic th@@ em@@ es such as nuclear war , z@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ies , v@@ ir@@ us@@ es and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
This term , when Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of religion , St@@ u@@ art Ch@@ ar@@ m@@ é , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a com@@ p@@ ell@@ ing hook : The end of the " long co@@ un@@ t@@ down " of the M@@ ay@@ an c@@ al@@ en@@ d@@ ar , 21 December , which had con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed many people that the end of the world was coming .
But Ch@@ ar@@ m@@ é had no idea what a@@ wa@@ it@@ ed him over the next couple of months : The cat@@ ac@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ m@@ ic h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e S@@ an@@ d@@ y , a fiscal pre@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ c@@ e some called " debt Ar@@ m@@ a@@ g@@ e@@ d@@ don " and a growing con@@ fli@@ c@@ t involving Israel , where en@@ d@@ -@@ o@@ f@@ -@@ th@@ e-@@ world Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ i@@ ans the@@ or@@ ists think the A@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ se will begin .
" I didn 't real@@ ise this was going to be the most a@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ tic term ever " said Ch@@ ar@@ m@@ é this week to students at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s-@@ C@@ am@@ d@@ en University ( New Jersey ) .
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and co@@ un@@ ting , this has been a really good period .
And remember that bad is good for those with an a@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ tic m@@ ent@@ ality .
And he is not the only p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or who offers co@@ ur@@ s@@ es on the " end of the world " this term , the@@ o@@ re@@ tic@@ ally the last in history .
At T@@ em@@ p@@ le , A@@ s@@ so@@ c@@ i@@ ate Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or Barry V@@ acker is giving the course " Media , Cul@@ t@@ ure and the end of the world . "
Each week , students e@@ x@@ pl@@ or@@ e a@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ tic th@@ em@@ es such as nuclear war , z@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ies , v@@ ir@@ us@@ es and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
" We looked at why these i@@ de@@ as p@@ ro@@ li@@ fer@@ ate over time " he said , and how they offer h@@ y@@ po@@ the@@ tic@@ al sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os that g@@ u@@ i@@ de human be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our .
If nuclear material falls into the hands of ter@@ r@@ or@@ ists , for example , a war could break out .
This month students an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ ed mo@@ vi@@ es with an a@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ tic th@@ em@@ e and explo@@ red how they com@@ p@@ are with re@@ al-@@ life e@@ x@@ am@@ pl@@ es .
" I 've tried to in@@ form students about what is possible , p@@ ro@@ b@@ able , c@@ re@@ di@@ ble and im@@ possible " said V@@ acker .
At the main Pennsylvania State University campus , Latin American History Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or M@@ at@@ the@@ w R@@ e@@ st@@ all , and his c@@ olle@@ ag@@ ue A@@ m@@ ar@@ a Sol@@ ari , an A@@ s@@ so@@ c@@ i@@ ate Art History and An@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or , have te@@ amed up to give a course , called simply " The end of the world . "
" We don 't add ' 2012 ' so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world doesn 't come to an end " said R@@ e@@ st@@ all .
Despite the " im@@ p@@ en@@ ding d@@ oo@@ m , " students have to study , un@@ der@@ take projects and take final e@@ x@@ am@@ s .
At P@@ en@@ n State , the final e@@ x@@ am will be taken on the e@@ v@@ e of the A@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ se , which leaves students no choice but to work " until the very night the world is su@@ p@@ posed to end " said R@@ e@@ st@@ all .
The co@@ ur@@ s@@ es proved quite popular .
" It was fully b@@ oo@@ ked within two hours " said R@@ e@@ st@@ all , on his course for students with high aver@@ ag@@ es , which was filled with 35 students .
We received em@@ a@@ il@@ s for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any plac@@ es .
St@@ ud@@ ent@@ s , m@@ e@@ an@@ while , say the course is one of the most inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing around .
" I find it f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ ating to see what people do to con@@ sol@@ e themselves " said Bri@@ dg@@ id Robinson , a 2@@ 3@@ -year-old po@@ st@@ -@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ ate Rel@@ ig@@ ion and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ology student from H@@ ad@@ d@@ on@@ field , New Jersey , at R@@ ut@@ ger@@ s-@@ C@@ am@@ d@@ en .
And the a@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ tic , se@@ c@@ ul@@ ar or religious m@@ ent@@ ality is just a matter consolation or a lack of it .
Will We@@ k@@ es@@ a , a 25@@ -year-old po@@ st@@ -@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ ate P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ology and N@@ ur@@ s@@ ing student , said he had seen all the a@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ tic mo@@ vi@@ es .
" I 'd never heard of a class that could te@@ a@@ ch it " he said .
I enjoy it .
But n@@ one of the students inter@@ vie@@ wed - much less any p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or - said they believed in the end date of December 2@@ 1@@ s@@ t .
" Our first project was about the M@@ ay@@ an p@@ ro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y and to a certain extent we di@@ sc@@ re@@ d@@ it@@ ed it " said Julie Z@@ eg@@ l@@ en , a 2@@ 1@@ -year-old final year student at T@@ em@@ p@@ le , from West Chester .
The M@@ ay@@ ans never predicted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the c@@ al@@ en@@ d@@ ar , said R@@ e@@ st@@ all .
But he said that Western culture su@@ f@@ f@@ ers from a@@ po@@ c@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ tic anxiety , which go@@ es back several c@@ ent@@ ur@@ ies , in which people re@@ act to changes around them by pre@@ di@@ c@@ ting the end of the world .
The Internet has caused a b@@ oo@@ m in these spec@@ ulations .
" In other plac@@ es , people don 't think about it " he said .
It 's mostly in the En@@ gl@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ -@@ speaking world .
Joseph D@@ ou@@ gh@@ er@@ ty , a Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of religion at L@@ a S@@ alle University , who is giving co@@ ur@@ s@@ es in the Philippines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any co@@ ur@@ s@@ es on the " end of the world " there .
" The Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world " he wrote , suggesting an e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ on of a higher authority .
We have an in@@ d@@ ul@@ gen@@ ce from the Pop@@ e .
R@@ e@@ st@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement , and said that if nothing happens on December 2@@ 1@@ s@@ t , " people will immediately start thinking of the next date " or ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ i@@ s@@ ing that December 2@@ 1@@ s@@ t is the beginning of a seven-@@ year period after which the world will end .
St@@ ud@@ ent@@ s and teachers are taking the date li@@ gh@@ t@@ ly .
Some said they plan to go to " end of the world " parties .
" M@@ ay@@ be I 'll call some friends so we can have a l@@ a@@ u@@ gh together " said S@@ am@@ ir@@ a Ford , 20@@ -year-old com@@ m@@ un@@ i@@ c@@ ations student .
