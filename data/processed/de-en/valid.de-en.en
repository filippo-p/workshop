A Republican strategy to counter the re-@@ election of Obama
Republican leaders j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied their policy by the need to com@@ b@@ at el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al fraud .
However , the B@@ r@@ en@@ n@@ an C@@ ent@@ re con@@ si@@ der@@ s this a m@@ y@@ th , stating that el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al fraud is r@@ ar@@ er in the United States than the number of people killed by li@@ gh@@ t@@ n@@ ing .
In@@ de@@ ed , Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al fraud in the United States in a de@@ c@@ a@@ de .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on vo@@ ter tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c system .
Un@@ like in Canada , the American States are responsible for the or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new la@@ ws since 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 making the re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation or voting process more difficult .
This ph@@ en@@ o@@ m@@ en@@ on gained m@@ o@@ m@@ ent@@ um following the November 20@@ 10 elections , which saw 6@@ 75 new Republican re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ at@@ i@@ ves added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 b@@ ill@@ s re@@ stri@@ c@@ ting the exercise of the right to vote in 4@@ 1 States were introduced in 20@@ 11 alone .
The new election la@@ ws re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e voters to show a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card and p@@ ro@@ of of US c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ ship .
Furthermore , these la@@ ws also reduce early voting periods , in@@ v@@ al@@ i@@ date the right to re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er as a vo@@ ter on election day and wi@@ th@@ draw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
Be@@ f@@ or@@ e the 2006 elections , no US State re@@ qu@@ i@@ red voters to show a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card .
In@@ di@@ ana was the first State to im@@ po@@ se such a re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment .
In 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ality of the In@@ di@@ ana law .
The Republican authorities were quick to e@@ x@@ tend this practice to other States .
Over the past two years , they sp@@ on@@ so@@ red b@@ ill@@ s in 3@@ 4 States to force voters to show a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card .
It is important to note that , un@@ like Q@@ u@@ e@@ be@@ c , American citizens do not have a universal I@@ D card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i@@ .@@ e@@ . 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card issued by a government agency of their State .
In addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such i@@ den@@ ti@@ fication .
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to ob@@ ta@@ in the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red id@@ ent@@ ity card .
The new restrictions disp@@ ro@@ p@@ or@@ ti@@ on@@ ately affect young people , m@@ in@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ es and people with low in@@ comes .
In fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those e@@ ar@@ n@@ ing less than $ 3@@ 5,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 2@@ 9 years old do not have the re@@ qu@@ i@@ red p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card .
And that 's not all .
St@@ ud@@ ent@@ s , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card issued by their in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on .
On the other hand , these same States al@@ low fishing or hun@@ ting club members , who vote more Republican , to use the cards issued by these c@@ lu@@ bs when they vote .
Prior to 2004 , no State re@@ qu@@ i@@ red p@@ ro@@ of of c@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ en@@ ship to vote .
Arizona was the first to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce such a re@@ qu@@ i@@ re@@ ment .
Since 20@@ 11 , a dozen States have adopted la@@ ws re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing voters to prove they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the H@@ i@@ s@@ p@@ an@@ ic vote .
However , it appears that two out of three H@@ i@@ s@@ p@@ an@@ ic voters favour the Democratic party .
What is more , in 20@@ 11 Republican le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ lat@@ ors sp@@ on@@ so@@ red la@@ ws ab@@ ol@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing the re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation of voters on election day in eight States .
In addition , they limited the right of in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als and groups to provide assistance to voters w@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing to re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er .
These restrictions are not without con@@ sequ@@ ence .
For example , during the 2004 general election , vo@@ ter re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation camp@@ a@@ ig@@ n@@ s contributed to re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er@@ ing around 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 have led to a 17 % drop in the re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation rate of new voters in 20@@ 10 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Republican le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ lat@@ ors have en@@ acted la@@ ws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
For example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were A@@ f@@ ri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans , who ac@@ co@@ un@@ ted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
The same app@@ li@@ ed to Hispanics .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who vo@@ ted early .
On the other hand , 7@@ 6 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
Of course , Democratic le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ lat@@ ors and their supporters v@@ ig@@ or@@ ously opposed the ad@@ option of la@@ ws re@@ stri@@ c@@ ting vo@@ ter re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation .
Several b@@ ill@@ s were blocked by v@@ e@@ t@@ o@@ es of Democratic governors .
The United States A@@ tt@@ or@@ ne@@ y General inter@@ ven@@ ed to s@@ us@@ p@@ end the most controversial la@@ ws .
They were able to parti@@ ally limit the damage .
For example , only 16 out of 3@@ 4 States have adopted la@@ ws re@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing the presentation of a p@@ h@@ o@@ to I@@ D card .
However , the new r@@ ul@@ es put in place will undoub@@ te@@ d@@ ly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
Democratic c@@ r@@ it@@ ics den@@ oun@@ ce the par@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ an char@@ ac@@ ter of the la@@ ws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of in@@ f@@ lu@@ en@@ c@@ ing the 2012 results in key States .
A 20@@ 11 B@@ r@@ en@@ n@@ an C@@ ent@@ re report shows that the States that have adopted these la@@ ws re@@ present 17@@ 1 of the 270 votes needed in the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al college to win the Pre@@ si@@ den@@ cy .
It is too early to say with c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty that these le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ l@@ ative changes in the el@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ al system will have significant im@@ p@@ acts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the tur@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c system .
