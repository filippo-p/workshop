A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Bren@@ nan Centre considers this a my@@ th , stating that electoral fraud is r@@ arer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning .
Indeed , Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter t@@ u@@ r@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American democratic system .
Unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the regist@@ ration or voting process more difficult .
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 bills restri@@ cting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship .
Fur@@ ther@@ more , these laws also reduce early voting periods , i@@ n@@ v@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ date the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
Before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card .
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement .
In 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitu@@ tion@@ ality of the Indiana law .
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States .
Over the past two years , they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
It is important to note that , unlike Quebec , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i@@ .@@ e@@ . 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State .
In addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
The new restrictions disp@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ tion@@ ately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
In fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card .
And that 's not all .
Students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution .
On the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republican , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
Prior to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Arizona was the first to intro@@ duce such a requirement .
Since 2011 , a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote .
However , it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic party .
What is more , in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws a@@ b@@ o@@ l@@ ishing the regist@@ ration of voters on election day in eight States .
In addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
These restrictions are not without c@@ o@@ n@@ sequ@@ ence .
For example , during the 2004 general election , voter regist@@ ration campaigns contributed to regist@@ ering around 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the regist@@ ration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Republican legislators have e@@ n@@ acted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
For example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were A@@ f@@ r@@ i@@ can-@@ Americans , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
The same applied to Hispanics .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
On the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
Of course , Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restri@@ cting voter regist@@ ration .
Several bills were blocked by vet@@ oes of Democratic governors .
The United States Attorney General interven@@ ed to suspend the most controversial laws .
They were able to parti@@ ally limit the damage .
For example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
However , the new rules put in place will u@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ u@@ b@@ tedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
Democratic critics d@@ e@@ n@@ ounce the partis@@ an character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influ@@ encing the 2012 results in key States .
A 2011 Bren@@ nan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency .
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant imp@@ acts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the t@@ u@@ r@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will parti@@ ally undermine the American democratic system .
P@@ r@@ o@@ state cancer screening : take the test or not ?
Indeed , the P@@ SA test sometimes shows erron@@ eous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve u@@ n@@ necessary medical interventions .
E@@ n@@ ough to make already reluctant men hes@@ itate to take screening tests .
Take the test or not ?
We asked two specialists for their opinion .
In studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of cont@@ a@@ m@@ ination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpre@@ t the data and make firm recommendations .
Another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in mor@@ tal@@ ity between patients who were screened and those who were not .
This study also showed , with a follow-up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for met@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ ases to occur in the absence of screening .
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct rel@@ ative who previously had prostate cancer .
African-American men are also more at risk .
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
There are aggressive cancers and others that are ind@@ olent .
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long-term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
Today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
Ac@@ tive monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progres@@ ses , they will be offered treatment .
More and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
Ther@@ e@@ fore I recommend taking the test .
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
In collaboration with the So@@ c@@ i@@ é@@ t@@ é i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ nation@@ ale d '@@ u@@ rolog@@ ie [ S@@ I@@ U ] , M@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ m@@ ber has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and c@@ o@@ n@@ s of the P@@ SA test .

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer .
Despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exerc@@ ised enough , 30 % of cancers could be prevented .
" If no more people smo@@ ked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , " says André Beau@@ lieu , spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society .
On the other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of cancers are h@@ e@@ r@@ e@@ d@@ itary .
Some are also completely u@@ n@@ explained .
For the Canadian Cancer Society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smo@@ kers .
C@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ es are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
It is also a risk factor for a number of others .
This massi@@ vely damages people 's health .
" Even today , there are 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Quebec " deplo@@ res spokesperson André Beau@@ lieu .
E@@ n@@ cour@@ aging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drops by half .
W@@ e@@ i@@ ght
Over@@ weight and obesity are also condu@@ cive to the o@@ n@@ set of the disease , according to the SC@@ C .
They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , col@@ on and r@@ e@@ c@@ tum , o@@ e@@ s@@ o@@ p@@ h@@ a@@ g@@ us , pan@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ as and u@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ us .
" Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against col@@ on cancer " it is also said .
Diet
The organisation also recommen@@ ds limit@@ ing your consumption of red meat .
In large amounts , it increases the risks of developing colo@@ -@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ tal cancer .
Lik@@ e@@ wise , so do c@@ ured meat products , and these should be avo@@ ided .
The conservation of meat by smoking , d@@ r@@ ying or c@@ u@@ r@@ ing can cause the formation of car@@ cin@@ o@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ s .
" They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer " it is explained .
V@@ i@@ t@@ amins
In recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vit@@ amin supplements and cancer .
For the time being however their research is inconclusive .
Stu@@ dies on vit@@ amin E are contra@@ dic@@ tory , according to the SC@@ C .
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer , another noted an increase .
Also the effect of vit@@ amin D on cancer is not clear .
In addition , Mr Beau@@ lieu emph@@ a@@ s@@ ises the importance of discuss@@ ing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
" Taking a screening test doesn 't give you cancer . "
The Hig@@ gs b@@ o@@ son revealed
The announcement of the prob@@ able discovery of the Hig@@ gs b@@ o@@ son created quite a stir last summer , and with good reason .
Indeed , it is believed that this b@@ o@@ son is part of the mechan@@ ism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe , no less .
Also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard M@@ o@@ del - our best or " less worse " explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed emp@@ i@@ r@@ i@@ cally .
But for physi@@ c@@ ists , it is still not completely sure that it really is the Hig@@ gs .
We know without a sha@@ dow of a doubt that it is a new auth@@ enti@@ c particle , and greatly r@@ e@@ sem@@ bles the Hig@@ gs b@@ o@@ son predicted by the Standard M@@ o@@ del .
In addition , new data unveiled this week at a large physi@@ cs Congress in K@@ y@@ o@@ to seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
But let 's sup@@ pose that it really is the Hig@@ gs , since the chances of being mist@@ aken seem sli@@ m , and see what it is .
In our world , there is a fatally u@@ n@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time .
There 's no way to break this rule - and don 't try too hard , you 'll go mad .
However , even though particle physi@@ cs is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the Paul@@ i exclu@@ sion principle , which states that two parti@@ cles cannot occup@@ y the same space at the same time if they are in the same " quant@@ um state " - this " state " consi@@ sting roughly of certain of their character@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ics .
Based on this , physi@@ c@@ ists classi@@ fy parti@@ cles into two categories .
In one corner we have good citizens called f@@ e@@ r@@ mi@@ ons , who w@@ i@@ s@@ ely o@@ b@@ e@@ y the Paul@@ i principle .
While lur@@ king in the other are the b@@ o@@ sons , a nasty band of a@@ n@@ arch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
These b@@ o@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Berkeley Lab@@ s P@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ cle Ad@@ venture site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : mes@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and " force parti@@ cles " by which the great forces of nature are prop@@ a@@ g@@ ated and to which the Hig@@ gs b@@ o@@ son may be somehow related .
These b@@ o@@ sons , it must be stressed here , are not all such exo@@ tic bugs as you might think .
In fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordinarily ban@@ al b@@ o@@ son : the p@@ h@@ o@@ ton , or the " light particle " which is the " mes@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ ger " of the electro@@ magnetic force .
When , in fact , a particle having an electric charge a@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ r@@ ates or changes direction , this " distur@@ bs " the electro@@ magnetic field in this specific place , rather like a peb@@ ble thrown in a pond .
This " dist@@ urb@@ ance " produces an electro@@ magnetic wave ( of light , i@@ n@@ fra@@ red , ultra@@ violet e@@ t@@ c . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a p@@ h@@ o@@ ton - and thus one of the " force carrier " b@@ o@@ sons .
More stable field
The same applies to the Hig@@ gs b@@ o@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the Hig@@ gs field , which must be " distur@@ bed " for the b@@ o@@ son to appear .
Now , this Hig@@ gs field is much , much more stable than the electro@@ magnetic field ; to exc@@ ite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a fro@@ zen pond which would need a very large rock to wrinkle the surface .
Which is why a huge particle a@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ r@@ ator like the one at C@@ ER@@ N - the Large H@@ a@@ d@@ ron Col@@ l@@ i@@ der is a ring with a 27@@ km circum@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ence ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
The analo@@ gy with the electro@@ magnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Hig@@ gs and mass .
In fact not all parti@@ cles , or all materials , i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ act with the electro@@ magnetic field .
Some , such as mag@@ nets , do so , but others don 't - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a f@@ r@@ i@@ dge .
And l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ wise , not all parti@@ cles i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ act with the Hig@@ gs field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the p@@ h@@ o@@ ton ) do not .
Now , what is it that all this research " can bring " ? asks Ms P@@ lam@@ o@@ n@@ don .
For science , it serves to check the vali@@ dity of the Standard M@@ o@@ del ( SM ) , and also allows physi@@ cians to examine any disc@@ r@@ e@@ pan@@ cies between the observ@@ ations and predic@@ tions of the SM .
A number of people , m@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , f@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ ently hope that some will be found , because the sli@@ g@@ h@@ test difference could open a door to a " new physi@@ cs " and plug certain holes in the M@@ o@@ del .
This , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation for gravity ( o@@ ops ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Universe ( re-@@ o@@ ops ! ) .
But to date no such disc@@ r@@ e@@ pan@@ cies have been found at C@@ ER@@ N .
R@@ e@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ ussions
The r@@ e@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ ussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there won 't be any .
Remember : in the very early 60s , the pion@@ eers of the l@@ a@@ s@@ er at Bell Labor@@ atories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work .
They had an i@@ n@@ k@@ l@@ ing of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest .
In fact , the late Will@@ ard B@@ o@@ yle - a physi@@ c@@ ist who worked at Bell Lab@@ s , where the l@@ a@@ s@@ er was invented in 1@@ 9@@ 60 , and who himself developed the first continuous l@@ a@@ s@@ er ( the first were pul@@ sed ) in 1962 - told us that initially the l@@ a@@ s@@ er was rather seen as a " lab gad@@ get . "
Just imagine ...
And then , applications can also come from all the instrum@@ entation that s@@ u@@ r@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ ds research .
For example , the same Will@@ ard B@@ o@@ yle developed a small light sens@@ or in 1969 , during his work in optics .
This sens@@ or , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an " eye " to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel physi@@ cs prize in 2009 .
This does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ H@@ C will necessarily trans@@ form our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
Pal@@ l@@ i@@ ative care - The best way to die ... | Le D@@ e@@ v@@ o@@ ir
With its D@@ ying with Dign@@ ity Commission , Quebec recently discussed the del@@ icate issue of the end of life .
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared .
However , in this vital area , much remains to be done .
Le D@@ e@@ v@@ o@@ ir attempted to look more closely .
Just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Mont@@ é@@ r@@ é@@ gie apartment .
The f@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ering prostate cancer had allowed him a two-year resp@@ ite .
" They gave me five years to live , I 've made it to seven , " he says , with mixed emo@@ tions , lying in his bed at the Victor@@ -G@@ a@@ d@@ b@@ o@@ is p@@ alli@@ ative care home in Bel@@ o@@ eil , where he arrived the previous day .
" But it 's still a shock , you can never be prepared for it " he adds .
The disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone , and even eating alone .
Sitting in front of an app@@ e@@ t@@ ising lunch , he consents to being helped to eat , resigned .
Cour@@ age@@ ous , he even m@@ a@@ n@@ ages to smile , talks to the stran@@ gers b@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ ling around him , bringing him his medic@@ ation , offering him a b@@ ath .
The courage of ordinary death .
" What I want most is to be c@@ ured of my diarr@@ hoea , it 's hum@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ating " he confi@@ ded .
A few hours later , the team found a cure for this illness .
" During our lives , we learn that a man p@@ i@@ s@@ ses standing up , " says Pierre Bro@@ d@@ e@@ ur , psych@@ ologist at the Victor@@ -G@@ a@@ d@@ b@@ o@@ is home .
R@@ e@@ gres@@ sing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
" It depends on the person 's ability " to accept the reg@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ sion , he says .
Because , in the opinion of a number of people working in p@@ alli@@ ative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such reg@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ sion .
Patients at the Victor@@ -G@@ a@@ d@@ b@@ o@@ is p@@ alli@@ ative care home all suffer from cancer .
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months .
At this stage , the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called " c@@ u@@ r@@ ative " care .
For Mrs A. , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die " conscious and suff@@ oc@@ ating . "
But the disease has made me discover my children .
" I have fine children " she adds .
" I don 't wish for anything more in life " she says , before accepting having a mas@@ k put on to help her breathe .
She looks forward n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy .
At Victor@@ -G@@ a@@ d@@ b@@ o@@ is , a group of volunteers provides bodily care and help with feeding .
This is p@@ alli@@ ative care , given when there is nothing else that can be done .
To make death more comfortable .
In Quebec , there are p@@ alli@@ ative care beds for 11,@@ 700 i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants .
This is very few when we know that we will all die one day .
Here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains Dr C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ian@@ e M@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ l , one of the doctors at the home .
Whether at a physical comfort , emotional or spiritu@@ al level .
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink b@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ y or Pepsi , whatever is their t@@ i@@ pple .
D@@ i@@ a@@ b@@ e@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar .
And death is part of everyday life .
Yesterday evening , a beer was served to Mr X , who died during the night .
This morning , it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the dec@@ eased .
" We help relatives as much as patients " says N@@ ath@@ a@@ l@@ ie Sav@@ ard , Director of Care .
At the Victor@@ -G@@ a@@ d@@ b@@ o@@ is home , one day follows another but no two are alike .
Along with a 9@@ 3-@@ year-old man who is s@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ uring his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly w@@ e@@ dged in his pil@@ lows while t@@ o@@ asts are drunk in his honour , a 36-@@ year-@@ young man is dying t@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ ically , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
" For six months , there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old " says a concerned Dr C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ian@@ e M@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ l .
53 % of patients admitted to the Victor@@ -G@@ a@@ d@@ b@@ o@@ is home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital .
L@@ ack of access to p@@ alli@@ ative care
It is said that 77 % of Can@@ a@@ d@@ i@@ ans simply have no access to p@@ alli@@ ative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home .
And a number of organis@@ ations , such as the Victor@@ -G@@ a@@ d@@ b@@ o@@ is home and the Pal@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Society in Greater Montreal , speci@@ alise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
It is prec@@ isely this large gap in Quebec health care which has made a number of p@@ alli@@ ative care physi@@ cians fear the adoption of a law on euthan@@ asi@@ a and assi@@ sted suicide .
Since October , a manifesto , signed by p@@ alli@@ ative care lumin@@ aries including Dr Bal@@ four Mount and Dr Bern@@ ard La@@ poin@@ te , has been cir@@ cul@@ ating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
According to Dr C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ian@@ e M@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ l , the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality p@@ alli@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthan@@ asi@@ a .
Rec@@ ently , she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
I 'm afraid that patients ask to die because they don 't receive adequate care .
And at the same time , some o@@ n@@ c@@ ologists work rel@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ lessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst progno@@ ses .
H@@ é@@ l@@ è@@ ne Richard 's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gru@@ elling c@@ h@@ emo@@ therapy .
When I announced to my o@@ n@@ c@@ ologist that I was stopping the treatment , she told me she regre@@ tted that I had given up fighting , she said .
However , she had told me I was finished !
No all-@@ powerful care
Dr M@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ l believes that 90 % of patients asking to die thank care@@ -@@ g@@ i@@ vers for not having a@@ c@@ c@@ eded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a p@@ alli@@ ative care team .
But it must be said that p@@ alli@@ ative care is not absolutely all-@@ powerful in the treatment of pain .
According to El@@ sie M@@ o@@ n@@ e@@ r@@ eau , Pal@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Director with the Pal@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Society in Greater Montreal , patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
At the very end of life , physi@@ cians then often resort to p@@ alli@@ ative sed@@ ation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either spor@@ adic@@ ally or perman@@ ently .
We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering .
Incre@@ a@@ s@@ ingly , an u@@ n@@ relieved patient will have the option of having such p@@ alli@@ ative sed@@ ation .
Patients who are not relieved always say the same thing : " I want to die . "
But this does not necessarily mean " I want you to euthan@@ ise me , " it means " I want to be relieved . "

W@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ ad real estate s@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ als in Quebec
Day after day highway officials , building contractors , political party fund@@ -ra@@ isers and Italian m@@ afia specialists tell what they know of a f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ i@@ d@@ able " system , " combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade u@@ n@@ ion@@ ists and organ@@ ised crime .
An " industry " which has cost Quebec taxpayers d@@ e@@ arly , especially in the 1990s and 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ s .
" It is c@@ u@@ r@@ ious how the system is crum@@ bling since we took drastic measures " says Jacques Du@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ n@@ e@@ au i@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ically , a Quebec politician and former Montreal Chief of Police .
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in-@@ depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Quebec , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean Cha@@ rest , had cons@@ ented only reluc@@ t@@ antly .
The " Du@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ n@@ e@@ au report " established a direct link between industry , under@@ -the-@@ table financing of parties and bri@@ bery of officials .
" Since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts , " with certain people curbing their inst@@ incts to get a share !
The Char@@ bon@@ n@@ e@@ au Commission " has already brought down two may@@ ors " he adds , hoping that it will succeed in " revealing the schemes behind the individuals . "
A permanent anti-@@ corruption unit , created in 2011
The Per@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ent Anti-@@ Cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion Unit , created in 2011 , is also cou@@ pled with its army of government analysts , investigators , and auditors .
P@@ lus the " M@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ au squad " policemen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Montreal " s@@ e@@ wer car@@ t@@ e@@ l " to soft ped@@ al on the inflation of contracts ...
In recent weeks , it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as Frank Z@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ ino and Richard M@@ a@@ r@@ c@@ o@@ tte , Mayor of a suburban town .
Next on the list is apparently Gill@@ es Va@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ court , who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Lav@@ al , third largest city in Quebec .
He is suspected of p@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ eting repeated bri@@ bes in exchange for public contracts .
Others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrep@@ reneurs , including Tony Ac@@ c@@ u@@ r@@ so and Lin@@ o Z@@ a@@ m@@ bit@@ o .
The latter caused a sens@@ ation by explaining the mechan@@ ics of the public contracts " system " to the commission .
He himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ medi@@ ary linked to the m@@ afia who in turn paid the money to Union M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ é@@ al , Mayor G@@ é@@ r@@ a@@ l@@ d Tre@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ay 's party .
Mr Z@@ a@@ m@@ bit@@ o has handed money out fre@@ ely in the 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ s , giving over 88@@ ,000 Canadian dollars ( roughly 68@@ ,000 euros ) to provincial parties , especially the Liber@@ als then in power .
He also admitted having organ@@ ised an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal D@@ e@@ put@@ y-@@ Prime Minister , N@@ ath@@ a@@ l@@ ie Nor@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ au .
Se@@ wer contracts with inf@@ l@@ ated costs
In Montreal , the corruption " system " ran sm@@ o@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ ly .
Gill@@ es Sur@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ ant , former public works engineer , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gifts , invitations to trips , golf tournaments , restaurants , hockey matches and bri@@ bes tot@@ alling 7@@ 36@@ ,000 dollars , in exchange for s@@ e@@ wer contracts of which he inf@@ l@@ ated the costs .
Other highway officials admitted having their pal@@ ms gre@@ ased by inf@@ l@@ ating invoices by 30 to 40 % , and by false add-@@ ons .
Then an organis@@ er of the Mayor 's party , Martin Dum@@ ont , accused Mr Tre@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coff@@ ers with dirty money .
Following these revelations , Mr Tre@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ay resigned in early November , plung@@ ing Montreal into a major crisis .
C@@ h@@ ant@@ al Rou@@ l@@ e@@ a@@ u was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the a@@ l@@ arm .
Mayor of the borough of Ri@@ v@@ i@@ è@@ re-@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ -@@ Pra@@ iries , to the East of the island , she prote@@ sted in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and r@@ e@@ s@@ old for ... 1.6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
70 % dirty money in election campaigns
On the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she " is following a thre@@ ad in order to find out how the system - infil@@ t@@ r@@ ated by ants - works , to put a stop to the g@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ r@@ ene and catch the cul@@ pr@@ its . "
The process , she says , is " painful but positive . "
The wound is being clean@@ ed , but Montreal would need its own investig@@ ative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these questionable practices .
How to clean house .
P@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ ly .
Jacques Du@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ n@@ e@@ au notes for his part that " officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars , " but he is especially concerned about the role of " elected people aware of the scheme , " when they were not up to their n@@ e@@ cks in the scam !
Est@@ i@@ m@@ ating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec at 70 % , he says d@@ r@@ y@@ ly : " I was told that it was only a pale ref@@ l@@ e@@ ction of reality . "
The Quebec government p@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ es to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : " Until election expenses are strictly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . "
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for gran@@ ting public contracts and party funding : " We can 't go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to rebuild the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . "
Although this story tar@@ n@@ ishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal , Mr Du@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ n@@ e@@ au i@@ n@@ v@@ ites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard ...
" P@@ S@@ G is not FC Barcelona ! "
This season , you have taken on a new stat@@ ure with P@@ S@@ G .
How do you explain this progres@@ sion ?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimen@@ sion of P@@ S@@ G .
Some great players have arrived .
Every day I 'm making progress alongside them .
The technical staff has also brought me a lot .
Day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .
And , in a match , it 's easier .
Everything moves very fast in football .
But I don 't get worked up .
From my debut at the Cla@@ i@@ ref@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ ine IN@@ F pre-@@ training centre to my transfer to S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t-@@ E@@ t@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ ne , I 've always moved step by step .
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo Ancel@@ otti ...
This summer 's recruits are used to playing matches at a high level .
They also know that every training session is crucial .
Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best .
On the other hand , Carlo Ancel@@ otti gives me a lot as reg@@ ards my position .
He 's supported by deputies like C@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ de Mak@@ e@@ l@@ ele , who played in the same position as me .
Is Ancel@@ otti the man for the job ?
D@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ n@@ itely .
Ancel@@ otti insp@@ ires respect among all the experts .
Today he has no equ@@ al in Lig@@ ue 1 , and he 's one of the best coaches in Europe .
He has m@@ asses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs .
He 's worked with great players .
I think he will bring more titles to Paris .
In January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I was just coming back from a series of injuries .
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance .
What importance do you attach to the first part of the season for P@@ S@@ G ?
In Lig@@ ue 1 , Lyon overtook us at the top .
But we 're waiting on the sidelines .
One of our main goals is the Champions League : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way .
What is the club 's goal in this competition ?
We 'll try to go as far as possible .
From now on , anything can happen .
But we 'll have something to say against some very good European teams .
First of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match .
Can P@@ S@@ G become a top European club in the short term ?
It already has the budget ...
To become a top European club , Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time .
Today , this isn 't the case .
F@@ i@@ n@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ ally , P@@ S@@ G has the means to make it happen .
In Lig@@ ue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ?
D@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ n@@ itely , it would be a major disappointment .
This year , we 're really committed to winning the championship .
We weren 't far away last season .
In May , there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first .
It was a terrific season .
We finished with 79 points .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , 79 points is good enough to be top ...
But another team , Mont@@ p@@ e@@ l@@ lier , had an even more fantastic season .
I think this is the year .
Even if big teams like Marseille , Lyon and Bor@@ d@@ e@@ aux are competing for the title , I think we have the weapons to win .
Do you think the media expect too much of P@@ S@@ G ?
It 's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what 's been invested and the players we have .
We totally accept it .
After we won 4-@@ 0 at home against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that 's definitely a bit frustrating .
You wonder what more people expect .
You 're never going to win 4-@@ 0 every weekend .
We 're not FC Barcelona !
We 're trying to implement a game project .
It takes time to build a team .
The Champions League proved we could hold our own .
Look at Manchester City who , for two seasons , have failed to qualify for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
Based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break !
That would be to ign@@ ore our opponents and the French Championship .
Lyon and Marseille , who were no good last season , were " boosted " by the new P@@ S@@ G .
This shows that Lig@@ ue 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
P@@ S@@ G seem totally dependent on the explo@@ its of Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic .
So much so that people say there is a " Z@@ lat@@ an depen@@ dence . "
This means I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic is very successful and scores a lot of goals .
That 's why he came , and he 's proving he 's the star of Lig@@ ue 1 .
He 's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star .
Within the group , we respect the man and the player .
And also he respects the men he has around him .
What he has done is truly exc@@ e@@ p@@ tional .
It push@@ es others to raise their level of play .
T@@ h@@ i@@ ago Silva , who is one of the best defen@@ ders in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ?
A disappointment .
I really wanted to play in this Euro .
Unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time .
I saw some things there and came out stronger .
Today , I 'm playing well in selection matches .
Which is what I 've been hoping for since my b@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ ism with the Blues .
I 've learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now o@@ w@@ e it to myself to have exempl@@ ary behaviour .
What do think about Didier D@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ s 's first few months in charge of the Blues ?
He has the results he wanted .
We 're well placed in the World qualifying group .
The coach is tough , close to the players , and insp@@ ires them to win .
Like Lau@@ rent Blanc was .
But I don 't want to make any c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ ons .
Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro .
I hope Didier D@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ s will take the Blues to Brazil .
Did the good draw ( 1-1 ) sn@@ a@@ t@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ?
That match gave us confidence .
Everybody fought for everybody .
Before that shock in Spain , I 'd never experienced such a match in my career .
With B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in , pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
In addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is pal@@ p@@ able : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking m@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ p@@ o@@ lies , leads to financial cris@@ es .
In fact , B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in , invented by Sat@@ o@@ s@@ h@@ i Nak@@ amoto ( a p@@ s@@ e@@ u@@ d@@ o@@ n@@ ym ) , is both a virtual currency ( but conver@@ tible into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange proto@@ c@@ o@@ l like B@@ i@@ t@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows peer-to-peer file exchange .
Around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15,000 computers on the network .
Close to a thousand web sites accept bit@@ coins as donations or means of payment .
The bit@@ c@@ o@@ in exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a dozen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ c@@ o@@ i@@ n@@ char@@ t@@ s@@ .com site ) .
Nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products .
However , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
It describes bit@@ c@@ o@@ in as " the most successful virtual currency , " " in competition with the dollar or the euro " and " similar to conven@@ tional currencies . "
B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ ers from other types of virtual currency such as ' credits ' , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system .
But , on each occasion , a central authority controls and hand@@ les the exchanges .
With B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in , all n@@ o@@ des in the network are both cust@@ odi@@ ans of the book of accounts , auditors , currency issu@@ ers , and buyers and sellers .
How does the network operate ?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e-mail .
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anonymity .
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-@@ key e@@ n@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion system .
So the network can v@@ e@@ r@@ ify the auth@@ enti@@ city of the transaction .
Using the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network .
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book .
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers , and the winner , a kind of interim central banker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line .
This is a file h@@ ashing phase , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the transformation of a large file into a shor@@ ter and unique digital imp@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ t .
Comp@@ u@@ ters " take " the new transaction and add a number to it , then " h@@ ash " it all up .
The goal being to find the number that gives a special imp@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ t ( lots of zer@@ os at the beginning ) .
Once this number has been found , the other n@@ o@@ des can easily check that it is the right one .
The transaction is then inde@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ cti@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modi@@ fication would alter the imp@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ t .
If a user wanted to defrau@@ d by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be vali@@ dated by the network - the other would remain an orph@@ an because the two have different imp@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ts .
The computer that resol@@ ves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ coins .
To avoid inflation , this award is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
The number of bit@@ coins in cir@@ cul@@ ation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are d@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ ble down to the hundred milli@@ o@@ n@@ th , which leaves some margin ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power .
The life of the network has had its up@@ s and downs .
Web@@ sites providing services for B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in have been attacked and bit@@ coins in deposits stolen .
" The l@@ o@@ o@@ p@@ hole used is not the proto@@ c@@ o@@ l itself " says Pierre N@@ o@@ i@@ z@@ at reass@@ u@@ r@@ ingly , who has just launched Pay@@ mi@@ um , a real currency payment company that uses the B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in network .
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service .
But cash also has this weakness .
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature .
Others , such as the W@@ o@@ r@@ d@@ Press blog platform , accept them .
Rec@@ ently , Ad@@ i Sh@@ a@@ m@@ ir and Dor@@ it Ron , from the W@@ e@@ i@@ z@@ mann Institute in Israel , analy@@ sed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not cir@@ cul@@ ate .
In November , " huge s@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ offs " were launched .
" Thir@@ ty thousand dollars were exchanged " w@@ e@@ l@@ comes Jon Hol@@ m@@ quist , who works for C@@ o@@ i@@ n@@ a@@ b@@ ul , which conver@@ ts bit@@ coins to gold .
Pierre N@@ o@@ i@@ z@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
His system , Pay@@ tun@@ ia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a cont@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ less payment by mobile , but it uses B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in to vali@@ date transactions , which are thus cheaper .
Also the user m@@ a@@ n@@ ages his identity and can therefore be anonymous .
The system is easy to implement by m@@ e@@ r@@ chan@@ ts , who do not need to install new termin@@ als or software .
They just need to provide an address that a phone can " photograph and recognise " says Pierre N@@ o@@ i@@ z@@ at , who confir@@ ms he has thousands of users .
There is a general movement to r@@ e@@ app@@ raise hier@@ arch@@ ical systems for more hor@@ i@@ z@@ o@@ n@@ tal systems .
" It will take time for B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in to become firmly established , but 20@@ 13 could be a turning point , " he predic@@ ts .
The ECB , in its report , says it will reass@@ ess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency 's success .
We got out of Afghanistan .
What now ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kap@@ isa and Su@@ rob@@ i ) .
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014 .
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything .
It is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists .
And ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wounded , the m@@ a@@ i@@ m@@ ed .
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former leaders in refu@@ ge in Pakistan , but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the So@@ vie@@ ts .
They want to defend their traditions , both ancient and arch@@ a@@ ic , even though they have been joined by J@@ i@@ hadi@@ sts , Pakist@@ anis , Arabs , U@@ z@@ b@@ e@@ ks , Ta@@ ji@@ ks .
Tol@@ e@@ r@@ ated , sometimes assi@@ sted , by local insurgents , the latter will no longer be so when West@@ erners become more scar@@ ce .
The departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ r@@ a@@ b base , which I observed from the top of hills of a@@ l@@ mond trees planted with French funding , was carried out in an orderly fashion .
C@@ o@@ n@@ v@@ o@@ ys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked , over@@ flown by helicopters .
There will be no wave of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014 .
C@@ i@@ r@@ cum@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ ces have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996 .
At that time Kabul was emp@@ ty , the country being torn apart by the strugg@@ les between different fac@@ tions .
Their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liber@@ ation , a return to safety .
Af@@ g@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ is paid the price of the o@@ b@@ s@@ c@@ u@@ r@@ ant@@ ism of these peasants by the organisation of Al-Qaeda , but their situation has not improved today .
Former Mu@@ j@@ a@@ h@@ i@@ d@@ in , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are allied in the desire to keep women in an i@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ior position .
The main anti-@@ Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001 .
They became profite@@ ers , sei@@ zing government land to resell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , benef@@ iting from huge American outsourcing contracts .
They have become disc@@ red@@ ited ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves .
The people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of thie@@ ves .
Many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American lar@@ g@@ e@@ s@@ se will leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
The young people are tired of war and its i@@ d@@ e@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es .
They have r@@ u@@ b@@ bed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreciated the benefits .
Rou@@ g@@ h@@ ly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population .
In towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and boys alike .
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the o@@ b@@ s@@ c@@ u@@ r@@ ant@@ ism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders .
All of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile phones ; television , with its Turkish s@@ o@@ ap operas that show a modern world , is followed everywhere .
The army is now present .
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ?
Former commanders of the anti-@@ Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias , which will escape the central power .
Afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain dec@@ entr@@ a@@ l@@ isation , in the image of the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a cent@@ ral@@ ised State , with strong presidential power , a@@ b@@ o@@ l@@ ishing the post of Prime Minister , which had exist@@ ed since the 1964 Constitution .
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014 .
But , since the 50s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid .
No industries have been re-@@ established , no dams are in good condition , no major i@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ g@@ ation systems have been repaired .
Everything is impor@@ ted ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables .
The Pri@@ o@@ r@@ ity is left to private initiative .
In a country ruined by thir@@ ty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary .
The rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge m@@ i@@ n@@ eral wealth .
This only added to the feeling that the West@@ erners were only there to sei@@ ze it .
With no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , there is no mining .
The Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak copper mine , leaving international archaeologists ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province .
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely dep@@ end , to restore normal relations .
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation treaty provides for the cont@@ i@@ n@@ u@@ ation of traditional aid : girls ' high school , boys ' high school , French Department at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the arch@@ ae@@ ological Deleg@@ ation .
Since 2009 , to try to " win hearts and minds " and achieve the impossible task of reconc@@ iling aid and offensive actions , a " c@@ i@@ v@@ il-@@ military actions " service from the Ministry of defence ( Cim@@ ic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French NG@@ O , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages .
These projects , involving large numbers of local lab@@ our , have helped to contain the insurgency : i@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ g@@ ation , wells , drinking water , r@@ e@@ forest@@ ation , fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cul@@ tiv@@ able areas .
What will we leave as a souven@@ ir , after two billion euros of military spending ?
A much more modest budget would contribute to impro@@ ving local living conditions , which are very hard in these v@@ alle@@ ys often located over 2,000 metres above sea level .
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kap@@ isa province .
To be in a position to free themselves from the up@@ rising led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them .
A Constitution by force in Egypt
A new gam@@ ble for President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
Taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the Const@@ itu@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day .
Just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work .
For two years Egypt has reli@@ ed on a provisional text , a@@ m@@ ended several times and this has weak@@ ened institutional stability and led to legal i@@ m@@ bro@@ gli@@ os .
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divi@@ de in the country .
According to his opponents , the President is p@@ e@@ r@@ sever@@ ing in his " auto@@ cratic del@@ i@@ r@@ i@@ um , " continuing to " go back on his word " and ' tramp@@ le the law . "
His supporters a@@ f@@ f@@ irm that this is the quick@@ est way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by spe@@ eding up the transition process .
A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks .
A very short period , which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the Egypti@@ ans .
For the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitim@@ acy while the dispute r@@ a@@ ges throughout the country .
Mohammed Mor@@ si seems convinced that Egypti@@ ans will vote favour@@ ably , as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time .
P@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ cul@@ arly since a h@@ a@@ sty vote sm@@ acks of an ultimatum to the Egyptian people : " Either you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , " these powers sup@@ posedly e@@ x@@ p@@ iring following adoption of the Constitution .
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Const@@ itu@@ ent Assembly , with a large Islam@@ ist majority , voted on the text yesterday .
Most of the liber@@ als were missing .
In mid-@@ November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had slammed the door , feeling they had failed to asser@@ t their views .
Representatives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ wise .
In order to obtain a q@@ u@@ o@@ r@@ um , 11 members , altern@@ ates , were hastily added yesterday morning .
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood .
Not surpris@@ ingly , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously .
C@@ o@@ m@@ ment@@ ators were also a@@ m@@ used that one of the only diver@@ sions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of prayer , some Committee members feeling that the Const@@ itu@@ ent Assembly clock was wrong .
The text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 234 articles .
The main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , s@@ t@@ ip@@ u@@ l@@ ating that " the principles of shar@@ ia are the main source of law . "
The Sal@@ a@@ f@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace " the principles " by " the rules , " which would have allowed s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ ter application .
For the Islam@@ ists , the fact that this article was not a@@ m@@ ended is a guarantee of their good@@ will and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society .
" Hy@@ pocris@@ y " respond the liber@@ als , who see only a communication coup .
Because in their opinion Islam@@ isation of the Constitution is done through other articles .
They refer in particular to article 220 , which grants Al-@@ Az@@ h@@ ar University an advisory role , with particular reference to v@@ e@@ r@@ if@@ ying the c@@ o@@ n@@ formity of the laws with shar@@ ia .
According to Egypt specialist Sop@@ h@@ ie Pom@@ m@@ ier , this is w@@ o@@ r@@ rying because " the people called upon to adv@@ ise are not elected and have no democratic legitim@@ acy .
This suggests the beg@@ innings of a the@@ oc@@ r@@ a@@ cy . "
The liber@@ als ' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next Rec@@ tor of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one .
" For the time being , there is no concrete religious imp@@ lication .
With this Constitution , things remain under civil rule .
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law scholars but academics , some trained in the French system " qualifi@@ es Alexis Bl@@ o@@ u@@ et , who is writing a t@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ is on the Egyptian constitutional transition .
But he acknowledges that " there may be some ambig@@ uity regarding article 220 , because the terms used bor@@ row from the religious voc@@ abul@@ ary .
R@@ e@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ence is made in particular to " f@@ i@@ q@@ h " [ Islamic j@@ u@@ r@@ isp@@ r@@ u@@ dence , Editor 's note ] .
And the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pron@@ ounce on it . "
Beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic .
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime .
Another issue : the powers c@@ o@@ n@@ ferred on the army .
In accordance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but to a National Defence Council .
Nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military t@@ r@@ i@@ bun@@ als , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
Who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider repres@@ sive .
The offence of b@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ p@@ h@@ e@@ m@@ y is maintained and insul@@ ts are now prohib@@ ited , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
In addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights Heb@@ a Mor@@ aye@@ f , from Human Rights Watch .
In her opinion , the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36 .
The word was not included in the previous Constitution .
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
Sup@@ porters of the Head of State will march on Saturday .
In Israel , holy places await U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ian tourists , the o@@ m@@ p@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ os and a sea of sal@@ ine water
The Holy Land combin@@ es the spl@@ end@@ our of bib@@ lical tru@@ ths , modern comfort and p@@ r@@ i@@ m@@ e@@ val nature .
A@@ i@@ F [ A@@ r@@ gum@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i i F@@ a@@ k@@ ti ] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel .
Let 's worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the River Jordan where J@@ e@@ s@@ us was b@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ i@@ zed .
It is considered that all who enter this b@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ ism " b@@ ath " are blessed by God .
Gal@@ i@@ l@@ e@@ e is the place where J@@ e@@ s@@ us performed his magic : turned water into wine at a wedding , walked on water , calmed a storm , and filled the nets .
This is also where J@@ e@@ s@@ us came before his dis@@ ciples and after the resur@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ tion .
But the biggest number of holy places is in Jerusalem .
Belie@@ vers walk through the Way of Gri@@ e@@ f or Via Dol@@ o@@ r@@ o@@ sa .
It starts by the Anton@@ ia Fort@@ ress - Pra@@ e@@ t@@ orium - where the judgement took place , and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sep@@ u@@ l@@ c@@ h@@ re on Gol@@ g@@ o@@ tha - the place of the cruci@@ fix@@ ion , Stone of U@@ n@@ ction and the place of J@@ e@@ s@@ us ' burial .
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian o@@ m@@ p@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ os , which s@@ y@@ m@@ b@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ zes the sal@@ vation of m@@ a@@ n@@ kind .
The Holy Cross Monast@@ ery in Jerusalem is e@@ r@@ ected at the site that , according to Christian l@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ d , y@@ i@@ e@@ l@@ ded the tree used to make the cross for J@@ e@@ s@@ us ' cruci@@ fix@@ ion .
Jerusalem has the most holy places for the Jews as well - the W@@ ail@@ ing Wall , which remained from a temp@@ le destroyed by the Rom@@ ans in 70 AD .
According to tradition , people of different fa@@ iths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled .
Travel along a vertical
Ru@@ ins of the Mas@@ s@@ a@@ da Fort@@ ress remain from a secret refu@@ ge from enemies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family .
They are located on cli@@ ffs in the mountains at an elev@@ ation of 450 m above sea level .
They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing .
Others are delivered to this historical moun@@ tain@@ top by a cab@@ l@@ e@@ way .
In the north of the country , at an elev@@ ation of 16@@ 00-@@ 20@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which f@@ ills up with tourists in winter months .
A shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain .
The total length of ski pist@@ es is 45 km .
According to an ancient l@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ d , p@@ a@@ g@@ an g@@ o@@ ds used to live on the mountain .

This country has about 300 museums .
You won 't be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit .
Among them - Museum of Israel , located close to Kn@@ e@@ s@@ set ( Parliament ) .
It has ancient Q@@ u@@ m@@ ran m@@ a@@ n@@ uscri@@ p@@ ts and Dead Sea s@@ c@@ rolls found in the caves of the Ju@@ dean desert , along with about 500,000 arch@@ ae@@ ological and anthro@@ polo@@ gical a@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ facts .
The Museum of Art in Tel@@ -@@ Aviv is also interesting .
Its exhib@@ its include a wide range of impres@@ sion@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like M@@ o@@ n@@ et , P@@ iss@@ a@@ r@@ ro , Ren@@ o@@ ir , S@@ i@@ s@@ ley , C@@ ez@@ anne , Mat@@ isse , M@@ o@@ dig@@ l@@ i@@ ani , C@@ h@@ a@@ g@@ all , Picasso .
In Ak@@ ko , you can visit the b@@ ath museum Al-@@ Bash@@ a , which consi@@ sts of several rooms of ancient Turkish b@@ ath@@ s with models of visitors and b@@ ath atten@@ d@@ ants of the time .
In Caes@@ area , it is worth visiting the unique private R@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i Museum , where you can enjoy the sculp@@ tures of D@@ a@@ l@@ i and Rod@@ in .
There are no tour guides or gift shops .
E@@ n@@ try is free of charge , and contributions are strictly not allowed .
The fifth one is the Holocau@@ st Museum or Y@@ ad V@@ a@@ s@@ h@@ em in Tel@@ -@@ Aviv , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
The most tragic section is the children 's memorial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentr@@ ation camps and gas chambers .
You go in and find yourself in complete darkness .
Stars are g@@ lim@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ ing ,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died .
Ukraine is mentioned there too .
Well@@ ness
There are three resort areas in Israel , located on the coasts of the Mediterranean , Red , and Dead Se@@ as .
Each have swimming pools , aqu@@ a parks , dol@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ aria and oc@@ ean@@ aria .
It is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees .
The Dead Sea is even warmer , and people swim in it all year round .
I@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ dent@@ ally , it is the most unusual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the planet - 4@@ 17 m below sea level .
Its az@@ ure water is sal@@ ine and easily keeps you afloat , even if you don 't know how to swim .
The surrounding landscap@@ es are surreal in their beauty .
People come here to undergo a course of treatment using salt water - wraps and medic@@ i@@ n@@ al m@@ u@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have dermat@@ itis , aller@@ gies , a@@ s@@ t@@ h@@ m@@ as , e@@ c@@ z@@ emas , arth@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ is , b@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ c@@ h@@ itis , or diabetes , or to return emotional balance .
Tou@@ ch the my@@ ster@@ ies of anti@@ quity
They are p@@ r@@ e@@ served in the old section of Tel@@ -@@ Aviv - in the town of J@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ a on the Mediterranean Sea .
The famous sea route connecting Egypt , Syria , Anatoli@@ a , and Mes@@ opotam@@ ia runs through it .
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legen@@ ds .
According to legen@@ ds , this is where Noah built his a@@ r@@ k and Per@@ s@@ e@@ us saved the beauty A@@ n@@ dro@@ m@@ eda , with whom he lived a long and happy life .
Tour@@ ists really like to wan@@ der the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ d@@ i@@ a@@ c .
They say , if you touch the walls on the street of your sign , fortune will come to you .
In J@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ a , you can meet new@@ ly@@ w@@ e@@ ds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions .
And in Caes@@ area - the city of King Her@@ od - you can walk around a Roman theatre , " capture " the Cru@@ s@@ a@@ der fort@@ ress .
During the Roman period , Caes@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ dea and the residence of Roman p@@ r@@ e@@ f@@ ects , including Pon@@ t@@ i@@ us P@@ i@@ l@@ ate .
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening conc@@ erts and opera performances .
A note for the tourist
When you go to Israel , don 't worry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country 's population speaks Russian .
For the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily exchanged for s@@ h@@ ek@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3.@@ 8 s@@ h@@ ek@@ els ) .
City transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high-@@ speed t@@ r@@ a@@ m , and Ha@@ if@@ a has the only subway line in the country , c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ rising six stops and connecting upper town with lower .
In essence , it is an underground cable railway .
A ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 s@@ h@@ ek@@ els , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers .
According to the Jewish tradition , Sab@@ b@@ ath is celebrated in Israel .
Between Friday evening and the sun@@ set on Saturday , markets , stores , and public transportation stop working .
The work week starts on Sunday morning .
Many caf@@ es , restaurants and hotels have only k@@ o@@ s@@ h@@ er food , with no pork , seaf@@ ood , fish with no s@@ c@@ ales , or dish@@ es that combine milk with meat .
There is a wide selection of dish@@ es from lam@@ b and beef , sou@@ ps and d@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ ts c@@ o@@ oked using c@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ ut milk , traditional Jewish hum@@ m@@ us pa@@ ste , various sau@@ ces , fal@@ a@@ f@@ el ( balls made of ground c@@ h@@ ick@@ peas ) , fru@@ its and vegetables .
The streets of Israel don 't have homeless dogs .
But there are many w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ -f@@ ed cats , which walk around l@@ a@@ z@@ ily .
In the evening , they can even be seen sleeping on roofs of p@@ a@@ r@@ ked cars .
These pus@@ s@@ y@@ cats like busy places and do not refuse treats .
C@@ ar rental , depending on car type , costs from 37 ( Hy@@ undai G@@ e@@ t@@ z ) to 188 ( Audi A@@ 6 , Vol@@ vo S@@ 80 ) dollars a day .
P@@ lus insurance of 15 dollars a day .
Bi@@ ke rental costs 15 s@@ h@@ ek@@ els a day .
Museum entrance costs 30 s@@ h@@ ek@@ els on average .
In numbers
In 2012 , over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel .
Visitors and h@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ day@@ makers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , and Ukraine .
Between January and October 2012 1@@ 18,@@ 800 U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ian tourists visited the Holy Land , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 2011 .
Only the " high and m@@ igh@@ ty " make it to Moscow : mig@@ rants save money for language
While deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has scam artists who sell f@@ ake certi@@ fic@@ ates .
Every year , 13 million mig@@ rant workers come to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia .
M@@ o@@ s@@ t@@ ly these are citizens of Central Asia : U@@ z@@ b@@ e@@ k@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an , Ta@@ j@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an and Tur@@ k@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an .
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home .
A new law came into effect on December 1 , which o@@ b@@ lig@@ es every mig@@ rant worker to pass a Russian language test .
For the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility services , household services , and retail .
But with time - as promised by the Federal M@@ i@@ g@@ ration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non-@@ residents .
In addition to language , Russian history and basics of the legal system will be tested .
Lan@@ g@@ u@@ age knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit .
An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language .
People who received education certi@@ fic@@ ates and diplom@@ as before the fall of the U@@ S@@ S@@ R in 1991 are also exempt under the law .
Pur@@ pose , doomed fate , and the protection of rights
Seven testing points will be operating under the a@@ u@@ s@@ p@@ ices of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian Lan@@ g@@ u@@ age , Pe@@ oples ' Friendship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St. Petersburg State University ( S@@ P@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions .
M@@ i@@ g@@ rants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such cent@@ res have been opened .
The initiative to intro@@ duce the testing was supported by State Dum@@ a members and the Federal M@@ i@@ g@@ ration Services .
But human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non-@@ residents ?
First of all , according to representatives of the mig@@ ration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from lab@@ our sla@@ very .
Many speak about protection of the rights of work mig@@ rants , explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal M@@ i@@ g@@ ration Services of Russia , Viktor S@@ e@@ b@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ v .
Rights protection should begin before their departure .
Only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
M@@ i@@ g@@ rants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certi@@ ficate start to have problems .
If a mig@@ rant does not understand the language , says S@@ e@@ b@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ v with certainty , he is doomed to come across uncon@@ sci@@ enti@@ ous people , who , p@@ r@@ e@@ tending to help , will force upon him a " ticket " to terrible , cra@@ mped bar@@ racks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sla@@ ving away 12-@@ 14 hours a day .
We receive many complaints from our mig@@ rants .
" They are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their passports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , " confir@@ ms the Head of the Main M@@ i@@ g@@ rant Labour Administration of the M@@ i@@ g@@ ration Service of Ta@@ j@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an T@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ b Shar@@ i@@ p@@ o@@ v .
Not be angry , boss !
Non@@ etheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Turks , U@@ z@@ b@@ e@@ ks , and Ta@@ ji@@ ks can afford even a basic education .
Their families don 't even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies .
After reaching a@@ d@@ o@@ l@@ escence , these kids go to work at the first opportunity .
It is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit .
" You feel hum@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ated and i@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ior . "
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language .
Test@@ ing will be conducted only for those mig@@ rants who have legal status .
If they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future .
In the meantime , most of the mig@@ rant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
" Wel@@ come , or No Unauthorized E@@ n@@ try "
Many of the foreigners asser@@ t that receiving official status in our country is not that easy .
The reason lies in bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and the already mentioned language difficulties .
In addition , leg@@ alization costs money : from 12,000 to 16,000 r@@ u@@ bles .
W@@ here@@ as a f@@ ake regist@@ ration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand .
Officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have f@@ ake papers , without regist@@ ration , hence the extortion .
" They ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes , tea , " Um@@ ed K@@ h@@ ush@@ k@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ o@@ v , a citi@@ zen of Ta@@ j@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an , shared with journalists .
" Roll up , don 't be cheap , get your artwork "
On the first day of the law 's entry into effect it turned out that not only mig@@ rant regist@@ ration documents can be f@@ ake .
A few forged certi@@ fic@@ ates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal M@@ i@@ g@@ ration Services officers already .
F@@ o@@ r@@ ged documents are printed on a standard colour prin@@ ter .
N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , they were not free for their owners : each of the mig@@ rants , who had hoped to fac@@ ilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand r@@ u@@ bles for them .
It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand .
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certi@@ fic@@ ates could not just be bought .
For the moment , the authorities can promise mig@@ rant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
In addition , those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into cir@@ cul@@ ation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tou@@ g@@ hen up the law for owners of civil weapons .
This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : CL@@ IC@@ K shots at wed@@ dings , where there were no casualties , and the massac@@ re staged by Moscow lawyer Dmit@@ ry Vin@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ o@@ v , resulting in CL@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people .
Poli@@ c@@ e@@ m@@ en want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 .
The idea was supported by the head of the Dum@@ a Committee on Safety and Anti-@@ Cor@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion , Ir@@ ina Y@@ aro@@ v@@ a@@ y@@ a , who promised that the amend@@ ments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Dum@@ a in the near future .
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by " tightening the scre@@ ws . "
An open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of different social rifle organizations - demand to abandon the " s@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ ess tou@@ g@@ h@@ ening . "
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal , said criminal lawyer V@@ a@@ s@@ ily Les@@ nik@@ ov to BBC Russia .
According to the Ministry of the Interior 's statist@@ ics , 142 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , wher@@ e@@ as 1@@ ,@@ 16@@ 8,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period .
Auth@@ ors of the open letter are certain that the tou@@ g@@ h@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the " black " market .
According to them , one can find any weapon at a low price right now .
Non@@ etheless , the Ministry of the Interior asser@@ ts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control .
Supp@@ l@@ i@@ ers : from plants to officers
The " black " market of weapons is r@@ e@@ p@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ ished through several channels .
There are five such channels , explains retired col@@ onel Viktor Bar@@ a@@ n@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years .
Scre@@ e@@ n@@ shot of the site that accepts orders for weapons .
First : " army or military loo@@ t , " i@@ .@@ e@@ . weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus .
" We@@ a@@ p@@ ons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Cau@@ casi@@ ans , " says Bar@@ a@@ n@@ ets .
Next are " black weapons , " stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies .
Bar@@ a@@ n@@ ets explains that this covers weapons taken from police w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies ' employees .
Il@@ legal arms are taken to be sold from military w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses .
E@@ x@@ plo@@ sions have often been heard at military w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses .
" There are proven the@@ ories that some of the fires were intentional , in order to cover the shortage , " says the former military man .
Manufacturers of weapons make their contribution , according to Bar@@ a@@ n@@ ets .
" There are so many private weapons factories now , which do not endur@@ e competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , " says the expert .
Another source of the " black " market is traff@@ icking .
An especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyr@@ gy@@ zstan .
" There 's production there , sometimes hand@@ made ; and a m@@ afia has formed , which has organized a stream , " explains the former military man .
Where do the weapons come from ?
Experts counted the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the " black " market .
A report about this was prepared by the Centre of P@@ r@@ o@@ ble@@ ms A@@ n@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ sis and Public Management Pl@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ ing in 2011 .
Experts analy@@ sed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Ros@@ stat , cri@@ minology literature and open data from port@@ als on weapons .
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
Half of all arms on the black market are there " because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , " states the report .
According to researchers ' data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is theft during production , 5 % is " black arch@@ ae@@ ology . "
A sales consultant of one of the weapons stores , who wished to remain anonymous , asser@@ ts that the weapons found by " black " dig@@ gers are not being bought any more , because they 're too old .
According to him , dealers go to the military warehouse for a new bat@@ ch of goods .
One piece , for example a T@@ T gun can be bought from a warrant officer .
It is issued to him , and given through the fence .
" He takes it to the city and sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines , " he says .
" The truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why perio@@ dic@@ ally , when the crime d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ction rate is low , it conduc@@ ts test purchases from illegal weapons m@@ e@@ r@@ chan@@ ts , " says the consultant .
" Like in a luxury store "
The buyer and seller often find each other through friends .
I looked at sites , blogs , t@@ ill someone responded , offering me to go to B@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ a@@ y@@ a station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the " corner " so we can negoti@@ ate .
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military comment@@ ator Viktor Bar@@ a@@ n@@ ets
To get a weapon , I need someone with conne@@ ctions , says the sales consultant . - I have an acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ tance , but I 'm not sure it 's reliable .
There are sal@@ e@@ s@@ men on lab@@ our markets , but one needs to " come " there conditi@@ onally " from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a t@@ o@@ o@@ th . "
Right now , even if I need a few knu@@ c@@ k@@ l@@ e@@ d@@ u@@ sters , I get them through someone I trust .
He also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won 't give him away .
Beg@@ inners look for weapons in different ways .
Former military man Viktor Bar@@ a@@ n@@ ets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-@@ 1990 's , when he was preparing to publish an article about this .
The f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ as are still the same , according to him .
He was given an album of pictures with " anything and everything . "
" I felt like I was in a luxury store , " he recalls .
According to Bar@@ a@@ n@@ ets , the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke - you can try out everything .
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there .
" I am given the opportunity to shoot , and when I am certain that the weapon is good , we begin to negoti@@ ate , " describes the expert .
Store on a sofa
Internet searches lead to sites and " V@@ k@@ o@@ n@@ tak@@ te " groups , where weapons " for different purposes " are on offer .
No documents or personal meetings are needed .
" It 's enough to have a certain sum of money , " says the advertisement heading on the website " Buy a pistol or rifle . "
Users leave their requests and ask questions .
Can a minor buy ?
" Without a license , of course , " asks user " John " ( name is changed ) .
" Want to buy a T@@ T , Moscow , " conc@@ isely requests " Fed@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ k@@ o@@ v . "
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of f@@ ake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
People come like hungry fish to ba@@ it , and then mine coal in Siber@@ ia .
military comment@@ ator and former military man Viktor Bar@@ a@@ n@@ ets
I heard about this : normally the site is registered outside the area of app@@ lic@@ ability of the laws of Russia .
People accept orders .
The buyer pays at an AT@@ M .
" In response , a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden , " says Press Secretary of the Rights to We@@ a@@ p@@ ons non-@@ governmental organization Dmit@@ ry Kis@@ l@@ o@@ v .
Viktor Bar@@ a@@ n@@ ets confir@@ ms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to jail .
The Federal Security Service now s@@ p@@ reads a big network of f@@ ake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
" People are like hungry fish after ba@@ it , and end in Siber@@ ia mining coal , " - he says .
Mak@@ aro@@ v for 100 dollars
When buying illegal firearms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts .
According to Dmit@@ ry Kis@@ l@@ o@@ v from the Rights to We@@ a@@ p@@ ons organization , a Mak@@ aro@@ v gun can be acquired for 100@@ -@@ 300 dollars .
The wait time is a month to a month and a half .
It is shipped from long-term storage w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses by the mid-@@ level management of these w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses .
According to official statist@@ ics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to Jan@@ u@@ ary-@@ October 2011 , a@@ m@@ o@@ unting to 22,@@ 900 , while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons , ammunition , explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7.@@ 8 % .
F@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ food and supermarket workers are on strike in the U.S@@ .A .
Up to a fourth of all American teenagers have worked the cash register at McDonald 's at one time or another
In the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U.S@@ .A. against low salaries in supermarkets of the Wal@@ mart chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like McDonald 's , Bur@@ ger King , Tac@@ o Bell , Wendy 's and Kentucky Fri@@ ed Chic@@ ken .
Right now , nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ined to f@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ le out early .
Ac@@ tions are being supported by unions and a series of left-wing organizations .
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ mart and fast food chains , the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them .
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet .
46 cents a year ?
Ac@@ tions began last week after Thanksgiving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
On this day , some employees of the Wal@@ mart corpor@@ ation , which employs 2.2 million people around the world , left their work@@ places and p@@ ick@@ eted together with the unions and left-wing activists from the corpor@@ ation stores that sell products to people on low-@@ to-@@ medium incomes .
Wal@@ mart sells everything imag@@ i@@ n@@ able , from d@@ i@@ a@@ p@@ ers , hunting rif@@ les and car batter@@ ies , to vacu@@ um clean@@ ers , eggs and milk .
Products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major supermarkets .
So many low-@@ paid Wal@@ mart employees shop only at their work@@ place .
Avail@@ ability and a@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ ment made Wal@@ mart one of the biggest American corporations .
According to critics , Wal@@ mart can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees .
These latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand-@@ held scanners .
Protest@@ ers on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corpor@@ ation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
A typical Wal@@ mart employee , receiving 9.@@ 5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
Scienti@@ sts from the Berkeley University in California argue that if Wal@@ mart raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corpor@@ ation 3.@@ 2 billion dollars .
This is about 1.1 % more than it spends on salaries right now .
If Wal@@ mart fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more .
In one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now .
Wal@@ mart supporters happ@@ ily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corpor@@ ation .
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday t@@ ill midnight the next day , and during the period Wal@@ mart sold about 5000 products a second .
In total , its cash regist@@ ers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday .
Representative of the corpor@@ ation , Dan Fo@@ g@@ e@@ l@@ man , asserted in an interview with a left-wing site , the Huff@@ ington Post , that a total of " less than five " Wal@@ mart employees left the work@@ place , and the protest act was just " another PR trick " of the union that organized it .
" Free cash register ! "
Protests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ mart ( they 're not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they don 't exist here yet ) , but McDonald 's and other cheap restaurants .
McDonald 's says that it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work !
J@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ ane Williams , member of the City Council of New York
At the moment , the minimum salary according to federal and NY law is 7.@@ 25 dollars an hour .
Fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour .
Nobody e@@ a@@ r@@ ns less in this expensive city .
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money .
Once upon a time , almost a fourth of American teenagers went through McDonald 's , working part-time after school , living with parents .
Few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long .
Now I continuously come across interviews with McDonald 's employees , who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children .
On the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them .
Participants of the protest that began at 6.@@ 30 a.m. on Thursday near the McDonald 's on 40@@ th street and Madison Avenue demanded that cash@@ i@@ ers and c@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ s of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i@@ .@@ e@@ . more than double their present wages .
They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry .
American law prohib@@ its the administration from preventing this or punishing activists of the union movement by nag@@ ging or firing .
On the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life .
But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union .
One of them is the unusual turnover of employees .
Dis@@ agreeing
N@@ o@@ isy protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near McDonald 's by Times Square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . One of them , J@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ ane Williams , said : " McDonald 's claims it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! "
Demon@@ strators were supported by other prominent NY d@@ e@@ m@@ o@@ c@@ rats , like Bill de Bla@@ s@@ i@@ o , a candidate for NY city mayor , who said : " We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ being , which every New Yor@@ ker deserves ! . "
According to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
But only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York .
It is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement .
" At the moment , the mind cannot be dec@@ e@@ i@@ ved too well "
Among modern technology fans a popular topic is augmented reality , lately seen primarily through the pris@@ m of special gl@@ asses .
At first , a functional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . Then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for pat@@ ent too .
However , according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft , Shah@@ ram Iz@@ a@@ d@@ i , gl@@ asses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .
They are drawn by the prospect of manipul@@ ating virtual objects in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open spaces .
- Please tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does .
- We work on the interaction of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction .
While people in general are stuck at working with pi@@ x@@ els on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them .
We want to look 5-@@ 10 years into the future and predict cardin@@ al changes in this interaction .
For example , Xbox and Kin@@ ect sens@@ ors are a step forward . Almost no Xbox is sold without Kin@@ ect today , because everyone likes control by gest@@ ures .
- What else awa@@ its us in the future ?
- Despite the fact that Kin@@ ect shifted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
Information entry has improved ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .

We need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible .
But for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him .
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form .
Above all , get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets !
- What do you think about voice control ?
It 's a popular thing , but is it over@@ estimated ?
- It clearly cannot be called a cu@@ re-@@ for-@@ all - there 's a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and inten@@ tions .
In reality , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own n@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ e .
For example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
M@@ o@@ v@@ ements were not recorded by a camera , but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and mus@@ cles .
It 's big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch .
In general , the future lies in the mixed control , e.@@ g. movement + voice .
- What do you mean ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water ?
You will talk and show at the same time .
- Usu@@ ally I just say .
- Oh , that will be very hard to detect .
- So you want to make the users adap@@ t to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mut@@ ual a@@ p@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ m@@ ation .
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sens@@ ors that will enable more precise determination of a person 's reaction .
This could be , e.@@ g. l@@ a@@ s@@ er sens@@ ors . They have a decent depth resolution , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kin@@ ect sens@@ ors , what are your complaints about modern cameras ?
Not enough resolution , depth or something else ?
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three-@@ dimen@@ s@@ i@@ onal recognition .
Of course , it would be good to have eight mega pi@@ x@@ els with 1000 k / s speed .
It 's not just the mega pi@@ x@@ els , though , but the quality of the m@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ x and the depth .
From the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the a@@ l@@ g@@ ori@@ t@@ h@@ m desig@@ ners .
So it 's important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z a@@ xis .
Speed , the number of images per second , is also very important .
Human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gest@@ ures .
Steven B@@ ath@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ e from our Red@@ mond laboratory created a touch sens@@ or with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sens@@ ors are closer to the latter indicator ( 60-@@ 100 ) .
Not everyone under@@ stands how this affects the interaction between man and machine .
In my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second .
- Does the number of cameras need to be increased ?
- In Kin@@ ect there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an i@@ n@@ fra@@ red emit@@ ter and the second one , the recipient of the signal .
The third one is actually a regular sens@@ or of visible range .
It is not applied to determine the object 's depth .
P@@ o@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ ally , a large number of cameras could solve the problem ...
Or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calculations .
It would be nice to create a flexible a@@ n@@ alo@@ gue Kin@@ ect , play with the fle@@ x@@ ion of camera d@@ i@@ spo@@ s@@ ition and see how this will help in three-@@ dimen@@ s@@ i@@ onal determination of the position .
- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its gl@@ asses to the public , unlike Google .
Don 't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augmented reality technologies ?
- Cer@@ tain@@ ly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the cool@@ est option would be " trans@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ onal " augmented reality , where you could shift from gl@@ asses to smart phone , proj@@ ection display , and everywhere else based on a cl@@ oud platform .
Gl@@ asses are a very personal device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - augmented reality based on gl@@ asses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people .
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipul@@ ation of virtual h@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ graph@@ ic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Star@@ k from I@@ ron@@ man , but to a regular person .
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out : no tac@@ t@@ ile feedback !
Hands feel nothing !
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge ?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine .
I think that the eighth will probably be the addition of tac@@ t@@ ile sens@@ ations .
For now , one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of m@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ x for the image .
It is great at regist@@ ering push@@ es !
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these " images in the air " a sense of tan@@ g@@ i@@ bility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultr@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ und rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sens@@ ation , but very weak right now , as if someone blew on your finger@@ tip .
There are also w@@ rist bracel@@ ets that affect the ner@@ ve end@@ ings in fingers , which is also a promising area .
- Have you tried to dec@@ eive the mind ?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ?
- This is a good idea and we haven 't tried this yet .
It conc@@ e@@ als one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limit@@ less space ; we are working on the concept of t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ m@@ ills ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant ballo@@ ons .
So far dec@@ e@@ i@@ ving the mind has had limited success , there 's work for many years to come .
That 's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beg@@ innings .
Jud@@ gement calls instead of culture - Ros@@ bal@@ t@@ .@@ ru
Ros@@ b@@ alt continues the project St. Petersburg Av@@ ant-@@ gar@@ de , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the avant-garde of culture and art .
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , byp@@ assing fame in Russia .
The new player in Ros@@ b@@ alt - the bold artist Kir@@ ill Miller .
The whole city knows Kir@@ ill Miller , a b@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ ded man dressed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Museum , or by the Sum@@ mer Garden , or at fashionable parties and shows .
Kir@@ ill Miller 's work always brings in crowds of people , no matter where they are exhibited .
Kir@@ ill Miller is one of the pu@@ rely St. Petersburg social and p@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ p@@ h@@ ical stor@@ y@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ers and creators of new my@@ t@@ h@@ ology .
Kir@@ ill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80 's early 90 's .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , he is a city man , who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone 's spirit .
Rec@@ ently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg 's music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his Boh@@ e@@ m@@ ian existence , philosophy and image .
- Kir@@ ill , why do you walk around the city all in red , not yellow or t@@ u@@ r@@ quo@@ ise , for example ?
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image .
In this world , red is a compromise between artist , image-@@ maker and society .
Although in society , everything that is not grey causes aggression and a@@ g@@ itation of the bad kind .
But my p@@ r@@ o@@ voc@@ ations are aimed at starting conversation .
The whole history of my p@@ r@@ o@@ voc@@ ative actions is an invitation to discussion .
- When did you real@@ ise that you must be an artist ?
- At an exhibition in the N@@ e@@ vsky House of Cul@@ ture , where my work was displayed .
It became clear to me that this is my path .
Then , the wave of older free , unofficial artists was gone , while new , free artists like me were not understood .
I became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post-@@ Gaz@@ a-@@ N@@ e@@ vsky style artists ( " post-@@ ga@@ z@@ o@@ n@@ e@@ v@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ ina " ) , which led to Push@@ kin@@ s@@ k@@ a@@ y@@ a-@@ 10 , and the wave was no longer .
I 'm drawn to theatre , clothing , music , all g@@ e@@ n@@ res except for literature .
- And all this has been united in your A@@ r@@ t-@@ clinic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
In 1995 , I occupied the territory on Push@@ kin@@ s@@ k@@ a@@ y@@ a-@@ 10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a Boh@@ e@@ m@@ ian club , the house of the St. Petersburg Boh@@ e@@ m@@ ia .
Many were born there : NO@@ My , Tequila Jazz , I remember when Sh@@ n@@ ur was brought there with the Van Go@@ gh 's E@@ ar project .
Sh@@ n@@ ur and his friends l@@ i@@ p sang easy songs , wearing tight l@@ e@@ ot@@ ards , and the now trend@@ y composer Igor V@@ d@@ o@@ vin was with them .
When the group began to play live , it became Len@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ d .
Tra@@ k@@ h@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ berg was the presenter of many programs before Hali@@ -@@ Gal@@ i times .
We gave them Tra@@ k@@ h@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ berg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and ment@@ oring he received from us .
Galler@@ y D 13@@ 7 , Gri@@ b@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ d@@ o@@ v club - all these e@@ c@@ h@@ o the A@@ r@@ t-@@ clinic .
That is where our staff and regular customers left for .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something .
In 2000 , there was a poll in the press , for the People of Our City prize .
I was nominated A@@ r@@ tist of the Year , my cli@@ m@@ a@@ x came to an end .
In the new times , it is uncomfortable to work by old rules . I 'm a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century .
In our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . You can be popular , but not very cultural .
- Your work is marked by a recogn@@ izable style .
- Many of my works are hits , with clearly reflected rele@@ vance and acu@@ ity .
I will have a programme exhibit , " Russian museum in c@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ns . "
C@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ns are a tim@@ eless category .
I was social before , now it is painful and scary to be like that .
But everything is blur@@ red in c@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ns , tragedy is removed .
I like g@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ e@@ s@@ que , I have g@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ e@@ s@@ que ideas .
For example , saving the world by t@@ o@@ tal@@ itar@@ ian changing of clothes by order .
Now@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s , people are judged by appearance , not their inner qualities .
Who knows , maybe you cannot shake his hand , and need to spit in his face .
And the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes .
- Rec@@ ently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a character .
Who fits the role better than I ?
- Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful ?
- Now@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s , commercial art should be neat , consider@@ ate , sweet .
There is a dis@@ integration of cul@@ tures .
People used to get together in flo@@ cks , Boh@@ e@@ m@@ ians liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
Now , everybody is divided into mic@@ ro s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ ties , it 's hard to be liked by everyone .
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all .
Now you have to think who you will please .
Now , each cult hero has 100 fans .
- But several thousand come to S@@ t@@ as Mik@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ v !
- The cast@@ -@@ outs go to see him , the sexu@@ al-@@ social sphere is at work there .
But 300 people will come for culture , not 10,000 . In the end , there 's less management , money , everything dies out .
I have fans ; the main thing is not to betra@@ y them , not to spo@@ il what I have earned .
In my youth , I painted such art that one colle@@ ctor had it hanging on the same wall with Fal@@ k and Lar@@ ion@@ ov .
I started with paintings , which people usually end with .
Conc@@ e@@ p@@ ts are often mixed up these days .
People say : spiritu@@ al culture , consumer culture .
There is no culture in consu@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ ism , it 's " from another opera . "
I am a man of yesterday 's culture . I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of pain@@ ting .
This is the culture I 'm for .
- Kir@@ ill , what is St. Petersburg missing ?
- Good cultural experts .
There is such a thing : an official for culture .
But not everyone can be engaged in culture .
Under the right rulers everything was different . Kings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts .
There are good consultants in Moscow right now .
Here in St. Petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will cor@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ tly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
Jud@@ gement calls are what thrive now .
Even E@@ r@@ art , but they 're different because they say hon@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ly that we don 't accept all modern art . There are some artists , who need to find other museums for themselves .
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you ?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is bedro@@ ck there .
It 's hard for art to grow on our rocks .
We need cultural bedro@@ ck , but we now have more writers than readers . This is wrong .
In Europe , there are many c@@ u@@ r@@ ious people , who go to art exhib@@ its , conc@@ erts .
Here , this layer is thin .
We need to make art fashionable , as it was in the beginning of last century .
The project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant .
Give birth in space
The earth is in danger .
Global warming or an encounter with a killer a@@ s@@ t@@ ero@@ id .
Car@@ a@@ v@@ ans of cosmic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet .
To save hum@@ a@@ n@@ ity , the question is how to prop@@ a@@ g@@ ate our race in conditions of weightlessness or on that replacement planet ?
I think the choice is small .
There are only two actual plan@@ ets that can be explo@@ red even hy@@ pothe@@ tically .
" Venus and Mars , " says Senior Res@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ cher of the P@@ .@@ K. Sh@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ berg State Astron@@ omy Institute ( GA@@ IS@@ h ) Vladimir Sur@@ d@@ in .
But while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life , Venus has 500-@@ degree temperatures .
Life is possible only at a high alt@@ itude or on the orbit of Venus ... in space .
The question of reproduction in space began with fl@@ ora .
Half a century ago , experiments were run on plants .
Four gener@@ ations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earth counterparts .
Then , insec@@ ts were b@@ red in orbit , small fruit fli@@ es .
In 1979 , quail eggs were sent to space , to check how an embr@@ yo develops in weightlessness .
We get an absolutely normal c@@ h@@ ick .
But then the problem begins .
" The problem is related to the fact that this c@@ h@@ ick needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , " explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Bi@@ ological P@@ r@@ o@@ ble@@ ms ( IM@@ BP ) R@@ AN Vladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
Having found no support , c@@ h@@ icks were tum@@ bling around in disorder .
After 10 hours , the new@@ bor@@ ns experienced complete atro@@ phy of inst@@ incts .
Chic@@ ks did not react to light and sound .
And the problem was that they simply died after four days .
" We b@@ red c@@ h@@ icks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , " says Vladimir Sy@@ che@@ v , confir@@ ming the failure of the exper@@ iment with c@@ h@@ icks in space .
The last biological " mini-@@ a@@ r@@ k " with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago .
In spring 20@@ 13 , experiments will continue .
However , only same-sex beings will be on the B@@ ion bio@@ -@@ satellite .
There was an exper@@ iment with rats , who were sent to space with f@@ o@@ e@@ t@@ us .
In principle , there was nothing extraordinary there .
" This was on bio@@ -@@ satellites , but again , it was a s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ular exper@@ iment and such research needs to be conducted , " says Vladimir Sy@@ che@@ v .
After landing , the cosmic rats had babies .
But it 's hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space .
It 's not an easy task .
A@@ n@@ i@@ m@@ als simply cannot follow their sexual inst@@ inct , when they 're out of their familiar environment .
In principle , people , unlike animals , can .
Hom@@ o s@@ a@@ pi@@ ens have abstra@@ ct thinking , and are able to create a fit@@ ting emotional background .
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons .
But women have been flying to space for 50 years .
The biggest risk was for Ter@@ eshkova .
The most valuable thing for hum@@ a@@ n@@ ity is the female body .
Our " Se@@ a@@ g@@ ull " left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space .
Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight .
" Nobody answered this question , " says rocket and space industry veteran , V@@ a@@ k@@ ht@@ a@@ n@@ g V@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ a@@ d@@ ze .
In June 1964 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman in space Valent@@ ina Ter@@ eshkova gave birth to a daughter .
The child 's father , A@@ n@@ dri@@ an Nik@@ o@@ l@@ a@@ ev , was also a c@@ o@@ s@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ aut .
In 1988 , the second woman c@@ o@@ s@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ aut , S@@ vet@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ a Sav@@ i@@ t@@ s@@ k@@ a@@ y@@ a , who went into orbit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son .
However , the risk remains .
We have few , very few c@@ o@@ s@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ a@@ u@@ ts , who were OK and had healthy children after long flights .
" What 's more , it is dangerous even for orbital flights , " adds pilot and c@@ o@@ s@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ aut , Her@@ o of the U@@ S@@ S@@ R , Her@@ o of Russia , Val@@ ery Poli@@ a@@ k@@ ov .
And yet , hum@@ a@@ n@@ ity needs to seek out some new a@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ u@@ es in bio@@ technologies , protection from radi@@ ation , creation of artificial gravity .
Hy@@ dro@@ -@@ laboratory of CP@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight .
Here , c@@ o@@ s@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ a@@ u@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zero-@@ gravity conditions .
Water i@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ ates weightlessness .
If for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , for infants it is a native element .
Sm@@ all a@@ m@@ p@@ hi@@ bi@@ ans seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean .
There is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in a@@ m@@ n@@ io@@ tic flu@@ id in the wom@@ b ; it is easier to get used to water after that .
In principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first ba@@ thing .
" This is very little time to forget something , " says infant swimming instruc@@ tor Marina Ak@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ ova .
In other words , if for a newborn weightlessness is more natural , a woman needs gravity , earth 's pull .
S@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ ach and p@@ e@@ l@@ vic mus@@ cles usually quickly d@@ e@@ generate in weightlessness ; the ability to push out the embr@@ yo is reduced .
Well , let 's assume that chil@@ dbirth stim@@ u@@ l@@ ators will work out .
Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room .
" Then what ? " - asks Val@@ ery Poli@@ a@@ k@@ ov about this non-@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ al issue .
On the other hand , a baby also needs artificial gravity .
When a body does not feel the earth 's pull , it does not form the s@@ k@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ t@@ al and mus@@ cular system .
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training , as they do with adults .
He will simply not have what he needs to survive .
" And this exper@@ iment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a handic@@ apped , completely u@@ n@@ adapted human to earth , " predic@@ ts Chairman of the Committee on Bio@@ eth@@ ics IM@@ BP R@@ AN Igor P@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ov .
For the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory .
However , with time , it will become reality , when e@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their offspring , who were born in space .
N@@ K@@ U Head : S@@ var@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians .
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it lag@@ s behind in their application .
This was said by Mil@@ o@@ sla@@ v Kala , vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an interview for Ak@@ t@@ u@@ a@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ .@@ c@@ z .
" The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , " states Kala , comm@@ enting on the current situation .
Simil@@ ar conclu@@ sions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors .
As an example of improper practice , they cite Pet@@ r N@@ e@@ c@@ as 's approach to the so-called " S@@ var@@ c System . "
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ DS will not be b@@ u@@ r@@ dening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed ?
" The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohib@@ its something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ u@@ t@@ y-@@ bound to monitor and enforce , " asser@@ ts Kala .
At the audit committee 's session in the House of D@@ e@@ pu@@ ties , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared .
What exactly was this about ?
This is about parallel a@@ u@@ d@@ iting , which we began around two years ago .
Simp@@ ly put , this is about how European legislation g@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ s the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state leg@@ i@@ s@@ l@@ ations and then the actual practice itself .
We brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even " more conc@@ ise and complete , " however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany .
This confir@@ ms that creating more and more conc@@ ise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
What does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
This kind of joint audit could contribute to c@@ u@@ r@@ t@@ a@@ iling these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact .
Econom@@ y means acqu@@ iring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profite@@ ering and possible criminal proceedings may be avo@@ ided .
However , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be proc@@ ured .
The system might become over@@ loaded with the amount of paperwork , and those , who wish to look for l@@ o@@ o@@ p@@ holes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
These are domestic problems about the practical imple@@ ment@@ ation of legislation relating to public contracts .
How does the audit system work in Germany ?
Is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or is it organ@@ ised d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ently ?
As far as the office is concerned , the B@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ u@@ n@@ g@@ s@@ h@@ of fun@@ ctions like our N@@ K@@ U , and it is organ@@ ised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ently , but basically both offices operate similarly .
Powers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organ@@ ised f@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ally , so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ ers from our own .
The B@@ R@@ H can only audit federal money , known to us as state funds .
Public funds , which , for us , are administ@@ ered by regional and municipal authorities , are audited by the federal courts of auditors there .
When it comes to their legislation , is it more stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward than ours ?
Overall , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect .
Is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ?
That is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ ons .
It should be said that even in a country we p@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ eive as exempl@@ ary , they encounter a whole range of problems .
If that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
C@@ o@@ m@@ ing back to domestic legislation , what did the amend@@ ment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ?
The period since the amend@@ ment came into force has been quite short , so it has not manifest@@ ed itself in our audit work yet .
Since we carry out our a@@ u@@ dits ex-@@ post , a certain delay has to be taken into account .
As yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future a@@ u@@ dits - we have launched our new " fiscal failure risk d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ction " system , with which we have proc@@ essed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analy@@ sed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed .
A problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes " too constrained " and will not be e@@ n@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ ce@@ able .
Under the previous rules , parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infrin@@ gement of public contracts law means a breach of bud@@ get@@ ary discipline .
Is it worth c@@ o@@ n@@ stra@@ ining the law in this way , in that case ?
I do not think this is the way .
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not pen@@ alise those , who make a mistake on a techn@@ i@@ c@@ ality , which does not affect the final decision .
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bure@@ a@@ u@@ cra@@ cy .
So how can we get out of this ?
Let 's see where this dead@@ -@@ end takes us .
The Prime Minister recently said the O@@ DS will not be b@@ u@@ r@@ dening businessmen with a@@ u@@ dits of the so-called " S@@ var@@ c System " - what does this mean ?
Is the S@@ var@@ c System prohib@@ ited or allowed ?
The Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohib@@ its something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ u@@ t@@ y-@@ bound to monitor and enforce .
He may say : " Let us change this law and rela@@ x it , " but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there .
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ alities which must be adher@@ ed to - which is the right way to ensure public t@@ e@@ n@@ ders are protected .
On the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bidder with the best offer is excluded on a techn@@ i@@ c@@ ality .
The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
R@@ o@@ ads are icy in places , but mostly p@@ a@@ s@@ sable .
In several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are icy and snow@@ y .
However , the majority of roads are p@@ a@@ s@@ sable , with extra care needed in places .
Car@@ ls@@ bad region
In the Car@@ ls@@ bad region , the roads have been usable this morning , though in some places they were icy and snow@@ y .
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day .
Sno@@ wing in the region has stopped , and only a thin layer of snow remains in the l@@ o@@ w@@ lands .
However , the ridges of the Kr@@ u@@ s@@ ne Mountains have around 30 c@@ e@@ n@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ res of snow .
In some locations there is limited visibility due to m@@ ist , according to the local highway service .
The R@@ 6 high-@@ speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now usable without restri@@ ction .
Cau@@ tion is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain brid@@ ges , where the surface can be icy and sli@@ pper@@ y .
All second@@ ary and t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ary roads are also p@@ a@@ s@@ sable , including mountain roads .
In certain stretches of these roads there might be remaining fro@@ zen and c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ acted snow patches .
Above all , at higher levels , extra care should be taken while driving .
P@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ u@@ b@@ ice and H@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ c Kr@@ alo@@ ve region
On some roads in Eastern Boh@@ e@@ m@@ ia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher alt@@ itu@@ des and in the mountains there might be a layer of c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ acted snow , according to the Road and Motor@@ way Direc@@ tor@@ ate .
The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher alt@@ itu@@ des of the P@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ u@@ b@@ ice region in particular .
Black ice may occur around Lan@@ s@@ k@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ n , U@@ sti n@@ ad Or@@ lic@@ i , Poli@@ cky , S@@ vit@@ avy , and V@@ y@@ s@@ o@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on second@@ ary and t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ary roads .
The I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ avy .
Snow is particularly affecting the roads in the Kr@@ k@@ o@@ n@@ ose and Or@@ l@@ i@@ cke mountains .
At higher alt@@ itu@@ des , there is a c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ acted snow layer on the roads around Ry@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ o@@ v n@@ ad Kne@@ z@@ n@@ o@@ u and Tr@@ u@@ t@@ n@@ o@@ v .
In Eastern Boh@@ e@@ m@@ ia the day will be mostly clear to partly clou@@ dy , and dry .
Tem@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ atures will be between minus three and plus one degree Celsius mostly , with a light wind .
P@@ i@@ l@@ sen region
The roads in the P@@ i@@ l@@ sen region have been usable this morning , with extra care needed in some places . Drivers should take the weather conditions into account .
The morning will be fro@@ sty , with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero .
Due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature , certain roads may be icy .
Drivers should expect m@@ ist in places , though visibility will gradually improve .
This information was reported by the region 's highway service .
The D@@ 5 motorway is dri@@ vable almost without restri@@ ction , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80@@ th and 13@@ 1st kilometre marks .
Most primary road surfaces are dry and fro@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ free .
Southern areas of the P@@ i@@ l@@ sen and T@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ ov regions may have icy patches .
Se@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ d@@ ary and t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ary roads are wet , and may therefore also have icy patches .
Drivers should be cautious especially on less frequ@@ ented roads in the Boh@@ e@@ m@@ ian Forest .
Ol@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ c region
Drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Ol@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ c region .
It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ ven@@ o@@ h@@ o@@ r@@ k@@ se sed@@ l@@ o and on the way to Vid@@ e@@ l@@ sky Kri@@ z .
Sno@@ w@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ u@@ ghs were brought out by falling snow overnight , the Sum@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ k region , according to highway maintenance , got around three c@@ e@@ n@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ res of snow .
In other parts of the region , roads are mainly p@@ a@@ s@@ sable without restrictions .
" In the Sum@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ k region , traces of snow have remained at the highest alt@@ itu@@ des .
Drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush at Cer@@ ven@@ o@@ h@@ o@@ r@@ s@@ ke sed@@ l@@ o in the direction of J@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ ik , " the dispatch officer for the Sum@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ k highway service told CT@@ K today .
Their J@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ ik counterparts also made an outing overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest alt@@ itu@@ des are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment , according to them .
The Ol@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ c region 's roads are usable without restri@@ ction , while in the area of S@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ k drivers should b@@ e@@ w@@ are in woo@@ ded areas , where roads have remained wet .
U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ b@@ e@@ m region , Liber@@ e@@ c region
Since this morning , the snow@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ u@@ ghs have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern Boh@@ e@@ m@@ ia .
Besides certain sno@@ w@@ -@@ covered places , or some icy fro@@ st patches , the mountain road from Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ i@@ n@@ ice in the U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ b@@ e@@ m region is also closed , according to the police database .
Tem@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ atures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snow@@ y and icy . In the l@@ o@@ w@@ lands , however , particularly southeast of the Central Boh@@ e@@ m@@ ian U@@ p@@ l@@ ands , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry .
No traffic hol@@ d-@@ up@@ s have so far been reported .
I@@ cy fro@@ st patches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Ste@@ ti .
According to meteor@@ ologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day , with a clear night and fre@@ ez@@ ing temperatures .
Ad@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ se conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ sti n@@ ad La@@ b@@ e@@ m and Liber@@ e@@ c regions .
The closure of the Tel@@ nice to Kn@@ i@@ n@@ ice road was caused by bent tree bran@@ ches , which were weighed down to road level by snow@@ fall .
Simon Or@@ n@@ est : At the conc@@ erts we want a f@@ u@@ sion of positive energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ?
It is just another s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ ler , which we like to lat@@ ch on to .
Together with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , we tend to jo@@ ke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or aver@@ t the end of the world completely .
In December you are even organis@@ ing a unique series of three conc@@ erts against the end of the world .
Can you give our readers some details on this ?
This is a nationwide fund@@ -@@ raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years .
We decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the May@@ an calendar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.m .
On the eve , the 20th of December , at 9pm , 3 conc@@ erts will take place in parallel in Pra@@ gue , Br@@ no , and O@@ stra@@ va .
They will end at around the time when Ki@@ r@@ i@@ bat@@ i Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the May@@ an calendar .
Who came up with this idea ?
Initi@@ ally it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our designer , Hon@@ za A@@ u@@ g@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ a .
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thou@@ ghts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
On the occasion of the end of the May@@ an calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , shoes , t-@@ shirts , bags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at www.@@ e@@ -@@ tap@@ .@@ c@@ z to support our cause .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band , together with other artists , also recorded the so-called a@@ n@@ them against the end of the world , called " The End of the World is canc@@ elled . "
It is already well received on YouTube , will it figure at the fund@@ -@@ raising conc@@ erts ?
Of course , for the grand finale , as long as the world does not end beforehand .
It will be sung by all the artists at all the three conc@@ erts at the same time .
The a@@ n@@ them will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television .
The words were written and the role of J@@ e@@ s@@ us in the video cli@@ p was played by Tom@@ as Han@@ ak , X@@ ind@@ l X also s@@ ings in it ...
How did you end up working with them ?
We collaborate also with other person@@ alities of the Czech cultural scene , due to organis@@ ing a lot of fund@@ -@@ raising events and conc@@ erts ...
We try to really get them involved in these projects .
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us .
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to ?
Equ@@ i@@ pping the wheel@@ c@@ h@@ air@@ -@@ accessible educational Stu@@ deo centre , which is already in its sixth year , in collaboration with the citizens association Ta@@ p from the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ a Institute for the disa@@ b@@ l@@ ed .
T@@ u@@ t@@ ors come in regularly to spend time with the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ a Institute 's students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them .
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors , so we try to provide this for them in this way .
Within the construction project at the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ a Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project .
Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists .
How do you select them ?
We have tried to compile a programme , which speaks for all ages , including children .
For example , in Pra@@ gue , Chin@@ a@@ s@@ ki , Sup@@ port Les@@ bi@@ ens , Illu@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ a@@ t@@ o@@ sphere with Dan Bar@@ ta , The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p , M@@ a@@ r@@ ian B@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ o and J@@ iri Su@@ c@@ h@@ y will appear .
Further details can be found at www.@@ k@@ p@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ c@@ z .
Are you planning any more " b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ ic events " in the future ?
In May , we will be making our first appearance in the Pra@@ gue Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good line-up with some interesting guests .
Next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago .
Your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is nonetheless a band composed of handic@@ apped people .
How do you cope with these jour@@ neys in terms of logist@@ ics and organisation ?
It is not as scary as it might seem at first .
We have five members in electric wheelchairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ m@@ ent cases ...
Nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , CS@@ A and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised .
Even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went sm@@ o@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ ly .
Thanks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to compare specific accessi@@ bility issues , public attitudes to disa@@ bility and so on .
What have been your experiences so far ?
After Madrid , Luxem@@ bourg , London and other places , where everything fun@@ ctions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beg@@ innings .
C@@ o@@ m@@ pared to Pra@@ gue , Moscow is rather i@@ n@@ accessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be trav@@ elling around the city centre on his or her own .
Ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous things , such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts , are not c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ place there .
Fort@@ u@@ n@@ ately , citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
And on the other hand , where do we still l@@ a@@ g behind more advanced countries ?
There are a lot of things , which we still l@@ a@@ g behind on ...
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always dep@@ end on the efforts of the people who are affected .
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious han@@ d@@ i@@ caps to be independ@@ ently out in public , and they can use the toilets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p we are a step ahead !
Public respect or accessi@@ bility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athletes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
So far there are only exc@@ e@@ p@@ tional cases , people who are strong-willed .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what prompted you in 1998 to form it ?
I began my job as a tut@@ or at the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ a Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
Since I am a musician myself - among others I play the s@@ a@@ x@@ o@@ p@@ h@@ one - I started a music club with a colleague .
With time , as our moder@@ ator Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovic says , it has grown a little out of our control ( laugh ) .
Your popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mist@@ aken ?
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band .
We real@@ ised that work , which goes on u@@ n@@ seen can be like it never exist@@ ed .
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tutors , equipment and so on .
Was it your goal to take The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p to such heights ?
From the out@@ set , I felt there was potential to do things a little d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ently .
Show business is filled with things , where one i@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ ates the other .
It is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in hes@@ i@@ t@@ antly and take a long time .
Things , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would d@@ are to claim that Ta@@ p Ta@@ p is one of those things .
A person 's first impression on seeing you is , of course , p@@ ity - it is a natural reaction ...
But that p@@ ity is simply w@@ asted , because handic@@ apped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be p@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ ed .
They are people , who can fully live life and b@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ m , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
I say that when a person with a handic@@ ap succe@@ eds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are suggesting ?
If we want to achieve top class work , we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
I think this is to be expected .
Some people come to us with a roman@@ tic idea and their head in the clouds , and when they find out they have to go to r@@ e@@ hear@@ s@@ als twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time trav@@ elling to conc@@ erts , their enthusiasm quickly disappe@@ ars .
That is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .
The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p band currently has twenty members .
How many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?
Only one , Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovic .
We are an open group , people come and people go , this is u@@ n@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able .
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open .
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9pm .
The venues will be Pra@@ ha I@@ n@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ b@@ a , Br@@ no F@@ l@@ e@@ da , and O@@ stra@@ va Pl@@ y@@ n@@ o@@ j@@ em with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic .
All three cities will be joined by a televised l@@ i@@ n@@ k-@@ up at the evening 's close for a united rendition of The Ta@@ p Ta@@ p 's a@@ n@@ them " The End of the World is canc@@ elled "
The concert 's goal is to raise funds to equip the ST@@ U@@ DE@@ O multi-@@ functional whe@@ el-@@ chair accessible learning centre at the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ a Institute in Pra@@ gue in the sum of 25 million Czech crow@@ ns .
Ad@@ mission fee to the concert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K , children under 12 years of age go free , tickets on sale from Boh@@ e@@ m@@ i@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ cket .
Poland and the C@@ o@@ smo@@ s .
Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the t@@ w@@ enti@@ eth member of the agency , being the second nation from the former Eastern Block ( after the Czech Republic , which became a fully fle@@ dged member of the E@@ SA on the 12th of November 2008 ) .
Poland began close cooperation with the E@@ SA in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects .
Of course , Poland 's path to the space had begun much earlier .
Pol@@ ish b@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding .
I look back , for instance , to the lec@@ ture of A S@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ feld in Warsaw 's astron@@ omy observ@@ atory , who , on the 6th of December 1@@ 9@@ 33 , presented ideas on his pion@@ e@@ ering work E@@ n@@ try into space .
The thou@@ ghts of the young engineer ( born 1@@ 9@@ 05 ) left his audience cold , and years later S@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ feld remember@@ ed that only Dr. J@@ an G@@ a@@ d@@ omski had shown an interest in his work .
In 1934 , for his work E@@ n@@ try into space , S@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ feld received the Robert E@@ sn@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t-@@ Pel@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ie and Andre Louis Hirsch prize in France .
The above mentioned Dr. J@@ an G@@ a@@ d@@ omski ( 18@@ 99 - 1966 ) later became a strong promo@@ ter of astron@@ omy and astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics .
He published hundreds of articles in Pol@@ ish journals , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects .
G@@ a@@ d@@ omski became a world-@@ known promo@@ ter of astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recogn@@ ised when a crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him .
In 1925 , Poland had already built a hand@@ car which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine .
Unfortunately , both the project 's designer , and the project 's details , are unknown .
It is not even clear , whether the rocket was intended to start the hand@@ car or to slow it down .
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time .
In 1@@ 9@@ 33 the Pol@@ ish artillery started their engagement in flying bombs .
The research was undertaken by the We@@ a@@ p@@ ons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof@@ . M@@ i@@ e@@ c@@ z@@ ys@@ law Wol@@ f@@ ke and Prof@@ . Gu@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ w M@@ o@@ k@@ r@@ z@@ y@@ c@@ k@@ i .
From the documents , it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests .
Of course , the advance of the German army interrup@@ ted the research .
In 1937 , the concept of a photo@@ electric hom@@ ing rocket designed by engineer R@@ o@@ h@@ o@@ zin@@ ski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Rock@@ et - air tor@@ ped@@ o and flying rocket-@@ bomb appeared , authored by L@@ e@@ l@@ iw@@ y-@@ Kr@@ y@@ wob@@ lock@@ i .
Both projects were d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ined for military use of rocket engines .
Im@@ medi@@ ately prior to the War , all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the P@@ r@@ o@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ onal Scienti@@ fic Advis@@ ory Board ( Ty@@ m@@ c@@ z@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ w@@ y K@@ o@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ et Dor@@ a@@ d@@ c@@ zo@@ -@@ N@@ a@@ u@@ kow@@ y ) that coordinated all the work .
The Board was appointed in 1937 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War .
Further work devoted to astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics appeared in the Pol@@ ish Press after the War thanks to the Pol@@ ish Astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ s@@ k@@ ie T@@ o@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ z@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ w@@ o Astron@@ a@@ u@@ ty@@ c@@ z@@ ne ) .
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine P@@ r@@ o@@ ble@@ ms in 1954 , in which four in-@@ depth articles are on the subject of astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics .
In one of these , by Prof@@ . Su@@ b@@ o@@ tow@@ icz , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedic@@ ate itself to astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics .
At the time , there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that cosmic research was an emerging sector .
From the beginning of 1@@ 9@@ 56 , the Pol@@ ish Astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics Company ( PT@@ A ) sought entry to the International Astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics Federation ( est . 1951 ) and by autum@@ n the PT@@ A was already a full member .
In the following year , the PT@@ A 's first chairman , K@@ az@@ i@@ m@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ z Z@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ k@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ icz ( 1@@ 9@@ 02 - 1959 ) was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International Astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics Federation .
He served in this capacity until his death in 1959 .
From 1@@ 9@@ 56 , the PT@@ A played a significant role in the successful development of meteor@@ ological rock@@ ets R@@ M ( R@@ a@@ k@@ i@@ e@@ ta M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ o@@ r@@ olog@@ i@@ c@@ z@@ na ) , which became the first Pol@@ ish rocket to enable scientific research .
The first R@@ M-@@ 1 model was completed in 1@@ 9@@ 57 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958 .
The rocket , with a ceiling of 18@@ 00 metres , measured around 80 cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg .
Later , the improved R@@ M-@@ 1@@ A version was construc@@ ted and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initi@@ ated for the two-@@ stage R@@ M-@@ 2 rocket in the Ble@@ dow@@ sky Des@@ ert .
The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.@@ 5 kg .
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the R@@ M-@@ 34 rocket was to reach 14.@@ 5 km and be tasked with monitoring high alt@@ itude winds .
Of course , in 1962 further research was stopped .
The successor to the R@@ M rocket type was the M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ or-@@ 1 rocket , developed from 1962 to 1965 .
The rocket was designed as a two-@@ stage rocket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg .
Three models were developed ( designated M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ or-@@ 1@@ A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ ered in the room available for scientific apparatus .
In the M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ or-@@ 1@@ A rocket , a space of 0.4 lit@@ res was available , M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ or-@@ 1@@ B had 0.34 lit@@ res , and M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ or-@@ 1@@ C had 0@@ .@@ 62 lit@@ res .
The maximum alt@@ itude for all three models was 37@@ km .
Between 1965 and 1968 , the development of M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ or-@@ 2 was underway in the Aer@@ onautics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 .
The M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ or-@@ 2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60@@ km .
Sub@@ sequ@@ ently built models were the M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ or-@@ 2@@ H and M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ or-@@ 3 .
Poland 's admission to CO@@ S@@ P@@ A@@ R ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1@@ 9@@ 60 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ S@@ P@@ A@@ R board two years later .
Poland also participated in the I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ k@@ o@@ smo@@ s space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites , and in 1@@ 9@@ 78 , the Pol@@ ish pilot Mi@@ r@@ o@@ s@@ law Her@@ mas@@ ze@@ wski became the second i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ o@@ s@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ aut after Vladimir Rem@@ k@@ o@@ v .
A@@ b@@ o@@ l@@ ishing the legislation on public works is not the solution .
Last week the Const@@ itu@@ tional Court abolished the law on public works .
The resolution caused lively public debate .
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective .
Liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU , just as those in the glob@@ alised world , are based on the principle of an u@@ n@@ regulated economic competition .
Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
The cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely u@@ n@@ regulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation .
Due to significant lab@@ our cost differences ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices .
On this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by impor@@ ting cheap goods , " the rug is pulled " from under the competition 's prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
On a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import cheaply from abroad , or close down . The result is high unemployment in countries where lab@@ our costs are high compared to other economies .
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
The whole situation is bol@@ stered by the business@@ man 's complete u@@ n@@ willingness to pay taxes , which would alle@@ v@@ i@@ ate the econom@@ ical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statist@@ ical data .
The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mut@@ ual competition , aiming to arti@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ally lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
In other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while dis@@ regarding the drop in social standards .
This occurs chie@@ fly in amend@@ ments to existing law .
The aim is to econom@@ ically force the domestic population to accept prices dict@@ ated by private capital , especially in terms of salaries .
On one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long-term unemployment , on the other , restri@@ cted employee rights in the work@@ place .
This yields growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich .
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-@@ out cent@@ res for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
The number of these people is already in the millions .
In the name of impro@@ ving the compet@@ itiveness of the German economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of a@@ u@@ x@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ary staff in the Bun@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ g .
The a@@ u@@ ster@@ ity measures for all the southern EU states will u@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ u@@ b@@ tedly lead to the same situation , where people are pressured by a cat@@ astro@@ phic drop in living standards to e@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ rate as it was in the 19th century , or to eke out an existence on starvation wages on the edge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment .
At this point we have to ask where this may come from ?
If it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shifted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Braz@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ an , Turkish , Mor@@ oc@@ can , Egyptian , and African lab@@ our is still at a fraction of European wages .
This applies to all of Latin America .
Liberal theory and the Media i@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic r@@ u@@ in .
Private capital cru@@ elly insists on the vie@@ w@@ point that the State must not interven@@ e in the economy .
Ther@@ e@@ u@@ p@@ on , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own selfish ends .
Here , the answer must be yes .
The proof is the existence of the almost o@@ m@@ ni@@ potent , and in all states , o@@ m@@ ni@@ present lobby .
The result is a desperate situation manifest@@ ing itself through corruption , through mut@@ ual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is pun@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ a@@ b@@ le .
In Germany the situation is such that state m@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the dra@@ f@@ ting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry .
These laws are then approved in the Bun@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ g .
Real power does not come from the people as the West@@ ern-@@ style constitu@@ tions claim , but from strong financial organis@@ ations that look after their own interests .
It is clear that liber@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ y-@@ ori@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ated democra@@ cies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by App@@ ian in his work on the Roman Republic Cris@@ is in the time of Cesar and Pom@@ p@@ e@@ i : " The State was already long in complete d@@ e@@ generation and its offices taken by force .
With bri@@ bery , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with stones or swords .
Bri@@ bery and corruption were r@@ i@@ fe and u@@ n@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ dered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought " ... " people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole deb@@ a@@ c@@ le meant the state went eight months without consul@@ s .. " .. " There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ cra@@ cy , and an ener@@ g@@ e@@ tic man should be elected . " App@@ ian had Pom@@ p@@ e@@ i in mind , but it was Cesar who changed democracy for auto@@ cra@@ cy perman@@ ently .
The conclusion , just as in anti@@ quity , the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole .
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
The outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented dec@@ a@@ d@@ ence of the elite with no attempts w@@ h@@ a@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever on deeper reaching reforms .
The c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ality of the rise of the fas@@ c@@ ist and communist reg@@ imes should therefore be sought in the misguided liber@@ a@@ l@@ isation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries .
The current state of affairs , when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liber@@ alised democracy as an i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ l@@ u@@ de , can expect its next cycle .
The particularly cat@@ astro@@ phic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already wit@@ n@@ essing , as well as crimes against hum@@ a@@ n@@ ity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
The a@@ b@@ olition of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term .
Under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population 's living standards .
This pattern is thus s@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ emic .
To address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state 's capital participation in the economy , increase the people 's influence over the state and weak@@ en the monopol@@ y held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
Israel : Cha@@ os L@@ ab .
" Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could , " from S@@ t@@ ing 's Fra@@ g@@ ile , where one of the main v@@ e@@ r@@ ses from the refra@@ in is " L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . "
" If my sons did not want war , there would be none , " said the dying G@@ u@@ t@@ le Schn@@ a@@ p@@ per , wife of May@@ er Am@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ el Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ d in 18@@ 49 .
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip , as always , has spark@@ ed a lot of reaction .
Some stand by Israel , arguing it has the right to self-@@ defence , and Palestinians are portra@@ yed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claiming rac@@ ism by the Israeli state , claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs , and that Israel is a terrorist state .
I do not want to dwell , in these repeated perio@@ dic waves of killing , on who is the trans@@ gres@@ sor and who is the victim , after all , today 's i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants of Israel , including the self-@@ governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence .
I would like to offer the readers a peek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 95-@@ year long tension is serving ( starting from Bal@@ four 's declaration in November 1917 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East .
Some of my thou@@ ghts are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
Human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power .
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Nap@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ on .
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independ@@ ently , or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-@@ calculated goal .
We must accept that we live in a time when the world 's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentr@@ ation of wealth and the power it exu@@ des could not happen in one generation 's lif@@ esp@@ an .
Among these astron@@ o@@ m@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the puppet master ( whether someone else stands above them , I am unsure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ ds .
Not much is written about them .
Under@@ stand@@ ably .
The first news agency ( Reuters ) they bought in the 90 's of the 19th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high cri@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ ality , which appeared in their background and which always meant secur@@ ing power , increasing wealth , or both .
They hold majority s@@ t@@ akes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either w@@ aging or preparing for war ( before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the over@@ throw of K@@ a@@ d@@ d@@ a@@ f@@ i 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) .
Whoever attempted to def@@ y this family died .
Abraham Linc@@ oln refused to rene@@ w the status of the central bank to the Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ d Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state-@@ issued ) money and was assass@@ inated in 18@@ 65 at the theatre .
JFK began issu@@ ing his own money and wanted to close the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 1963 , Congres@@ sman Louis Mc@@ Fad@@ den was pois@@ oned in 1936 , after he had intended to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1@@ 9@@ 29 .
Their thir@@ st for global power led in the years of 18@@ 59 - 18@@ 71 to the f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ ulation of a three-@@ world-@@ war plan by the fre@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ s@@ on leader of the 3@@ 3rd degree , Albert Pi@@ ke .
The first war was to remove the large m@@ o@@ n@@ arch@@ ic state bodies in Europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world 's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of sla@@ ves will suff@@ ice for their comfort and luxury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( e@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ ism is just an app@@ e@@ t@@ iser for this solution ) , and finally the sei@@ zing of absolute power .
The method , which the group of wealthy families with the Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ ds leading the way , emplo@@ y is the inst@@ igation of cris@@ es , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab c@@ h@@ ao - order from c@@ h@@ a@@ os ) .
These solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( v@@ i@@ de establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated ) .
Thus , having succeeded in assass@@ i@@ n@@ ating Ferdinand , the Hab@@ sburg heir to the A@@ u@@ stro@@ -H@@ u@@ n@@ g@@ arian throne , in Sar@@ aj@@ evo thereby unle@@ ashing World War I , they destroyed t@@ s@@ a@@ r@@ ist Russia with the Bol@@ shevi@@ k revolution .
The First World War ended abrup@@ tly , milit@@ arily and econom@@ ically u@@ n@@ substanti@@ ated , with German cap@@ i@@ t@@ ulation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy t@@ s@@ a@@ r@@ ist Russia ) and the central European powers of A@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ a-@@ Hung@@ ary were sub@@ sequ@@ ently disman@@ tled .
To fac@@ ilitate the inception of the Second World War , they allowed bankers and politicians to create a lat@@ ent conflict situation by s@@ a@@ dd@@ ling Germany with huge war r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ ations , thereby making a r@@ a@@ dic@@ alist example of the impoverished m@@ asses , it remained only to intro@@ duce a sufficiently conv@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ ing cul@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ t and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi-@@ racial C@@ z@@ e@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ slo@@ v@@ a@@ k@@ ia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth colony , once the war had been ignited .
At the end of the 19th Century , the Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ ds inst@@ igated the establishment of the Zion@@ ist movement , one branch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic Ju@@ dea , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Return to Z@@ ion ) .
The a@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ mentioned Bal@@ four Dec@@ lar@@ ation formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population .
Terror@@ ist attacks occurred on both sides .
World War II broke out , and whether Hit@@ ler broke free from the l@@ e@@ ash , which international bankers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless the suffering of European Jews in the concentr@@ ation camps created the foundation to the world 's accep@@ tance of the Jewish State .
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ ations for World War II were l@@ a@@ yed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war 's hot@@ bed .
Provi@@ ded the international bankers succeed , the Jewish Nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the Arabic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of disc@@ ord and c@@ h@@ a@@ os not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Who is the wron@@ g-@@ d@@ o@@ er and who is the victim in the Pal@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ -@@ Israel conflict , where inj@@ ust@@ ice bre@@ eds inj@@ ust@@ ice in an end@@ less cycle of violence , while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power ?
Here , we must differenti@@ ate between Israel 's general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international bankers intro@@ duce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
Israel 's current prime minister , Net@@ any@@ a@@ h@@ u ' the hawk ' , is a typical example of a fas@@ c@@ ist politician , loyal to the international bankers , who does everything to inst@@ i@@ g@@ ate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the Hor@@ m@@ u@@ z Stra@@ it , where 20 % of the world 's oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world 's economy .
In what light stand the words , spoken by David Rockef@@ eller in 1994 : " All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . "
The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and sla@@ ve .
A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial arist@@ oc@@ rats .
A world , where each new@@ -@@ born is implanted with a chip , which makes their existence completely sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ated .
" He also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and sla@@ ve , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the b@@ e@@ ast or the number of his name .
If anyone has insight , let him calculate the number of the b@@ e@@ ast ,
for it is man 's number . His number is six hundred and six@@ ty six . "
A@@ r@@ go : When things are at their worst - call Hollywood .
In November 1979 , a mob of Islamic student demon@@ strators took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage .
They were to be released in exchange for the over@@ thrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pah@@ l@@ a@@ vi , who fled after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades .
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah over@@ board , because this would seriously je@@ o@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ i@@ se the trust of other allied countries .
The release of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the the@@ oc@@ r@@ atic regime , could not be achieved .
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States , which was later compounded by the fiasco of attempting to free the hostages by force .
The i@@ n@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ cer@@ ated diplomats were finally released after 444 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the A@@ l@@ g@@ e@@ r@@ ian government .
Their ordeal provoked a wave of soli@@ d@@ a@@ r@@ ity and anti-@@ Iranian feelings at home .
The deb@@ a@@ c@@ le in Iran significantly influenced Jimmy Carter 's loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections .
The film A@@ r@@ go , directed by the actor Ben Aff@@ l@@ e@@ ck , r@@ e@@ counts one episode in this story , which brought America a small victory .
Just before the embassy was seized , six employees escaped .
After some perip@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ i@@ a , they ended up in the Canadian ambassador 's residence .
The CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an extravagant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew , who were s@@ u@@ r@@ ve@@ ying locations for a sci@@ -fi blockbuster .
A combination of g@@ e@@ n@@ res
The plan , conceived by " e@@ x@@ fil@@ t@@ r@@ ation " expert , Tony Men@@ dez , required the assistance of Hollywood .
For the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were organ@@ ised , and the fic@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ ous production company had a real office .
The details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of Tony Men@@ dez .
Aff@@ l@@ e@@ ck 's film is a pecu@@ liar mix of g@@ e@@ n@@ res .
On one hand , there is a real@@ istic incisive political thriller , and at the same time a " cap@@ er movie , " with small victories and double-@@ crossing - another example would be Ocean 's Eleven .
The mood altern@@ ates in the film - on one side , sharp doc@@ u@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ y-@@ style sequences in Tehran ( the title sequ@@ ence shows iconic photos from news of the time , relating to the same events portra@@ yed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
On the other hand , ligh@@ ter sections from Hollywood , laced with irony and a little exagger@@ ation .
Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits deb@@ ating the situation around meeting tables , in office corri@@ dors , over the phone ...
Ben Aff@@ l@@ e@@ ck has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style .
The d@@ e@@ r@@ ided actor has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments .
A@@ r@@ go is his third big-@@ screen movie , following his dark crime movie G@@ one Baby G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the thriller The Town ( 2010 ) .
It is also Aff@@ l@@ e@@ ck 's first picture , which does not take place in the director 's hometown of Boston .
The atmospheric feel in different locations is one of the character@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ics , which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards .
Aff@@ l@@ e@@ ck shows it in A@@ r@@ go , where Tehran is " featured " by Canada .
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequ@@ ence of the siege on the embassy is impres@@ sively luc@@ id , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come flooding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
A similar effect is achieved by Aff@@ l@@ e@@ ck and his team in the fic@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ ous scenes ( the f@@ ake staff at the Tehran b@@ az@@ a@@ ar ) .
Too much action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many n@@ ail@@ -@@ biting scenes for the film .
What little there is , is worked well , with some oc@@ c@@ asi@@ onal e@@ m@@ bell@@ ish@@ ments to reality - these do not all come off so e@@ l@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ tly ( the scene , where a l@@ o@@ o@@ m@@ ing crisis is averted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far-@@ fetched ) .
A@@ r@@ go 's weakness is its diver@@ gence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places .
Alan Ark@@ in and John Good@@ man play their roles as the Hollywood assi@@ s@@ t@@ ants with great charm ; their characters deser@@ ve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film .
Aff@@ l@@ e@@ ck 's film loses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be watched with reasonable interest , its production and retro@@ -@@ style are e@@ v@@ oc@@ ative of thr@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ers from the 70 's .
It does not really cap@@ tivate .
As a reminder of history 's particular ways and a testimony to how exagger@@ ated the views are on the all-@@ powerful all-@@ controlling secret services , this will do .
Rules for blowing up ballo@@ ons , for ban@@ anas and a cir@@ cus
The www.@@ ban@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ n@@ ip@@ o@@ p@@ lat@@ k@@ y.com server , which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announce a competition for " the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . "
" We were prompted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe 's largest companies , " Patri@@ k N@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ er , the poll 's organis@@ er , told Pra@@ vo .
Among the latest nominated a@@ b@@ s@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ ities , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premi@@ ums for men and women .
Until now , women were fav@@ oured in life insurance prices , because they constit@@ ute a lower risk for insurers .
" Other unbelievable ideas from the EU can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year .
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 20@@ 13 , " informed N@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ er .
Among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of bio@@ -@@ ingredients to fuel , which consequently h@@ a@@ r@@ ms the environment , the ban on reliable m@@ e@@ r@@ cury ther@@ m@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ ters just because they contain a relatively small quant@@ ity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chicken c@@ ages , which significantly raised egg prices this year .
The ban on the use of the term " s@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ able butter " and the withdrawal of classic light bul@@ bs from sale had previously come under criticism .
First rate ban@@ anas are to measure 14 c@@ e@@ n@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ res
The Union 's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states ' interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vetoed ) .
The lobby 's interests were , for example , that ban@@ anas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU , and were not to display and " anom@@ alous curvature . "
The European Commission defended itself , saying that it was only harmon@@ ising existing dis@@ join@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading .
Nor@@ ms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been sof@@ tened by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing direc@@ tives .
One possible p@@ r@@ i@@ ze-@@ winner in the poll may be the last year 's EU regulation according to which inf@@ lat@@ able ballo@@ ons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without parental super@@ vision .
Here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , ballo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child suff@@ oc@@ ation .
A similar restri@@ ction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blo@@ wers .
S@@ t@@ range ideas are conceived at home too
Fair@@ ly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Mac@@ edonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Gre@@ ece , and instead the acron@@ ym F@@ Y@@ RO@@ M ( Former Yu@@ goslav Republic of Mac@@ edonia ) should be used .
The Ban@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ n@@ ip@@ o@@ p@@ lat@@ k@@ y.com server in collaboration with the Liberal Econom@@ ist Association , La@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ z F@@ aire , also nominated , aside from the a@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ mentioned a@@ b@@ s@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ ities , for example the Union 's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state .
The EU s@@ t@@ ip@@ u@@ l@@ ated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
The Czech Republic there@@ after exce@@ eded , for instance , the permitted volume of mus@@ h@@ room preserves , which incur@@ red a high penalty .
The poll 's organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coast@@ line , or the suggestion of a@@ l@@ locating funding for a request for funding .
These ideas did not come from Brussels , however , but from Pra@@ gue .
" We are handic@@ apped because we do not have the sea .
We are asking the European Union for a ref@@ und , " declared the minister for agriculture , back in autum@@ n 2004 , J@@ aro@@ sla@@ v Pal@@ as ( CS@@ S@@ D ) .
His argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals , and due to the so-called buy-@@ out interventions , the state 's w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses were full and were forced to export .
The Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to Pal@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euro@@ s .
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organis@@ ing a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea .
F@@ u@@ n@@ ding to subsidi@@ se funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development 's minister , Pav@@ el N@@ e@@ m@@ e@@ c ( US-@@ D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .
EU : B@@ i@@ z@@ a@@ r@@ re legislation is the exception
Reg@@ ulations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU 's efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union deser@@ ve recognition , according to a number of experts .
A more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with s@@ t@@ r@@ eng@@ t@@ h@@ ening the European integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting .
E@@ m@@ o@@ tions fl@@ are among C@@ z@@ e@@ c@@ h@@ s when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular lab@@ elling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
The C@@ z@@ e@@ c@@ h@@ s fought for six years with the Germans and A@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ ans to protect the lab@@ elling of their Ol@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ cke t@@ var@@ u@@ z@@ ky , however the t@@ u@@ z@@ e@@ m@@ sky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be r@@ e@@ n@@ amed t@@ u@@ z@@ e@@ m@@ ak by the manufacturers .
The app@@ ellation of rum can only be given to products dist@@ illed from can@@ e sugar , and not sugar b@@ e@@ et .
Car@@ ls@@ bad w@@ a@@ f@@ ers , P@@ o@@ h@@ o@@ reli@@ cky and Tre@@ bon@@ sky car@@ p , and Z@@ ate@@ c hop@@ s have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world-@@ renowned fet@@ a cheese and gor@@ g@@ o@@ n@@ z@@ ola , German mar@@ zi@@ p@@ an from Lu@@ b@@ e@@ ck , and Parma ham .
The EU 's stamp of protection can also be proudly shown on P@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ u@@ b@@ ice ginger@@ bre@@ ad and Hor@@ ick@@ y tubes .
People want me to save the republic , but I am an a@@ m@@ ate@@ ur , says Ok@@ a@@ m@@ ura
Senator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ?
This is not about me being a senator or president .
If everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post .
I cannot watch any longer the country having been rob@@ bed over the past twenty years , thie@@ ves r@@ o@@ aming about there and people 's taxes and retirement age increasing .
I had no ambition to be a politician .
When I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things .
Since I have already turned f@@ o@@ r@@ ty , and I am an independent non-@@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for senator or president .
You have already reached the Senate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle .
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Senate 's elections .
Later , I added that if I were elected as senator , I would be standing for president .
My goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be real@@ ised .
Ther@@ e@@ fore , I need the greatest influence , and the stron@@ gest mand@@ ate possible .
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pub or at the television , but that we tramp@@ le anyone , who wants to try to change things .
The Media add to this , misleading the public , and mist@@ aking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
For example , I was allegedly bri@@ bing reporters , or I was allegedly an advis@@ or of J@@ iri P@@ a@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ b@@ e@@ k .
Let 's talk about your vision .
You set out on your castle siege with a t@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ is on the material and criminal r@@ e@@ spon@@ s@@ i@@ bil@@ ities of politics , and a retro@@ active financial disclosure of assets over twenty million .
You need to change the law for this .
As president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws .
How are you going to solve this ?
When I lob@@ b@@ ied , as a citi@@ zen , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
The problem is political squ@@ a@@ b@@ bling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public .
As an independent non-@@ party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
The advantage I hold is that without the political pi@@ g@@ e@@ o@@ n@@ hol@@ ing or dog@@ m@@ as I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
Do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ?
From the Czech vie@@ w@@ point , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
For me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right .
The important part for me is moving forward .
It is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ S@@ C@@ M or the O@@ DS , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas .
You get angry when someone calls you a populist .
Are you not confir@@ ming this with what you have stated ?
When you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision .
You try to come close to it .
Some may call it p@@ o@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ism , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slo@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ s .
You will not last long in politics with that .
Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
I have no alternative .
I need to conv@@ ince politicians , reporters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
If I were elected president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil serv@@ ants , judges , and the Attorney General .
And , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this .
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
Take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure .
I will say frankly that I am an a@@ m@@ ate@@ ur , I am not a genius or an intellectual .
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision .
I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda .
I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
It sounds a little like Ok@@ a@@ m@@ ura is trying to save the Czech Republic .
I am no savi@@ our .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ tan@@ ces , whether they would run for the s@@ e@@ n@@ ate .
I went to Radi@@ m Jan@@ c@@ u@@ r@@ a , who declined due to his work@@ load .
So I , at least , support investig@@ ative journalist , Jan@@ a Lor@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ va , who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil .
I put myself forward , because people are really dis@@ cont@@ ented , but now I have my doub@@ ts .
Six@@ ty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment .
In the s@@ e@@ n@@ ate , there are only two independents , including me .
People have voted for a s@@ e@@ n@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes .
Non@@ etheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of may@@ ors or regional council presidents .
Are you considering having your own party ?
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to v@@ e@@ r@@ ify that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand .
You have no money ?
You are talking about financial disclosures , but what is y@@ o@@ urs like ?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million .
In Pra@@ gue , I have land worth around 25 million , an apartment worth ten million , another apartment worth eight million , an artwork collection worth around ten million , an A@@ s@@ t@@ on Martin worth 3.5 million , a Skoda Super@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account .
I have the A@@ s@@ t@@ on Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James Bond , who drove the car , was gall@@ ant with women and also fought against evi@@ l and v@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ y .
You drive an A@@ s@@ t@@ on Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ?
You say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
This does not insp@@ ire much confidence .
I do not have 15 million for a campaign .
Should I take out a loan ?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign .
The fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme .
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a senator .
However , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son 's English school , which costs 30 thousand a month .
If I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election .
So you will still be in business so that you can make a living ?
Did you not say you would be putting this on hold ?
This depends on the rate of pay .
As I promised , my activities have been parti@@ ally reduced .
For example , my deputy is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring .
People would like me to be a Sam@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ an , who saves the Republic .
But I must also live off something .
As a business@@ man , what would you usually make monthly ?
Two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do .
And if I became president , then I would end my business activity .
The full interview can be read in Saturday 's issue of Pra@@ vo .
The M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V archit@@ ects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ isse and the recently e@@ r@@ ected B@@ ü@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ berg ( lit@@ e@@ r@@ ally " book mountain " ) - 2 photos
" I think the building is fun , looks fut@@ u@@ r@@ istic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at , " said Lis@@ ette V@@ e@@ r@@ h@@ a@@ ig , a p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ -@@ by at the road@@ -@@ side .
And Ste@@ fan S@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ mon , IT techn@@ ician in a major firm based nearby commented : " It 's definitely a thing of beauty , the building . "
However , I do wonder why people would need another libr@@ ary in this day and age .
Everyone has the Internet , an i@@ Pad and e@@ Books .
N@@ o@@ -@@ one goes into one of these old-@@ style libr@@ aries volun@@ tar@@ ily n@@ o@@ w@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s , or am I wrong ?
S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , a sle@@ e@@ p@@ y town outside the gates of R@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ dam , which barely merits a visit , is a special record-@@ holder .
The 80,@@ 000-@@ resident mun@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality has the lowest lit@@ e@@ r@@ acy rate in the whole of the Netherlands .
In order to counter@@ act this a@@ s@@ i@@ n@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to r@@ e@@ c@@ reate the seven fic@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ ous brid@@ ges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete mini@@ atures .
The success of the education offensive was limited .
And so the city f@@ ath@@ ers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statist@@ ics : a libr@@ ary had to be built !
Win@@ y Ma@@ as of the R@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ -based architectural firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V , master of a@@ u@@ d@@ a@@ c@@ ious bar charts and producer of hum@@ o@@ r@@ ous and often cyn@@ ical buildings , took the project on with his customary compos@@ ure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a g@@ r@@ in on his face .
And with the jud@@ ging panel still looking at him with b@@ e@@ w@@ i@@ l@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ment , shr@@ u@@ gging their shoulders , the imper@@ tin@@ ent Ma@@ as stacked his chosen props by order of size to form a p@@ y@@ r@@ a@@ mid and rounded off his presentation - now s@@ u@@ itably backed up with action - with the words : " Dear Mun@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality ! "
So this is my suggestion for the S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ isse Book Moun@@ tain - for the so-called B@@ o@@ e@@ ken@@ berg !
Nine years later , the 30-@@ milli@@ on-@@ euro mountain has been lifted up .
It is part of a rev@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ isation project , which also includes an underground car park , a supermarket , a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and t@@ e@@ r@@ raced houses , with a total of 50 d@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ings .
At the beginning of November , the B@@ ü@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ berg was awarded second place in the " Best Li@@ b@@ r@@ ary of NL 2012 " competition .
In addition , the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 .
Thus , the fac@@ eless small-@@ town ret@@ ort , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-@@ modern pedestri@@ an area and a s@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ningly ugly town hall , behind whose white fac@@ ades one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bol@@ stered by a piece of contemporary architecture .
First and fore@@ most , however , S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ isse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence .
The long journey to the book
The first impression : the El@@ dor@@ ado of books beneath a cheese d@@ ome .
There is in fact a lift that clim@@ bs through the centre of the mountain massi@@ f , however , the true joys of space and literature are revealed when s@@ c@@ aling the top@@ ograph@@ y on foot .
The i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ior space , g@@ l@@ a@@ zed throughout , is bright and open , the fired clin@@ ker floors and the elegant street lamp@@ s speak the u@@ n@@ mist@@ a@@ k@@ able language of a public town square .
The urban a@@ m@@ bi@@ ance is perfect .
You are already on the l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ out for a park bench , a dog , and boys and girls playing football .
And everywhere there are books , books , books .
" Nor@@ m@@ ally book shelves run along the fac@@ ade , and in the centre there is a large , dark space , which is usually unpleas@@ ant and i@@ m@@ personal , " says Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
We turned the classi@@ cal s@@ p@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ al configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out .
The i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ior of the B@@ ü@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ berg is cle@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet libr@@ ary , a c@@ h@@ ess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room .
One particularly special feature are the black book shelves , which simultaneously act as wall cl@@ adding , p@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ ets and rail@@ ings for the stair@@ way .
The appearance , feel and s@@ c@@ ent are foreign .
Even die-@@ hard archit@@ ects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials .
" Here we wanted to work with r@@ e@@ c@@ ycl@@ able materials , " explained J@@ o@@ o@@ p Tro@@ u@@ b@@ o@@ r@@ st , Project Manager for the Mun@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality of S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ isse , on request of the Standard .
And thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a Fris@@ ian farm .
For many years , milli@@ met@@ re-@@ thick artificial f@@ abri@@ c has been used in green@@ houses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer .
It is inexpensive and saves time .
The thin text@@ ile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste .
For the libr@@ ary , the f@@ abri@@ c was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four-@@ c@@ e@@ n@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ re-@@ thick boards .
Under heat and pressure , the so-called Land@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ w plastic ( K@@ LP ) changes colour to a dark , hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ous and robust material , that sm@@ ells like a mixture of new car sm@@ ell and the sm@@ ell of trainers .
After 105 steps you have reached the summit .
At the end of the 500-@@ m@@ e@@ ter-@@ long journey , you are r@@ e@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ ded in the Liter@@ ature Café , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with Dutch c@@ r@@ o@@ q@@ u@@ e@@ t@@ tes and p@@ o@@ tted fic@@ us trees .
These provide atmosphere , but most i@@ m@@ port@@ antly , regulate the air humidity in the lit@@ e@@ r@@ ary mountain range .
Don@@ ations for the new sou@@ l
" You would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many glass panels , is a show@@ case project in the area of e@@ c@@ ology , " said Tro@@ u@@ b@@ o@@ r@@ st .
It is heated and cool@@ ed using g@@ e@@ o@@ thermal heat .
Although the B@@ ü@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ berg has a glass cover , the sun only s@@ h@@ ines only briefly into the i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ior , even on sunny days .
The broad , lam@@ inated wood glue beams position@@ ed at right-@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ les to the glass fac@@ ade , provide sha@@ de and absor@@ b the majority of the sunlight .
The indoor temperature is very pleas@@ ant .
The rest is taken care of by fully automatic rol@@ ler blin@@ ds .
Ste@@ fan S@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ mon , initially a s@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tic of the IT sector , has already vent@@ ured into the new libr@@ ary .
Lis@@ ette V@@ e@@ r@@ h@@ a@@ ig has also visited already .
So too has T@@ C@@ M-@@ teacher , Cyn@@ thia B@@ o@@ gar@@ de , who even refers to the B@@ o@@ e@@ ken@@ berg as S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ isse 's " long over@@ due sou@@ l . "
The reason : At the inaugur@@ ation just a few weeks ago , every citi@@ zen was invited to donate a book from his / her personal collection .
This was , for the time being , to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully sto@@ cked libr@@ ary - currently there are 70,000 items .
The concept has been a success .
The shelves are full to capacity .
" Nothing is worse than a half-@@ emp@@ ty libr@@ ary , " said archit@@ ect Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
" I think that , thanks to our invitation , every resident now has a certain bond with this new building .
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building .
Even if it 's just for decor@@ ation .
As such , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have succeeded in m@@ a@@ stering the master discipline that specialist j@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ on refers to as the formation of identity .
S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ isse has written lit@@ e@@ r@@ ary history .
However young and uneducated it may be .
This is ultimately a starting point for identity .
S@@ z@@ abo : " Germans must play a greater role "
In the vote on the incorpor@@ ation of Palestine , Germany a@@ b@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ed from voting .
According to Stephen S@@ z@@ abo , Exper@@ t in US-@@ European relations , in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
Deutsche Wel@@ le : At the beginning of the week , Germany had initially sign@@ alled that it would vote against the Palestinians ' application for o@@ b@@ server status within the United Nations .
However , Berlin sub@@ sequ@@ ently a@@ b@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ed from voting .
Why ?
Stephen S@@ z@@ abo : Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza .
Now , however , due to their special relationship with Israel , Germany must be cautious .
At the same time , however , I do not believe that it supports the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - a@@ l@@ b@@ e@@ i@@ t without being too critical of Israel .
During the up@@ rising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ wise a@@ b@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ed from voting , when it came to establishing a no-@@ fly zone .
This was ultimately implemented by NATO .
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs ?
Yes , it does .
That is because it has just r@@ e@@ organ@@ ised its foreign policy , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy .
This situation is aggrav@@ ated by the fact that the Euro@@ p@@ e@@ ans do not have a c@@ o@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ ent and stand@@ a@@ r@@ dis@@ ed policy .
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fron@@ ts .
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not accust@@ omed to .
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a " more normal " foreign policy .
A foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain .
So what specifically does a " normal " foreign policy e@@ n@@ t@@ ail , from a German perspective ?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or European partners .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Near East .
Germany 's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests .
Have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN ?
On the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East , and particularly in the Gulf States .
Ther@@ e@@ fore it must be careful not to a@@ f@@ f@@ ron@@ t the public , but also the elite in the Arabic countries .
In any case , this plays a role .
However , I wouldn 't want to a@@ s@@ cri@@ be too much weight to this . This is not an entirely one-@@ sided relationship .
Non@@ etheless , it does play an important role in Germany 's consider@@ ations .
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by a@@ b@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ing to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ?
I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position prev@@ ails .
Ther@@ e@@ fore I do not think that this was as dramatic a frac@@ ture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya .
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect .
After all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered .
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative .
The USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto .
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations ?
Due to the American domestic policy , these differences have always exist@@ ed .
I think that secretly , the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation .
However , due to the political situation here , the government is natur@@ ally unable to voice this position publicly .
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear .
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Net@@ a@@ n@@ j@@ a@@ h@@ u , Obama is really not quite so enth@@ used by Net@@ a@@ n@@ j@@ a@@ h@@ u 's policies .
Does Germany find it difficult to reconc@@ ile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other ?
I think that this is prec@@ isely what makes things so difficult for the Germans .
It would of course be a little sim@@ p@@ l@@ er for the Germans if there were a c@@ o@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ ent and stand@@ a@@ r@@ dis@@ ed European policy , which is currently not the case .
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
This is prec@@ isely what they are doing with the Euro .
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a stand@@ a@@ r@@ dis@@ ed European position .
This is , of course , no simple task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel .
This has always been a sensitive subject .
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role .
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult ?
Germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be uncomfortable and , for obvious reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
If we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany assum@@ es a more prominent role , various anti-@@ German feelings become apparent .
This does not make matters simple for the Germans .
This is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries .
From this stance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA .
It must be recep@@ tive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and this is not easy .
The influence of the USA over European politics is cont@@ i@@ n@@ u@@ ally dimin@@ ishing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacu@@ um , so who is filling the gap ?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
Even if they do not like it , even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c '@@ est la vie !

" Brand protection " in China : When P@@ u@@ m@@ a and A@@ r@@ mani suddenly become Chinese
A@@ r@@ mani is a world-@@ famous brand , Pol@@ o Ralph Lauren l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ wise .
However , what is A@@ r@@ mani Pol@@ o ?
Behind this name hi@@ des a fully officially registered brand in China , however , one that has nothing w@@ h@@ a@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever to do with the original companies .
Non@@ etheless , it is enjo@@ ying protection , provided the actual creators of the names do not sue .
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights .
" It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , " said Thomas Patt@@ loch , lawyer within the Taylor W@@ essing law firm , who speci@@ a@@ l@@ ises in copyright infrin@@ gement in the Far East .
Every week a new case lands on my desk .
All the c@@ o@@ p@@ y@@ cats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands .
Thus Gucci simply becomes Lu@@ -@@ Gucci , Pra@@ d@@ a@@ -K@@ ny is registered in place of Pra@@ da .
German companies are also ' leg@@ ally ' copied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting app@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ l , P@@ u@@ m@@ a .
Patt@@ loch opens a file containing regist@@ rations with the trademark office in Pe@@ king .
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copyrighted the brand name Z@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a D@@ F P@@ u@@ m@@ a there , an a@@ l@@ i@@ as that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer E@@ r@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ l@@ do Z@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a .
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in cop@@ ying and inf@@ ring@@ ing on intellectual property is well-known .
In the major cities there are multi-@@ level department stores that sell counter@@ f@@ e@@ i@@ t goods almost exclusively .
Patt@@ loch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere .
The Chinese call this " Bang M@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ pa@@ i , " a passenger brand .
The word is based on " Bang D@@ aku@@ an . "
This refers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men .
The Chinese authorities are u@@ n@@ aware of any wrong@@ doing .
" This h@@ a@@ r@@ ms business and we must fight against it , " challenges Patt@@ loch .
" The brand is watered down , its uni@@ q@@ u@@ eness disappe@@ ars - the image damage is enormous . "
The financial losses and process costs of the affected bran@@ ches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive flagship products .
According to information from market research company CL@@ SA , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , China is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fast@@ est growing .
However , the del@@ e@@ tion of d@@ u@@ b@@ ious entries in the trademark regist@@ ry are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty penny .
The process can last for up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .
Patt@@ loch reports of inst@@ ances wher@@ e@@ by the court dis@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ ses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the objec@@ tion is being raised has become a " market reality . "
If the complain@@ ant is unlucky , he may even have to pay the p@@ l@@ a@@ g@@ i@@ a@@ r@@ ist money for having inf@@ ring@@ ed on his trademark in China , said Patt@@ loch .
Sometimes the law of the jung@@ le prev@@ ails here .
Famous cases also rel@@ ate to graph@@ ic elements .
In 2009 , Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction mach@@ inery manufacturer S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer P@@ u@@ t@@ z@@ mei@@ ster .
Even today , the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an emble@@ m that r@@ e@@ sem@@ bles the Mercedes star .
Vol@@ v@@ o@@ -@@ purch@@ a@@ s@@ er G@@ e@@ ely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled the BMW logo ; the dispute was a@@ r@@ bit@@ rated and G@@ e@@ ely was forced to change it .
Fashion house Lac@@ o@@ ste lost a suit in China against c@@ o@@ p@@ y@@ cats from Hong Kong and Singapore , who were using the famous c@@ r@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ d@@ i@@ le looking in the other direction .
The Chinese authorities are u@@ n@@ aware of any wrong@@ doing .
The CT@@ M@@ O trademark office in Pe@@ king does acknowledge that there were bott@@ len@@ e@@ c@@ ks in 2010 due to limited s@@ t@@ a@@ ffing and equipment .
In the past year , however , things reportedly " returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . "
Thus the stock of u@@ n@@ proc@@ essed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent .
Almost 5@@ 7,000 such c@@ ased were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year .
Non@@ etheless , there are still 8@@ 1,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office .
To remedy this is very expensive
As is so often the case in China , the figures are imposing .
In the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CT@@ M@@ O , almost one third more than in 2010 .
This is a record and means that China , for the tent@@ h time in succession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority .
The same applies for the inventory of val@@ id trademarks , tot@@ alling 5.@@ 5 million in number .
In 2011 , 1.8 billion yuan in fees were received .
Put simply , this means that each application costs on average 1,2@@ 80 yuan , or 160 euros .
To appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Fre@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ berg .
For more than seven years , the group has been contesting against a Chinese p@@ l@@ a@@ g@@ i@@ a@@ r@@ ist .
The Germans did in fact manage to expose the company 's illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts .
However , the c@@ o@@ p@@ y@@ cat still secured the Chinese rights to the Fre@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ berg brand .
This is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be protected in Germany , said Hann@@ o W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Fre@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ berg C@@ h@@ e@@ m@@ ical Spec@@ i@@ a@@ l@@ ities in Mun@@ ich .
The CT@@ M@@ O trademark office then also dismissed the Mun@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ -based company 's appeal .
In the next two inst@@ ances , Fre@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ berg was proven right , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day .
You have to pay extremely careful attention .
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court .
W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and pra@@ ises the profession@@ alism of the courts .
However , he also says : " The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and ner@@ ves . "
The internal costs can barely be calculated , the company archive even had to look through cent@@ ury-@@ old records in order to provide proof .
Five years ago Fre@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ berg u@@ n@@ successfully offered the opposing party a " high six-@@ figure sum in euros " as settlement .
" This shows how much this is worth to us , " says W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler .
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to s@@ p@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ing over , back into Europe .
P@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ cul@@ arly if i@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ ators secure u@@ n@@ protected brand names there .
For example , a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Fre@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ berg label for shoes and l@@ e@@ a@@ ther in Germany .
This is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the regist@@ ration .
" You have to pay extremely careful attention , " says W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler .
Both he and Patt@@ loch adv@@ ise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China .
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register " everything " that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , " said W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler .
Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the regist@@ ration fee .
In actual fact : if Fre@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ berg were to loose at the final hur@@ dle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler .
Or altern@@ atively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector .
World AIDS day : S@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ p , sing , help
In Heidelberg , the Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ i choir is r@@ e@@ hear@@ sing - and in the Sw@@ az@@ i@@ l@@ and , AIDS orph@@ ans are del@@ igh@@ ted .
The history of a link that over@@ comes far more than a distance of 8,@@ 7@@ 33 kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res .
First of all , the stamp@@ ing : c@@ o@@ w@@ boy boots , basketball shoes , ladies ' pumps and men 's l@@ o@@ a@@ f@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the p@@ a@@ r@@ quet floor , and quickly do just that .
One-@@ two-@@ three-@@ four .
Only then do the voices of the s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers slowly s@@ well - a@@ l@@ to , b@@ ass , tenor and s@@ o@@ p@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ o surge , b@@ e@@ g@@ u@@ ile and h@@ a@@ unt .
And F@@ i@@ e@@ te Hop@@ f , the 29-year-old conduc@@ tor , almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the ensemble together with his smooth , yet wild gest@@ ures .
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psych@@ ology in Heidelberg the Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ i Choir are pra@@ c@@ t@@ ising a new song .
The fif@@ teen s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from human gene@@ tic@@ ists to the maintenance man .
" O@@ m '@@ O@@ ban@@ i " is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : Z@@ u@@ l@@ u , which is spoken by e@@ l@@ even million people in South Africa , Botswana , Les@@ oth@@ o , Mal@@ aw@@ i , Moz@@ a@@ m@@ bi@@ que and in parts of Sw@@ az@@ i@@ l@@ and .
Hel@@ ping others to help themselves
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world , as according to the e@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ ations of U@@ n@@ ai@@ ds , the United Nations ' programme to battle AIDS .
Of these , 23.@@ 5 million live in South Africa .
In Sw@@ az@@ i@@ l@@ and , there are 24@@ 5,000 AIDS orph@@ ans .
Meanwhile , more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive .
The Vo@@ ices for Africa Association has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orph@@ ans in the village of E@@ sit@@ j@@ e@@ n@@ i .
70 of these attend a second@@ ary school .
For 15 or 20 euros per month , you can become a sponsor .
This guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Go@@ go Centre .
In Z@@ u@@ l@@ u , Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ i means stor@@ y@@ teller or worshipper .
In this region , no-@@ one can speak the B@@ ant@@ u language flu@@ ently , but they can sing it .
For almost ten years the choir has been pra@@ c@@ t@@ ising songs in this foreign , ' soft ' language , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa .
For an 8,@@ 73@@ 3-@@ kilometre flight away from Heidelberg , in the north west of the Sw@@ az@@ i@@ l@@ and Kingdom , lies the village of E@@ sit@@ j@@ e@@ n@@ i , which relies on the vocal power of the German choir .
F@@ o@@ r@@ ty percent are infected .
Around 2,000 people live there , some still in simple mud and straw h@@ u@@ t@@ s , and the majority of them are children .
More than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they succumbed to the HIV virus .
In E@@ sit@@ j@@ e@@ n@@ i you get a small foresha@@ dow of the illness from which all of Sw@@ az@@ i@@ l@@ and is suffering : according to Unicef , the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world .
C@@ i@@ r@@ cum@@ c@@ ision , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half , is barely pra@@ c@@ t@@ ised by the population .
More than f@@ o@@ r@@ ty percent of people in the Sw@@ az@@ i@@ l@@ and carry the immun@@ o@@ def@@ iciency virus , and dying in you mid-@@ thir@@ ties is by no means rare .
On a group trip to Africa in early 2005 , the Choir visited the village , but first and fore@@ most , the Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ is saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in parental care but in practi@@ cally everything else as well : food , clothing , education .
Without a school leaving certi@@ ficate , there are barely any opportunities , particularly in a poor country .
Initi@@ ally it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year .
However , just one year later , the choir established the " Vo@@ ices for Africa " Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS orph@@ ans in E@@ sit@@ j@@ e@@ n@@ i at an almost professional level .

The Robert Koch Institute under@@ stands that at least four in five of all s@@ y@@ p@@ h@@ ilis cases reported in Germany are trans@@ mitted by means of sexual contact between men .
Among h@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ sexual adults , c@@ h@@ lam@@ ydia infections , t@@ r@@ i@@ chom@@ oni@@ asi@@ s , can@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ i@@ asi@@ s ( fung@@ al ) , g@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ h@@ o@@ ea and human pap@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ oma vir@@ uses are frequently occurring sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted diseases .
The spread of HIV among h@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ sexual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group .
Among young people , c@@ h@@ lam@@ ydia infections are much more common than in other population groups .
According to European surveys , three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
In this country , human pap@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ oma vir@@ uses are also frequently found in young people .
How has the number of infections developed ?
Not all sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted diseases are noti@@ f@@ i@@ able .
According to the Robert Koch Institute , the number of s@@ y@@ p@@ h@@ ilis infections has more than doubled from 1,69@@ 7 cases in 2001 , to 3@@ ,@@ 69@@ 8 cases in 2011 .
The number of newly contracted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 .
In 2011 there were around 2,700 cases .
This is around one tent@@ h fewer than the previous year .
Which symptoms indicate a sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted disease ?
The inf@@ ectious diseases can cause ulcers in the g@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ al area , dis@@ comfort when u@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ating , dischar@@ ge , lower abdomin@@ al pain and bli@@ sters or warts .
However , often they cause no pain or any other symptoms , thus remaining u@@ n@@ detected .
How can you protect yourself ?
C@@ o@@ n@@ dom@@ s can reduce the risk of contra@@ ction , however , they do not offer 100 % protection .
This is because occasionally , the path@@ o@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ s of sex@@ ually trans@@ mitted diseases can also be passed on via s@@ m@@ e@@ ar infections and close bodily contact .
Ther@@ e@@ fore , first and fore@@ most experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular exam@@ inations .
If diagno@@ sed early , the majority of ST@@ Is can be c@@ ured and long-term consequences avo@@ ided .
Through spon@@ sor@@ ships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .
" In total , we have already sent around 200,000 euros to E@@ sit@@ j@@ e@@ n@@ i , " said A@@ n@@ nette L@@ enn@@ a@@ r@@ tz , Cha@@ i@@ r@@ person of the association .
In the village itself , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini , a self-@@ assured and asser@@ tive woman , m@@ a@@ n@@ ages the money from Germany .
She makes sure that the orph@@ ans have good accommod@@ ation , for example with one of their g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mothers .
The Go@@ gos , as the old ladies are called in Z@@ u@@ l@@ u , are the p@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ars of the village .
Some of them have up to 14 orph@@ ans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes pun@@ ctu@@ ally every day , in their school uniforms .
Anyone who doesn 't have anyone left , arrives at the shelter with K@@ h@@ any@@ i@@ s@@ ile , a single woman who e@@ a@@ r@@ ns the same salary from the association as the two c@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ s who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day .
In addition , " Vo@@ ices for Africa " has established a sewing school , built two chicken c@@ o@@ ops and , together with the American health organisation , P@@ S@@ I , organ@@ ised for many in the village to be tested for HIV .
This is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead .
A king with 14 wives
" AIDS is an absolute tabo@@ o subject , " said A@@ n@@ nette L@@ enn@@ a@@ r@@ tz , " because it is associated with sexu@@ ality . "
This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives .
The last absolute monarch of sub@@ -S@@ a@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ an Africa , King M@@ s@@ wat@@ i III . , is known for his excessive lifestyle .
Poly@@ gam@@ y in place of democracy .
Among other factors , the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanc@@ tion@@ ed lifestyle .
Another factor is the large number of mig@@ rant workers who carry the virus across the country .
There are free condoms on every corner , said A@@ n@@ nette L@@ enn@@ a@@ r@@ tz , " but they are hardly used .
The culture prescri@@ bes otherwise - flesh to flesh . "
In order to promote the cultural exchange , the Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ i choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and s@@ ings songs of mel@@ anch@@ oly , fighting spirit , confidence and black self-@@ este@@ em , which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of a@@ p@@ arth@@ e@@ i@@ d .
A bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy , but some gri@@ m-@@ faced border soldiers even shed a few tears .
The journey always leads to E@@ sit@@ j@@ e@@ n@@ i , where the s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers visit their sponsor children .
Even though you can barely find the small village on a map , it is more than well-known in the valley of the E@@ z@@ u@@ l@@ w@@ e@@ n@@ i River .
" Go to E@@ sit@@ j@@ e@@ n@@ i , that 's where the light is , " say the people there .
And if you make the 8,@@ 73@@ 3-@@ kilometre flight back to Heidelberg , to visit the stom@@ ping s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers in their rehearsal room , you 'll see that the light is there too .
Messen@@ ger : NASA dis@@ covers ice on Mer@@ cury
The Messen@@ ger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cury .
It is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick .
The US space agency , NASA , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mer@@ cury .
Although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have fro@@ zen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine " Science . "
The Messen@@ ger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies perman@@ ently in sha@@ dow .
This is thought to be at east 30 c@@ e@@ n@@ tim@@ e@@ t@@ res and perhaps up to 20 metres thick .
The water presumably came from comets or perhaps also a@@ s@@ t@@ ero@@ ids that imp@@ acted with Mer@@ cury .
However , no-@@ one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet , said Chief Scientist for the Messen@@ ger probe , Sean Sol@@ omon .
The temperature on Mer@@ cury can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees Celsius .
That said , the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system .
U@@ n@@ known to the majority of the Earth 's i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants , there are probes , t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es and small robots such as the Phoenix , deployed to research the depths of the universe .

Our view of the universe : the most important t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es
The telescope is thought to have been invented in 16@@ 08 by Hans Li@@ pper@@ h@@ e@@ y - even before Gal@@ i@@ l@@ e@@ o Gal@@ i@@ l@@ ei used the device to o@@ b@@ serve the stars one year later .
Since then , the mirrors in optical t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound .
For a period of 30 years , nam@@ ely from 1@@ 9@@ 47 until 1975 , the Hale telescope in the Pal@@ o@@ m@@ ar Ob@@ serv@@ atory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world .
The mirror , shown in the image , had a diameter of five metres .
Arizona , USA , is home to the Large Bin@@ oc@@ ular Telescope .
It enables views of space via two mirrors , each with a diameter of 8.@@ 4 metres .
The inner work@@ ings of the Gr@@ an Tel@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ io Can@@ ari@@ as on the Can@@ arian island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres .
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is s@@ e@@ g@@ mented - to reduce costs .
In spite of this it achie@@ ves a diameter of around e@@ l@@ even metres .
The disa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ age of this inexpensive construction method : the telescope is sec@@ urely cl@@ amped at its angle of inclin@@ ation and its movement is therefore limited .
The H@@ o@@ b@@ by E@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ ly telescope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inclin@@ ation .
What sets it apart : the high ligh@@ t-@@ gathering capacity .
This - in spite of its c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ atively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world 's largest ref@@ lec@@ tor t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es .

This is home to the Very Large Telescope , which lives up to its name .
With its total of four mirrors , the telescope can also focus on the medial i@@ n@@ fra@@ red spectrum .
Lik@@ e@@ wise to be located at the E@@ S@@ O Ob@@ serv@@ atory in Chile , the European Extrem@@ ely Large Telescope is also being planned .
Its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements .
However , images are not to be expected until 20@@ 18 at the earliest .
Until 2007 , the two K@@ eck t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es at the Ha@@ wai@@ ian vol@@ can@@ o , Ma@@ u@@ n@@ a Ke@@ a , were the largest in the world .
They each have two mirrors , each with a diameter of ten meters .
The K@@ eck Tel@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es are part of the Ma@@ u@@ n@@ a Ke@@ a Ob@@ serv@@ atory , which alongside the K@@ eck t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es , can look to the heav@@ ens with the help of the Sub@@ a@@ r@@ u telescope and the IR@@ T@@ TF .
Another huge new telescope is also to be built on the Ma@@ u@@ n@@ a Ke@@ a , with a mirror diameter of thir@@ ty metres .
Here you can mar@@ vel at an artist 's impression .
However , the most important insights into space are provided by the Hubble space telescope .
Since 24 April 1990 it has been sup@@ plying images of distant worlds .
Since March 2009 the Ke@@ p@@ l@@ er space telescope has been searching for extra@@ -@@ solar plan@@ ets , especially for any that may be i@@ n@@ h@@ a@@ b@@ itable .
On 2 February 2011 it was announced by NASA that 1,2@@ 35 plan@@ e@@ t@@ ary candidates had been identified since the mission began .
The image documents the final launch preparations on the Ke@@ p@@ l@@ er space telescope .
The James Web@@ b Space Telescope ( J@@ W@@ ST ) will be launched into space on board an Ari@@ a@@ n@@ e@@ 5 rocket by 20@@ 18 at the earliest .
The primary mirror of the i@@ n@@ fra@@ red space telescope has a diameter of 6.@@ 5 metres .
One of the telescope 's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and gal@@ a@@ x@@ ies that emerged after the Big Bang .
Scienti@@ sts are assuming that ice also exists at Mer@@ cury 's south p@@ o@@ l@@ e .
However , there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messen@@ ger o@@ r@@ bits around the plan@@ ets much closer to the north p@@ o@@ l@@ e .
For decades , radar m@@ e@@ a@@ s@@ ure@@ ments have indicated that there is ice on Mer@@ cury .
Thanks to the Messen@@ ger probe that was launched in 2004 , the first to orbit Mer@@ cury , scientists can now be certain .
Dr@@ ink butter on a daily basis - and live to 168 years of age
In Southern Azer@@ bai@@ jan , many people reach bib@@ lical ages .
There is even a museum of l@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ vity .
A hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ atively young .
In Southern Azer@@ bai@@ jan , many people reach ages that can almost be considered bib@@ lical .
There is even a museum of l@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ vity .
A hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ atively young .
The journey through the T@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ sh Mountains can be described as wild and roman@@ tic .
The mini@@ bus rum@@ bles over the win@@ ding streets , past d@@ e@@ n@@ sely woo@@ ded hills , r@@ a@@ ging rivers and simple farm@@ houses .
Every@@ where is green and lush - you could be f@@ o@@ r@@ given for thinking you were in the Black Forest .
However , this is the deep south of Azer@@ bai@@ jan , and the border with Iran is just a few kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res away .
This is the home of the Cau@@ casi@@ an people group , the T@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ sh , of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azer@@ i and live long lives .
The final stop is L@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ k .
The small town is bursting with over@@ powering architecture from Soviet times , which doesn 't fit with the pic@@ turesque mountain landscape at all .
Tour@@ ists from Europe rarely come here ; the journey from Azer@@ bai@@ jan 's capital city , B@@ a@@ k@@ u , is too a@@ r@@ d@@ u@@ ous .
It takes eight hours to travel the 3@@ 23 kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res , as too much of the route is just a single track .
The fabulous wealth , for which the country has its oil in the C@@ asp@@ ian Sea to thank , has not yet arrives here in the province .
Yet P@@ i@@ l@@ a@@ t@@ a Fat@@ u@@ l@@ aye@@ va ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ k has what it takes to be a tourist attra@@ ction .
" B@@ a@@ k@@ u became famous in May due to the Euro@@ vision Song C@@ o@@ n@@ test , and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world , " said Fat@@ u@@ l@@ aye@@ va .
She is the Director of the Museum of Lon@@ g@@ e@@ vity , most likely the only of its kind in the world .
Here the lives of eight dozen T@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ sh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented . Fat@@ u@@ l@@ aye@@ va points out a black & white photo .
This here is my grandfather , he was 120 years old .
At the age of 13@@ 6 he fath@@ ered another child .
However , the unri@@ v@@ alled star of the museum is s@@ h@@ e@@ p@@ herd Sh@@ i@@ r@@ ali Mus@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ v who is said to have lived to 168 years old .
However no birth certi@@ ficate exists to confirm this .
And given that the longest confirmed lif@@ esp@@ an was 122 years of age , Mus@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ v 's claim seems extremely doub@@ tful .
" He was born in 18@@ 05 , here in the region , and died in 1973 , " explains Fat@@ u@@ l@@ aye@@ va .
The man married three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fath@@ ered another daughter at the age of 13@@ 6 .
So did Sh@@ i@@ r@@ ali Mus@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ v m@@ i@@ s@@ calculate his age by a couple of decades ?
But Rembrandt S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ z , researcher on age@@ ing at the Max Planck Institute in R@@ o@@ stock , has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia .
" A strikingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the Hun@@ za Valley in Pakistan , " said S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ z , " while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in Sar@@ din@@ ia . "
Due to lacking documentation , however , there is no scientific proof of age , particularly as there are no birth regist@@ ers .
Mel@@ ted butter by the glass , every day
However , the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ k reach a bib@@ lical age with striking regul@@ a@@ r@@ ity .
There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age .
So why do so many very old people live here in the south ?
The Azer@@ i travel guide Far@@ id Mu@@ g@@ i@@ m@@ zadeh explains this as being due to the special T@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ sh gene@@ tics .
In contrast , Museum Director Fat@@ u@@ l@@ aye@@ va believes that it is due to diet .
However the notion that the cal@@ o@@ r@@ ie-@@ rich diet of the T@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ sh , who love meat , bre@@ ad and especially dairy products , and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either .
Or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? In C@@ e@@ n@@ gem@@ i@@ r@@ an , a tiny settlement not far from the town of L@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ k , lives Rub@@ a@@ b@@ a Mir@@ z@@ aye@@ va .
At 97 years old she is still c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ atively young for the area .
Mir@@ z@@ aye@@ va , who claims to have 143 desc@@ end@@ ants , lives in a simple wooden house , which is typical of the entire Caucasus region .
She sits on the floor with a butter chur@@ n , which she rolls back@@ wards and f@@ o@@ r@@ wards tirel@@ essly .
Eight people live here under this roof , including one of Mir@@ z@@ aye@@ va 's sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grandparents for some time .
There are also two small children running around .
In the kitchen , tea is prepared for the guests , which is served in typical , bul@@ ging A@@ r@@ mad@@ u gl@@ asses .
Mir@@ z@@ aye@@ va 's white teeth stand in perfect rank and file , beneath her head@@ scarf she conc@@ e@@ als long , dark blond pla@@ its , which her son proudly reveals for us .
I have always washed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour .
" I have never used s@@ h@@ ampo@@ o either , " said Mir@@ z@@ aye@@ va .
M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ h@@ ly pension is enough to live on
She has only ever eaten what she could get from her own farm - tom@@ atoes , p@@ o@@ tat@@ oes , peas .
My whole life I have never once bought g@@ r@@ o@@ cer@@ ies in the supermarket .
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army .
Things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War .
However , everything became better when the " beloved father " He@@ y@@ dar Ali@@ y@@ e@@ v took the rud@@ der .
The propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lad@@ y .
Yet the cult that revol@@ ved around the father figure for the nation , who g@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ ed his country like a dic@@ tator practi@@ cally knows no limits in Azer@@ bai@@ jan .
He held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the helm .
At least there is no d@@ e@@ priv@@ ation among Azer@@ bai@@ jan 's elderly .
Mir@@ z@@ aye@@ va receives 230 Man@@ at ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably .
And perhaps Mir@@ z@@ aye@@ va 's long gre@@ ying son is right : " The elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture . "
They live among their extended family , are loved , cared for and are happy .
If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible , then what is ?
The notion of " human rights " is o@@ m@@ itted from the constitution .
The revolution has returned to Cairo .
Comp@@ eting demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division within the country .
The future constitution based on Shar@@ ia law is fier@@ cely disputed .
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emo@@ tion .
We must make the transition .
" And making sure it succe@@ eds is my responsibility , before the people and before God , " he said on state television .
His speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the Cop@@ tic Christians , the liber@@ als , enligh@@ tened Muslims and secular@@ ists .
For all of them , until now hop@@ e@@ l@@ essly estranged in a b@@ e@@ w@@ i@@ l@@ dered opposition , are fear@@ ful .
They are fear@@ ful of a God State on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood .
According to Mohamed M@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ i , speaking almost a@@ p@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ e@@ tically , he has temporarily restri@@ cted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority , " in order to rescue the revolution . "
However , Egypti@@ ans - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61-@@ year-old engineer who holds a Doc@@ tor@@ ate from the American University of Southern California , really wants to save .
Should the judiciary be deprived of power ?
In actual fact , the 234 articles , which have been pushed through by the Islam@@ ic-@@ dominated 1@@ 10-@@ person Const@@ itu@@ ent Assembly , are in some aspects cause for concern .
As was also the case under previous constitu@@ tions , under the draft ju@@ dic@@ ature is justified on the " principles of Islamic law . "
Yet what are " principles " ?
This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islam@@ ists will make use of the wo@@ olly f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ ulation and the resulting room for legal manoeu@@ vre in favour of a s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ ter interpretation of Shar@@ ia law .
This is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting Shar@@ ia law , the Al Ash@@ ar University must be consulted , the country 's most important Islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of Sunni Islam .
This can , but does not necessarily have to mean that the cler@@ gy will over@@ see legislation , which would result in the de fac@@ to i@@ n@@ c@@ a@@ p@@ a@@ c@@ itation of the judiciary .
Much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation
Also proble@@ matic : civil military jurisdiction will continue to be upheld .
During M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak 's rule , these courts served to sup@@ press opposition .
Following the fall of the dic@@ tator , up to 11,@@ 000 civilians were under military impris@@ onment .
According to the draft , the state should also protect " the true character of the Egyptian family , and promote its mor@@ als and values . "
From a legal perspective , this is f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ ated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cin@@ e@@ m@@ atic art and literature .
In plain language , this is nothing other than cens@@ orship .
I@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ dent@@ ally , no article explic@@ itly e@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ b@@ l@@ ishes the equality of men and women .
Another does prohibit the insu@@ l@@ t or s@@ lander of the prophe@@ t Mohamed and his e@@ m@@ iss@@ aries .
However , what constit@@ utes an insu@@ l@@ t and how this should be sanc@@ tion@@ ed remains unclear .
Equ@@ ally d@@ u@@ b@@ ious is the f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ ulation stating that " insulting people " is forbidden .
Is a car@@ icature of the president sufficient , or a jo@@ ke at the expense of a j@@ u@@ r@@ ist ?
Open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by M@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ i to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to Egypti@@ ans for referendum " very soon . "
" The revolution is back "
For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islam@@ ists .
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tah@@ r@@ i@@ r Square in Cairo , in unfamiliar unity , and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect .
" The revolution is back and we are going to be vic@@ tor@@ ious , " said Ham@@ d@@ in Sab@@ b@@ a@@ h@@ i , third place candidate in the presidential elections .
Noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority , Mohamed El@@ -@@ Bar@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ i explained that the constitutional draft belongs " on the rub@@ bish tip of history . "
Via SMS service Twit@@ ter , he accused M@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ i 's followers of wanting to lead " a coup against democracy . "
" If he calls for the referendum , we will go to his pal@@ ace and over@@ throw him , " said member of the opposition J@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ er Said .
" We have not yet grown tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been a@@ t@@ oned for , " stated the Egyptian media , quo@@ ting opposition politician C@@ h@@ aled Ali .
And several judges have sign@@ alled that they do not want to over@@ see the referendum , which would render it i@@ n@@ v@@ a@@ l@@ id .
" The Kor@@ an is our constitution "
The well-@@ organ@@ ised Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood gathered for a counter@@ -@@ demonstration , although acting cau@@ tiously they did not choose the Tah@@ r@@ i@@ r Square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile , outside the Cairo University .
Many ve@@ iled women and followers of the Sal@@ a@@ f@@ is took part , shouting out : " The people demand the application of God 's law . "
They demanded of M@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ i : " Cle@@ a@@ n@@ se the country ! " and prote@@ sted : " The Kor@@ an is our constitution . "
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tah@@ r@@ i@@ r Square , where everything began , would have most likely provoked events v@@ e@@ r@@ ging on civil war .
Quite clearly , this was something that M@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ i 's followers did not want to risk .
The Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
Now is the time to let the population decide at the bal@@ lot box , in which direction the country should move forward .
It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islam@@ ists ' draft .
" The term ' human rights ' does not even appear once "
H@@ a@@ f@@ ez Abu Sa@@ eda is fur@@ ious about this forced constitu@@ tive process , which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups .
The 48@@ -year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights ( E@@ O@@ HR ) defended the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood , when impris@@ oned or in court under M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak .
Not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are i@@ n@@ d@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ ble .
For this he was b@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ed , condemned and impris@@ oned .
" And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , " he b@@ e@@ m@@ o@@ a@@ n@@ ed in a discussion with " W@@ e@@ l@@ t am Son@@ n@@ tag . "
The lawyer has resigned himself to M@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ i exten@@ ding his power to all three bran@@ ches of state government .
These measures are blatant bre@@ aches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dict@@ ator@@ ship .
" Instead of s@@ t@@ r@@ eng@@ t@@ h@@ ening the civil society , the President is effectively sus@@ pen@@ ding it , " complained Sa@@ eda .
Yet without civil society organis@@ ations , a democracy cannot function .
Sa@@ eda feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the Nile with a mixture of c@@ u@@ r@@ io@@ sity and excitement .
This could come back to h@@ a@@ unt them .
One demon@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ator at the Tah@@ r@@ i@@ r warned : " You are letting loose a monster that you can no longer control . "
Norway 's r@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k : Is this the world 's sm@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ est fish ?
Norway 's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
Could the secret of the country 's success be connected to the local app@@ e@@ t@@ ite for some exce@@ edingly sm@@ elly fish ?
Take a selection of over-@@ r@@ i@@ pe che@@ eses .
Place them in the mid@@ st of a pile of dirty , wet socc@@ er kit .
Leave for a week .
Now you have the nose-@@ num@@ bing sm@@ ell of r@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k , one of the great Norwegian del@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ c@@ ies .
I am in the small town of Fag@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ es , about three hours from Oslo .
There is snow , spectac@@ ular scener@@ y - and that od@@ our , ever present , hang@@ s in the air .
R@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k is t@@ r@@ o@@ ut sprin@@ kled with salt and f@@ e@@ r@@ mented in water for - depending on how sm@@ elly you like your fish - up to a year .
As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , Nor@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ans flo@@ ck to a festival here in Fag@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ es devoted to this most , well , cap@@ tiv@@ ating of foods .
" You eat it raw , and then s@@ wal@@ low a glass of aqu@@ a@@ v@@ it , " says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , full-time local firefighter but also the so-called " R@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k General , " in charge of running the festival .
All around us people are eating little cub@@ es of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink .
" Some people like the aqu@@ a@@ v@@ it more than the r@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k , " says Hav@@ ard .
The drink can kill the sm@@ ell .
I try a few pieces .
If you can avoid passing it under your n@@ o@@ se , it is not bad - not unlike a slice of sus@@ hi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
R@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k is a product of very different , p@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ty-@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ en times in Norway when , pre-@@ refriger@@ ation , fish was s@@ o@@ aked in air@@ tight barrels of water and salt in autum@@ n .
Then in the depths of winter , well and truly f@@ e@@ r@@ mented , it is taken out and - no doubt with the s@@ e@@ n@@ ses knocked out by alcohol - eaten .
Only a generation ago , thousands of Nor@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , e@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ rating mainly to the US .
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by p@@ l@@ enti@@ ful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
People from Sweden , the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway , stream in to work .
R@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k is seen as sign@@ if@@ ying something important , a vital if rather sm@@ elly part of Norway 's past .
It is among the more expensive dish@@ es you can buy .
But then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich knock you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way .
People here are still l@@ o@@ ath to mention by name Anders Brei@@ v@@ i@@ k , the right-@@ wing , rac@@ ist extrem@@ ist who gun@@ ned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
Instead , the shootings are referred to as " the July the 22nd incident . "
Nor@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their p@@ e@@ a@@ c@@ e@@ -@@ loving country one of their own was capable of such brut@@ ality and murder .
The growth since the early 1970s of one of the world 's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway 's p@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ ent-@@ day wealth .
" But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , " says Anna our wa@@ i@@ t@@ ress , handing round trays of maturing r@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k and , with her long blond hair and s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of Nor@@ dic well-@@ being .
We are a - how you say - prudent people .
Her English , like that of most people here , is f@@ law@@ less .
We are not very show@@ y , we do not like o@@ s@@ t@@ entation .
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future gener@@ ations .
When everyone else was throwing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its pur@@ se strings tigh@@ tly bound .
" As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer we are happy , " says Anna .
" And eat r@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k , " she adds with a care@@ free laugh .
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough r@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k .
Now an e@@ l@@ k burger is certainly something different and rather s@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ ent to the taste .
But in the evening , it is more of that sm@@ elly fish .
The hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a r@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nas@@ ally challenging - fish .
There is a live TV link up to a c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ ere in a b@@ o@@ w tie surrounded by p@@ l@@ ates of r@@ a@@ k@@ fis@@ k .
It is like the Euro@@ vision song contest .
" What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains T@@ h@@ or-@@ Ju@@ e@@ r@@ gen ? "
" Here are our points , Hav@@ ard . "
There is clapping , laugh@@ ter .
A man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with aqu@@ a@@ v@@ it .
Or maybe it is the f@@ u@@ m@@ es from all that fish .
Mexico 's E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to faces tough start
As Mexico 's incoming President E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to prepares to take office , the BBC 's Will Grant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present .
A congest@@ ed city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been e@@ r@@ ected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing c@@ h@@ a@@ os on the roads .
The aim , however , wasn 't to stop commu@@ ters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament .
On Saturday , Mexico 's new president E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation .
He faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been performing well econom@@ ically under the out@@ going administration of F@@ e@@ l@@ ipe Calderon , but the country is in the grip of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years .
" My government has a great commitment to the Mex@@ ican people to reduce the violence , " Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim .
Before rub@@ bing shoulders with the US president , Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to 's previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the State of Mexico .
A p@@ o@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ous , sprawling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old stom@@ ping ground .
A stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward man
In the b@@ u@@ c@@ o@@ lic town of V@@ a@@ l@@ le del Bra@@ vo , for example , he is remember@@ ed fon@@ dly .
Residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure .
To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to 's new motor@@ ways , a vast improvement on the cracked and bum@@ py roads it replaced .
Pla@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change .
" We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , " says friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ a Hern@@ andez , a state congres@@ sman for Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to 's party , the PR@@ I .
P@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ cul@@ arly in terms of security and the economy , we 're hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so bad@@ ly needs .
After an u@@ n@@ broken 81 years in power , the PR@@ I was ousted in 2000 by Vic@@ e@@ n@@ te Fox .
Congres@@ sman Ol@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ a admits that after 12 years outside the presidential pal@@ ace of Los Pin@@ os , there is much expectation within the party about E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to .
And he rejects the opposition 's character@@ isation of the new president as lacking substance .
He 's a very stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
He 's an excellent stat@@ esman and , above all , he 's someone who knows how to listen .
But on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former governor .
In N@@ e@@ z@@ a@@ h@@ u@@ a@@ l@@ c@@ o@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ l , also known as Ciudad N@@ e@@ za , the contrast with the c@@ o@@ b@@ b@@ l@@ ed streets of V@@ a@@ l@@ le del Bra@@ vo couldn 't be shar@@ per .
Tu@@ cked away under motorway fl@@ y@@ o@@ vers , it is in many ways a subur@@ b of Mexico City itself .
And the problems in the mun@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality are also g@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ ty and urban .
Earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ bour@@ hoods , and violence against women is particularly acute .
On a patch of wast@@ eland by a vast land@@ fill site , the bodies of dozens of mur@@ dered women have been dumped over the past two years alone .
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to was governor , a rate much higher than in the notor@@ i@@ ously violent city of Ciudad Ju@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ z - a place s@@ y@@ non@@ y@@ m@@ ous with the murder of innocent women .
Mr P@@ ena Nie@@ to 's critics say , at best , he failed to adequ@@ ately address the problem of f@@ e@@ m@@ icide while he was in office .
At worst , they a@@ c@@ c@@ use his administration of turning a blind eye .
In a concrete home typical of the rundown n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ bour@@ hood , I@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ea Bu@@ e@@ n@@ dia strugg@@ les to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter , M@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ ana Lun@@ a .
According to the official version of events , M@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ ana committed suicide in 2010 .
However her family believes she was mur@@ dered by her partner .
" When I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been washed , " Sen@@ ora Bu@@ e@@ n@@ dia recalls .
There were signs she 'd been beaten , and r@@ i@@ g@@ or mor@@ tis had already set in .
As her mother r@@ e@@ counts the story , a picture of M@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ ana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : Justice .
However , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
The state authorities have treated me like I 'm an old gossip , a troub@@ le-@@ maker , a w@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ er .
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shut@@ s up .
" But that can 't be right when there were so many i@@ r@@ regul@@ arities and omissions , " she says .
As President P@@ ena Nie@@ to receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy responsibility .
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
" I hope he 's the same kind of president as he was a governor , " says PR@@ I Congres@@ sman Ol@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ a in V@@ a@@ l@@ le del Bra@@ vo .
That , however , is exactly what victims ' families in Ciudad N@@ e@@ za most fear .
Bradley Manning didn 't complain about mist@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ ment , prosecutors contend
Prosecutors try to counter Bradley Manning 's claims of abuse in confin@@ ement
The hearing focuses on Manning 's time in the military bri@@ g at Q@@ u@@ anti@@ co , Virginia
Defense wants case dismissed on grounds that Manning 's confin@@ ement was harsh
The Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents
Prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bradley Manning -- charged in the largest l@@ e@@ a@@ k of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mist@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ ment he 's alleging he suffered in military custody .
While cross-@@ exam@@ ining Manning at a pre-@@ trial hearing at F@@ t . M@@ e@@ ade , Maryland , prosecutor Maj@@ . Ash@@ den F@@ ein asserted that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Q@@ u@@ anti@@ co , Virginia , show no complaints about his treatment .
The cross-@@ examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have Manning 's case dismissed on grounds that his confin@@ ement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody .
The Army intelligence analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq .
The material was then published online by W@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ L@@ e@@ aks .
W@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ L@@ e@@ aks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information .
In Friday 's hearing , F@@ ein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Q@@ u@@ anti@@ co 's bri@@ g , where he was held under a heightened confin@@ ement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses .
When F@@ ein asked about the forms Friday , Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as " excellent " and treatment by the facility overall as " very professional . "
The forms show no complaints of mist@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ ment , even though the officers asked Manning directly about his treatment , F@@ ein conten@@ ded .
Manning responded that he would v@@ e@@ r@@ b@@ ally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn 't record the issues .
" They would write down ' no issues ' ( after discuss@@ ing the concerns ) , and it didn 't necessarily mean I didn 't bring something up , " Manning said .
The judge , Army Col. Den@@ ise L@@ ind , also asked Manning why he didn 't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board exam@@ ining the s@@ u@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ al thou@@ ghts he expressed in a form months earlier .
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get his " prevention of injury " status down@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ded .
The military said they put him on this restri@@ ctive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
" I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the PO@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my vie@@ w@@ point , " Manning said .
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was held for nearly two months before being trans@@ ferred to the bri@@ g at Marine Base Q@@ u@@ anti@@ co in Virginia in July 2010 .
He said he contem@@ p@@ l@@ ated suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there due to the heat .
He said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was dist@@ ressing .
" My world just shr@@ ink to Camp Ara@@ f@@ j@@ on , to that cage , " Manning said Thursday .
I thought I was going to die in that cage .
Once at Q@@ u@@ anti@@ co , Manning said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
Manning said he was allowed only a matt@@ ress , blan@@ ket , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps , some clothes and his gl@@ asses .
He said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
Manning said he always slept with light from outside his cell in his eyes .
If guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
Manning 's lawyer filed a formal objec@@ tion to Manning 's treatment in January 2011 .
Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Leav@@ enworth , Kansas , in April 2011 .
Also Friday , the judge asked Manning about an alleg@@ ation that he made in Thursday 's testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Q@@ u@@ anti@@ co cell , he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count .
Manning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blan@@ ket during the head count .
Under questioning from the judge Friday , Manning said that he i@@ n@@ ferred from his guard 's order that he should drop a blan@@ ket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn 't a danger to himself .
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the wa@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ band of his under@@ wear or his fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps to hurt himself but hadn 't done so .
That night , Manning testified , his under@@ wear , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps and gl@@ asses were removed from his cell .
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confin@@ ement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his cour@@ t-@@ mar@@ tial , which is expected to begin early next year .
The defense has said it plans to have Manning ple@@ ad guilty to less@@ er offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warran@@ ted .
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with rules governing all maxim@@ um-@@ custody detainees at Q@@ u@@ anti@@ co .
Coun@@ ts against Manning include ai@@ ding the enemy , wrong@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , trans@@ mitting national defense information and theft of public property or records .
If he 's convicted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .
My Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans of hard times , he says
Nav@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ tte says Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got stum@@ ped .
Signs pointed the way to two lines : one for " Mex@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ os " ( " Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans " ) , another for " E@@ x@@ tran@@ jer@@ os " ( " Foreig@@ ners . " )
I stood there for a few seconds , unsure of where to go .
Gro@@ wing up in Central California , I had been called a " Mex@@ ican " my entire life .
It 's ethnic shor@@ t@@ h@@ and in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as " Irish " or my friends in New York describe themselves as " Italian . "
Later , I settled on " Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ American . "
But , this was Mexico .
And , in the homeland of my grandfather , there was no need for shor@@ t@@ h@@ and or hy@@ p@@ h@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language .
But I don 't have the voc@@ abul@@ ary of a native , and I can 't shake my American accent .
So I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for E@@ x@@ tran@@ jer@@ os .
I thought about that moment this week when Mex@@ ican president@@ -@@ elect E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena Nie@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
On the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
P@@ ena Nie@@ to was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mex@@ ican economy , which is one reason that Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States .
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European Union@@ -@@ style trading bloc in North America .
And P@@ ena Nie@@ to vowed to continue Mexico 's war against the drug car@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ s , even though he offered no spec@@ if@@ ics .
For Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings .
Most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 18@@ 48 , the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle .
But for Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the remin@@ ders are everywhere .
So the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mex@@ ican press , and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are e@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ o@@ aching upon their neighbor 's sovereign@@ ty .
And the children of M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ zum@@ a go on the w@@ a@@ r@@ path .
And yet , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans living in the United States .
You want to talk about hard feelings ?
There is plenty .
Mexico has winners and l@@ o@@ s@@ ers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn 't .
The only reason you have so many people of Mex@@ ican anc@@ estry living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Denver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ parent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north .
And more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor village , e@@ t@@ c .
We 're their offspring , and we 're loyal to them .
Not Mexico .
And even though we may now be living the American Dream , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it 's the American Dream we 're living , and not the Mex@@ ican one .
Our identity might sometimes be f@@ u@@ z@@ zy , but our loy@@ alty is clear .
It 's to the United States .
Besides , we 're aware that many of the elite Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans in the ruling class don 't like us .
The feeling is mut@@ ual .
They see us as a reminder of a hum@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ating defeat and look down on us as i@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ior stock that isn 't sufficiently Mex@@ ican .
Our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough .
Our existence is , as they see it , all about failure .
If our families hadn 't failed in Mexico , they wouldn 't have left .
And we wouldn 't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain , living well in the United States but lost sou@@ ls nonetheless .
My wife , who was born in Gu@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ l@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States leg@@ ally as a child , remin@@ ds me that there is f@@ r@@ i@@ ction between Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans and Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans because Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans have a firmer gras@@ p of who they are and Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans r@@ e@@ s@@ ent that .
While she 's a U.S. citi@@ zen , she sees herself as a part of two countries .
Meanwhile , many Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans I know don 't feel like they 're a part of either .
We love listening to the Mex@@ ican band , Los T@@ i@@ g@@ res del Nor@@ te , but also to Bruce Spring@@ ste@@ en .
You get the best of both worlds , but you 're rooted in neither .
In Mexico , we 're seen as Americans .
And in the United States , we 're considered Mex@@ ican .
Now , to complic@@ ate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mex@@ ican leaders and parts of the intellig@@ entsia want to r@@ e@@ connect with the D@@ i@@ a@@ s@@ pora .
They want to put Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans to work as makeshift " ambassa@@ dors " for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States .
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico .
Ye@@ ah .
That 's not going to happen .
Too many hard feelings .
And , with income inequality and ramp@@ ant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I 'm afraid you 're on your own , a@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ os .
That 's fair .
If at least some Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans aren 't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-@@ Americans still hold a gru@@ dge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
H@@ mm@@ m .
Maybe we 're more " Mex@@ ican " than I thought .
Old batt@@ les , new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East ?
Another round of bloo@@ dshed suggests that any such hope is v@@ ain .
Am@@ id the usual fut@@ ile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rub@@ ble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed ; and , for the first time , missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv , Israel 's metro@@ p@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ s , and the holy city of Jerusalem .
But though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing .
The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil .
Maybe this will make their struggle bloo@@ d@@ i@@ er than before .
However , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stal@@ e@@ m@@ ate .
A war that is neither lost or won
At first sight , optimism looks very hard to justify now .
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds , this week 's fighting has strengthened the haw@@ ks on both sides .
The leaders of Hamas , the Islam@@ ist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ b@@ bing .
Despite killing some of its leaders and bott@@ ling up Gaza 's 1.@@ 7m people in one of the most wret@@ ched and crowded cor@@ ners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas .
Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , Hamas 's leaders may well conclu@@ de that time is on their side .
As Islam@@ ists across the Arab world have gained clout , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
Turkey , a resurgent regional power that was once Israel 's closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas 's cause ; so has Qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states .
Jub@@ ilant Hamas people say an Islam@@ ist c@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ cent is c@@ u@@ r@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the Hiz@@ bul@@ lah part@@ y-@@ cum@@ -@@ militia holds s@@ way , through Syria , where rebels of an increasingly Islam@@ ist bent may topp@@ le Bash@@ ar Assad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas 's allies are m@@ e@@ n@@ acing the king .
Above all , on Israel 's southern flan@@ k , the rise of the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood under President Muhammad Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most p@@ o@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ous and pivotal of Arab countries , has changed the region 's balance .
H@@ o@@ sn@@ i M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak , the secular d@@ e@@ s@@ pot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas .
By contrast , the Bro@@ ther@@ hood is a cousin of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America .
Meanwhile , Israel 's hard@@ liners will draw the opposite conclu@@ sions .
In military terms , Hamas has been put back in its box .
Israel 's Ir@@ on Dome anti-@@ missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas 's missiles have been destroyed .
Israelis will sleep more sound@@ ly - for a while .
In diplomatic terms , America is as ste@@ a@@ d@@ fast as ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
Above all , Israel has prosp@@ ered , especially under Bin@@ y@@ amin Net@@ any@@ a@@ h@@ u , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
Although rock@@ ets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of s@@ u@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ de-@@ bombers , thanks in part to the bar@@ rier that bit@@ es into the West Bank , the main c@@ h@@ unk of a would-be Palestinian state , and protects the Jewish sett@@ l@@ e@@ ments that continue to expand despite their i@@ l@@ leg@@ ality in international law .
Mr Net@@ any@@ a@@ h@@ u , whose Lik@@ u@@ d party has m@@ e@@ r@@ ged with an even more haw@@ kish lot under Av@@ i@@ g@@ d@@ or Lie@@ berman in the run@@ -up to an election on January 22nd , is sitting pretty .
Why c@@ o@@ d@@ dle those t@@ w@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ y Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ?
If they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire rock@@ ets , just as their compatri@@ ots have done in Gaza ?
Bet@@ ter to keep them behind that wall and s@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ e them if they raise their heads .
Maybe the hard@@ liners will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations .
Even if the Islam@@ ists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
Israel 's defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
Starting a war with the local super@@ power will hardly help the new Arab governments m@@ end their economies .
That the pra@@ g@@ matic Mr Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire a@@ u@@ g@@ urs well - and might just mark the start of something .
Israelis too should look to the longer term .
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depri@@ ving Palestinians of their right to self-@@ determination is creating a powder k@@ e@@ g that is bound one day to explo@@ de in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week .
R@@ e@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ sion is already under@@ mining democracy in the Jewish state , and demograph@@ y e@@ x@@ a@@ c@@ e@@ r@@ b@@ ates this as the Arab population sw@@ ells .
Bloo@@ dy missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll .
Both sides need p@@ r@@ o@@ d@@ ding by outsiders
The answer remains the one trum@@ pet@@ ed by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel ced@@ ing territory for security .
The hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Qatar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land sw@@ aps and a shared Jerusalem .
Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together .
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual stat@@ e@@ h@@ ood at the UN .
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
During his first term , he neg@@ lec@@ ted to present his own plan for peace .
Back in the White House , he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in .
This is wo@@ efully short-@@ sigh@@ ted .
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians .
C@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ tte plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
S@@ m@@ o@@ king warnings and dise@@ ased body parts e@@ m@@ bla@@ z@@ oned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia 's world-@@ first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand logos and colo@@ urs with gener@@ ic dra@@ b olive green coverings , gru@@ esome pictures of dise@@ ased body parts and depic@@ tions of children and babies made ill by their parents ' smoking .
Apart from the varying health warnings and images the only difference between the packs , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small f@@ ont .
It is the world 's most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .
Australia 's federal government says the aim is to d@@ e@@ ter young people from smoking by s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ pping the habit of glam@@ our .
It is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
" Even from a very early age you can see that kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their branding , " said the federal health minister , Tanya P@@ liber@@ s@@ e@@ k , citing studies that showed , for example , children linking a crown in a logo with the idea of being a pr@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ ess .
While Australia has one of the world 's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on mul@@ tin@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ als ' profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
The tobacco industry lob@@ b@@ ied hard against the laws .
T@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigarettes .
" There will be serious u@@ n@@ intended consequences from the legislation , " said Scott Mc@@ I@@ n@@ ty@@ re of British American T@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o Australia .
Counter@@ f@@ e@@ i@@ t@@ ers from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia .
Others say the laws have boosted their business .
Sandra H@@ a of Z@@ ico Im@@ port P@@ ty Ltd , a small family business , said demand for cigarette cases , s@@ i@@ lic@@ on covers to mas@@ k the u@@ n@@ pal@@ a@@ t@@ able pack@@ ages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American T@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o , Britain 's Imper@@ ial T@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o , Philip Morris and Japan T@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o lost a challenge to the laws in Australia 's high court .
H@@ a said Z@@ ico had sold up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock .
This is good business for us .
The potential h@@ i@@ t@@ ch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demograph@@ ic the plan is targeting .
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites .
" If you are a tobacco m@@ a@@ r@@ k@@ e@@ t@@ er and you 've only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the compelling place for you to be in , " said Beck@@ y Freeman , a public health researcher at Sydney University .
Freeman noted an increase in " average Joe " reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube , Twit@@ ter and Facebook .
We have to ask , is that just a private citi@@ zen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and they 've gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American T@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being u@@ n@@ fairly restri@@ cted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia .
A WTO ruling is likely in mid-@@ 20@@ 13 .
P@@ liber@@ s@@ e@@ k said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging .
Canada was the first country to make photograph warnings mandatory in 2001 .
They now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
Tou@@ g@@ her laws are being considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
Many smo@@ kers in Australia remain defiant .
The pictures don 't affect me .
I just ign@@ ore them .
" You just grab a smoke and put it away , " said Victor El H@@ age as he purchased a pack with a photograph of a mouth tum@@ our .
Hon@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ly , there 's only one reason I 'd stop , and that 's my little girl .
James Y@@ u , who runs the King of the Pack t@@ o@@ bac@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uniform packaging made it harder to stack his shelves
" It used to take me an hour to u@@ n@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , " Y@@ u said .
" The government should have just banned them altogether and then we 'd go OK , fine , we 're done , we 'll shut up shop , " he said , throwing his hands up in the air .
In a Const@@ antly P@@ l@@ u@@ g@@ ged-@@ In World , It 's Not All Bad to Be B@@ o@@ red
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
I won 't lie to you .
Half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty t@@ e@@ dious , even with the distra@@ ctions of books , magazines and iPhones ( not to mention d@@ u@@ t@@ y-@@ free shopping ) .
But increasingly , some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
It 's all right for us - and our children - to be b@@ o@@ red on occasion , they say .
It forces the brain to go on interesting t@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ ents , perhaps fostering creativity .
And because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days , we don 't experience the benefits of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
So should we embrace b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom ?
Yes .
And no .
But I 'll get back to that .
First of all , like many people , I assum@@ ed that b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the adv@@ ent of more leisure time .
Not so , says Peter Too@@ h@@ e@@ y , a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Cal@@ g@@ ary in Canada and the author of " B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom : A Li@@ vely History " ( Yale University Press , 2011 ) .
" B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom actually has a very long history , " he said .
There 's Latin graffiti about b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom on the walls of Pom@@ p@@ e@@ i@@ i dating from the first century .
Then there 's the question of how we define b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
The trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D. Eastwood , an associate professor of psychology at York University in On@@ tar@@ io , Canada .
After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom as an experience of " wanting to , but being unable to engage in satis@@ fying activity . "
What separ@@ ates b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom from a@@ p@@ ath@@ y , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
With a@@ p@@ ath@@ y , he said , there is no urge to do something .
The core experience of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom , he said , is " dis@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . "
B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom can sound an awful lot like depression .
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can be related , people who are b@@ o@@ red tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves .
Sometimes we think we 're b@@ o@@ red when we just have difficulty concentr@@ ating .
In their study , " The U@@ n@@ engaged M@@ ind : D@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ n@@ ing B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom in Ter@@ ms of Attention , " which appeared in the journal Per@@ spec@@ tives on Psych@@ ological Science in September , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier exper@@ iment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely noti@@ ce@@ able , while the third group didn 't hear the soundtrack at all .
The ones who heard the low-@@ level TV reported more b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentr@@ ating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
When you 're trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task , dis@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ tion of attention can lead to b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom , said Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , an associate professor of neu@@ r@@ o@@ science at the University of Gu@@ e@@ l@@ ph in On@@ tar@@ io and one of the authors of the study .
On the other hand , when you 're doing something dull , " such as looking for bad wid@@ gets on a factory line , distra@@ cting music can help you not be b@@ o@@ red . "
In fact , he said , we now know that squ@@ i@@ r@@ ming and d@@ o@@ o@@ dling , often seen as a sign of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert .
" Research shows that kids who are allowed to f@@ i@@ dget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , " Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
We all experience b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom at some points - my flight delay , a d@@ r@@ oning speaker , a particularly t@@ e@@ dious movie .
But some individuals are more likely to be b@@ o@@ red than others .
To help measure this , researchers developed a " B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom P@@ ron@@ eness Sc@@ ale " in the 1980s .
The scale includes questions like , " Many things I have to do are repet@@ itive and m@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ ton@@ ous , " and " I have so many interests , I don 't have time to do everything . "
Using such s@@ c@@ ales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be b@@ o@@ red more often than girls , said Stephen Vo@@ d@@ a@@ n@@ o@@ vich , a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida , especially when it comes needing more , and a variety of , external stim@@ ulation .
But in general , teenagers are a pretty j@@ aded lot .
In 1991 , Reed Larson , a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois , conducted an exper@@ iment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by b@@ e@@ eper .
He found that 32 percent of a@@ d@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cents said they were b@@ o@@ red in school and doing home@@ work , while 23 percent said they were b@@ o@@ red when they weren 't in school .
On the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were b@@ o@@ red .
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom p@@ e@@ r@@ cent@@ ages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
But he said he did know that " a@@ d@@ o@@ l@@ escence is a peak period for b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom , " largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
So back to my original question : Is b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom good for you ?
Sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gam@@ ble or ind@@ u@@ l@@ ge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
On the other hand , many p@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ p@@ hers and writers discuss the connection between b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom and creativity , said Professor Vo@@ d@@ a@@ n@@ o@@ vich , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades .
" B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom is the brain 's way to tell you you should be doing something else , " said Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology at N.@@ Y@@ .@@ U .
But the brain doesn 't always know the most appropriate thing to do .
If you 're b@@ o@@ red and use that energy to play guitar and cook , it will make you happy .
But if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
So if your child is b@@ o@@ red and you give him an i@@ Pad , he may not be b@@ o@@ red anymore , but he hasn 't learned how to enter@@ tain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ ens@@ ke said .
And " that self-@@ regulation transfers from one situation to other , " he said .
Your kid doesn 't just learn to enter@@ tain himself , but gets more self-@@ control in other areas .
I don 't think we really want to celebrate b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
Nor should we be too critical of it .
Rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant c@@ h@@ a@@ t@@ ter of activity and technology .
Professor Eastwood agreed .
" We frame it as we need to be b@@ o@@ red more , but b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom is an a@@ g@@ o@@ n@@ izing , rest@@ less desire to be connected with something meaningful , " he said .
What people are really searching for , he said , is a way to u@@ n@@ plug and enjoy down time .
" In an environment where we are const@@ antly over@@ stim@@ u@@ l@@ ated , " he said , " it 's hard to find ways to engage when the noise shut@@ s down . "
In Colorado , No Play@@ book for New M@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ ju@@ ana Law
Anthony Oro@@ zco , 19 , a community college student and socc@@ er player in southeastern Colorado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few nu@@ ggets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
Mr. Oro@@ zco said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lamar , on the plain@@ s near the Kansas border , when they were pulled over .
After the police officer found marijuana in the car , Mr. Oro@@ zco was issued a sum@@ mons for possession and drug p@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ alia - pet@@ ty offenses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
" We get treated like criminals , " Mr. Oro@@ zco said .
But is he one ?
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado 's vote to leg@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ ze small amounts of marijuana for r@@ e@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ ational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small-@@ scale possession that will be leg@@ ally sanc@@ tion@@ ed once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
But prosecutors in more conservative prec@@ incts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession .
At the same time , several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state-@@ licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities .
" This thing is evolving so quickly that I don 't know what 's going to happen next , " said Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in Aurora , just east of Denver .
Reg@@ u@@ l@@ ators in Washington State are also scrat@@ ching their heads .
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec. 1 , 20@@ 13 .
They say that Colorado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regul@@ ating marijuana , first for medical use and now r@@ e@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ ationally .
" Colorado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , " said Brian E. Smith , a spokesman for the Washington State Liqu@@ or Control Board .
But no place or system , Mr. Smith conceded , can do more than suggest what might work .
" There 's no real preced@@ ent for us to follow , " he said .
Washington 's law , called I-@@ 502 , takes effect on Dec. 6 , which also leaves a year of lim@@ bo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but leg@@ alized possession will .
And there are thor@@ ny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state 's mand@@ ate of " adequate access " to licensed marijuana with its prohib@@ itions on cann@@ abis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , play@@ ground or child care center .
" Nowhere will it be more difficult to site a licensed cann@@ abis business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle metro@@ polit@@ an area , " said Ben Living@@ s@@ t@@ on , a spokesman for the Center for Legal C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ abis , a recently formed research group .
On Nov. 21 , Chief O@@ ates in Aurora sent his officers an e-mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecut@@ ing small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes " effective immediately . "
Chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city c@@ o@@ des regul@@ ating medical marijuana growers , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers .
In northern Colorado 's Wel@@ d County , the district attorney , Ken Bu@@ ck , represents a s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ ter view .
After the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
Right now , 1@@ 19 people face charges of poss@@ essing two ounces or less of marijuana , though many are facing other charges .
" Our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were crimes at the time they occurred , " Mr. Bu@@ ck said in a statement .
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mes@@ a County , where voters rejected the marijuana initiative .
The police in Grand Jun@@ ction , the county 's largest city , are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts .
The county 's district attorney , Pete Hau@@ t@@ z@@ inger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases .
" I do not think I 'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , " he said .
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure , bringing r@@ e@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ ational marijuana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
And the contra@@ dic@@ tory reactions across the state lay bare a deep a@@ m@@ bi@@ val@@ ence among local officials about the state 's big green exper@@ iment .
" It 's a cultural bar@@ rier " with district attorneys , said Sean Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of M@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ ju@@ ana La@@ ws .
" They spent so much of their lives prosecut@@ ing people that they still don 't really accept that this is legal , " he said .
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug leg@@ alization .
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of leg@@ alized sales , they are also anx@@ i@@ ously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cul@@ tiv@@ ation of marijuana as federal crimes .
Advoc@@ ates for leg@@ alized marijuana are hoping the Justice Department yields .
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado , Washington and 16 other states .
While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to sei@@ ze a small bag of the drug , they are likely to bal@@ k at allowing the state-@@ regulated r@@ e@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ ational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws , said Kevin A. Sa@@ bet , a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration .
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
Even before Ele@@ ction Day , some local governments approved mor@@ a@@ t@@ ori@@ ums on any new marijuana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
Last week , the western city of M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ se took up a six-@@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
" We don 't want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue , " said Bob N@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ son , a City Council member .
Our community voted against this amend@@ ment .
We 're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for .
There 's an awful lot of questions .
Pet@@ ron@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ a Wyatt : I was bul@@ lied out of Oxford for being a Tory
It is not just today 's university students who are attacked for their views
I can 't remember a time when I didn 't dream of winning a place at Oxford University .
Both my father and my elder brother had been at what I imagined was the world 's greatest seat of learning , a moder@@ n-@@ day win@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ l@@ ush@@ ed Greek s@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ i@@ um encouraging the dual p@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ars of c@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ l@@ isation , free thinking and toler@@ ance .
Yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at Wor@@ c@@ ester College in the late Eigh@@ ties to read history , I 'd packed my bags , precip@@ itating the first scandal of my life .
My father broke down and cried .
Friends were b@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ led .
The Even@@ ing Standard diary claimed I 'd quit because I objected to fellow under@@ graduates having sex in the room next to mine .
The writer A N Wilson announced wag@@ g@@ ish@@ ly that I 'd depar@@ ted because I was forced to drink out of chi@@ pped mugs .
The truth was less dro@@ ll .
I ran away .
Yes , ran , because I had been subject to s@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ m@@ atic bullying and intimid@@ ation .
Not on account of my rather o@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was persec@@ uted for one reason only , and in this cra@@ dle of supposed enligh@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ ment it was both big@@ o@@ ted and bar@@ bar@@ ic : my father , the late Woo@@ dro@@ w Wyatt , was a high-profile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter .
Why bring this up now , you might ask .
Well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of R@@ igh@@ t-@@ of-@@ centre students are suffering a similar persec@@ ution .
Such is the institu@@ tion@@ alised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equ@@ al-@@ rights protection as gays , disa@@ b@@ l@@ ed people and ethnic minorities .
Conservative members of Cor@@ p@@ us C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ i College 's junior common room ( J@@ CR ) claim they are " often actively isol@@ ated , personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome " because of their political views .
They want to create a post on the college 's equ@@ al opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired fre@@ ely .
Their situation wasn 't helped by a recent BBC Two documentary , Won@@ derland : Young , Bright and on the Right , about student politics , which portra@@ yed Tor@@ ies as od@@ d@@ balls and neo-@@ Naz@@ is .
It featured graduate Joe Coo@@ ke , former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association ( O@@ UC@@ A ) , trav@@ elling in a Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce , sporting a silver suit and sil@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ -@@ topp@@ ed can@@ e .
At other universities , Conservative students say they are being treated as " s@@ c@@ a@@ p@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ ats " for the introduction of higher tuition fees . "
Luke Black , 20 , vice-president of Nottingham University Conservative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing L@@ e@@ f@@ t-@@ wing bi@@ as at universities .
People assume we are like the Bull@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ don Club without meeting us . "
Samuel Roberts , 21 , a history student at Cor@@ p@@ us C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ i , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is " uncomfortable , " while Stephanie Cher@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ UC@@ A , says there has been a deterior@@ ation in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Right of centre .
" This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , " she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford .
I had gone up in September 1986 , a cri@@ p@@ p@@ l@@ ingly shy 18-year-old .
Hat@@ red of the Conservative Party was at its most f@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ ile .
The year before , the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an hon@@ o@@ r@@ ary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
The atmosphere would have made a S@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ n@@ ist s@@ h@@ u@@ d@@ der with a@@ p@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ hen@@ sion .
During the first few days of fresh@@ ers " week , when new students soci@@ alise with each other and the d@@ ons , I had a taste of the w@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only c@@ o@@ n@@ ni@@ ved in the t@@ a@@ unting of Tory under@@ graduates but took part with rel@@ ish .
The politics of the miners " strike , priv@@ a@@ t@@ isation and the government 's opposition to sanctions against a@@ p@@ arth@@ e@@ i@@ d South Africa were brought into the woo@@ d-@@ pan@@ elled rooms of the tut@@ orial .
My first one involved trans@@ l@@ ating 18@@ th-century French tex@@ ts into English , and I was unprepared for what followed .
" Miss Wyatt , " said the don , Harry Pitt ( now dec@@ eased ) , " please trans@@ late the first paragra@@ ph . "
I stumbled over it .
A small man with a face like cake bat@@ ter , Pitt was big on b@@ ile .
" Do That@@ cher@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid ? " he demanded .
The other under@@ graduates gig@@ gled .
Te@@ ars p@@ r@@ i@@ cked the back of my eyes .
" I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is , if you 're not too busy soci@@ a@@ l@@ ising , " Pitt s@@ nar@@ led .
I walked back to my rooms a dis@@ consol@@ ate figure .
At dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
It was a second-@@ year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ UC@@ A .
" I know who you are , " he said kind@@ ly .
I 'm afraid it 's like that .
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is picked on .
It 's bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so it will be worse for you .
Most Tory fresh@@ ers pretend they 're Labour .
Later , at a local pub , I cra@@ ven@@ ly attempted to dis@@ simul@@ ate .
I insisted that I didn 't agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said .
This plo@@ y proved unsuccessful .
A first year PP@@ E student , who , i@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ically , had been to E@@ ton , said : " You 're the daughter of a fas@@ c@@ ist pig . "
You 're contaminated .
Other students took up the refra@@ in .
I was perverted , dirty .
" How do Tor@@ ies have sex ? " one asked .
They beat each other , don 't they ?
I felt the way homosexu@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Six@@ ties .
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford ?
Would I be forced to meet lik@@ e-minded people only after dark ?
Would I have to turn to Labour and sup@@ press my natural inclin@@ ations ?
The three years before me stret@@ ched out as a pur@@ g@@ atory of o@@ stra@@ cism and isolation .
The only openly Tory don was Nor@@ man Stone , Professor of Modern History , who was based at my college .
He was h@@ ated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers .
He was hardly ever there .
He loathed the place as provincial and pet@@ ty , and for its adher@@ ence to the M@@ a@@ r@@ x@@ ist-@@ determin@@ ist view of history .
In 1997 he took up a prof@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ orship at the University of B@@ i@@ l@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey .
" You won 't be happy here , " he told me .
I began comm@@ uting from Oxford to my parents " house in London , finding refu@@ ge with my more open-@@ minded metro@@ polit@@ an friends and family .
I told my father I h@@ ated Oxford and why .
He was i@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ d@@ u@@ l@@ ous .
During his time there in the F@@ o@@ r@@ ties , all political views had been accepted .
" But it 's the best place in the world , " he said path@@ e@@ tically .
They wouldn 't do that , not among my d@@ r@@ e@@ aming s@@ p@@ ires .
Even my Communist friends always had imp@@ e@@ c@@ cable manners .
His r@@ h@@ e@@ u@@ m@@ y eyes began to cl@@ oud .
Give it a chance .
I 'm sure it 's all just a t@@ e@@ ase .
It would break my heart if you left .
E@@ x@@ hau@@ sted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional resistance was deterior@@ ating .
A male friend of mine , also a Tory supporter , had succumbed to pressure and r@@ e@@ n@@ o@@ unced his creed .
During a tut@@ orial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seriousness , that I was an " enemy of the people , " I decided to do the same .
I@@ n@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ dly b@@ l@@ ush@@ ing with shame , I admitted to being " bra@@ i@@ n@@ washed by my parents " and called them " old fools . "
The resp@@ ite was short .
It was my father who drove the n@@ ail into the coff@@ in of my Oxford career .
At the time , he wrote two colum@@ ns in the Murdoch press each week .
My door was locked .
I c@@ o@@ w@@ e@@ r@@ ed inside , and after five minutes , my pursu@@ ers gave up .
When they left , I packed a s@@ u@@ i@@ t@@ case and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
You may call me a sn@@ i@@ v@@ elling wim@@ p .
But no 18-year-old should be subject to such intimid@@ ation and vit@@ r@@ i@@ ol in an educational institution .
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers , but , to this day , hi@@ des behind an ill-@@ deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
" Valent@@ ino prefers e@@ l@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ ce to notor@@ i@@ e@@ ty "
On the occasion of the " Valent@@ ino : Master of Cout@@ ure , " an exhibition that opened this week in London , ABC speaks with N@@ a@@ t@@ y A@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ cal , F@@ ion@@ a T@@ h@@ ys@@ sen-@@ Bor@@ n@@ e@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ za and other of the Italian designer 's famous clients .
Somer@@ set House , former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England , is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valent@@ ino Gar@@ a@@ v@@ ani exhibition .
During the inaugur@@ ation of " Valent@@ ino : Master of Cout@@ ure , " the designer acknowledged a retro@@ spec@@ tive a@@ pothe@@ o@@ sis that brings together over 130 c@@ out@@ ure gowns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years .
" I love this pal@@ ace " he says , in his u@@ n@@ mist@@ a@@ k@@ able Italian accent .
This exhibition is the cul@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ ation of a story whose only p@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ a@@ g@@ o@@ n@@ ist is " sign@@ ore " Gar@@ a@@ v@@ ani , although it could not have been written without his disting@@ uished clients .
Valent@@ ino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the n@@ o@@ bility .
In the first room of the exhibition , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of arist@@ oc@@ r@@ a@@ cy , from Princess Sal@@ i@@ m@@ ah A@@ ga Khan , Lord Sno@@ w@@ don , Princess M@@ a@@ r@@ ie-@@ C@@ h@@ ant@@ al of Gre@@ ece to Margaret of England .
Valent@@ ino exhib@@ its these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social a@@ s@@ cent from hum@@ ble cou@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ier in Vo@@ g@@ h@@ era , northern Italy , to ido@@ l of the international jet-@@ set .
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty .
" At least they don 't drop cigarette ends on your magn@@ ific@@ ent car@@ pet , like some beautiful pop music celebr@@ ities do , " says Bar@@ o@@ n@@ ess F@@ ion@@ a T@@ h@@ ys@@ sen-@@ Bor@@ n@@ e@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ za .
In the ' 60s and ' 70s , we both lived in the A@@ l@@ ps and were good friends .
Valent@@ ino is a spectac@@ ular host whose enter@@ t@@ a@@ ins with gener@@ osity and e@@ l@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ ce .
" We all loved being invited to his chal@@ et in G@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ ad " says " Hein@@ i " T@@ h@@ ys@@ sen 's ex-wife , a close friend of forgotten beau@@ ties such as Mare@@ l@@ la A@@ g@@ n@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ i and Eu@@ genie Ni@@ arch@@ os .
Valent@@ ino has always preferred e@@ l@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ ce to notor@@ i@@ e@@ ty .
And yet , he is a star .
Val@@ eria Ma@@ z@@ za , wearing a Valent@@ ino .
The Argent@@ ine model Val@@ eria Ma@@ z@@ za also recalls the cou@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ier 's charis@@ ma .
Many years ago , after a fashion show in Pi@@ azza di S@@ p@@ a@@ g@@ na in Rome , we went for dinner at his flat .
There were twenty of us , including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr .
You could see and feel his " spirit " in every detail of the flat and its dec@@ or , the food and the music .
" All the guests were made to feel important and loved " recalls the top model , who started working with him during Haute Cout@@ ure Week Paris , in 1995 .
" His designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion " she conclu@@ des .
N@@ o@@ bility parade
Gar@@ a@@ v@@ ani 's life is not a story of obsession , but of well r@@ e@@ c@@ i@@ proc@@ ated love .
He loves well-@@ educated people who come from good backgrounds , and they love him .
One of the Somer@@ set House galler@@ ies has been transformed into a glam@@ orous , six@@ ty-@@ foot long cat@@ walk which offers a role rever@@ sal : visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the cat@@ walk while looking at a dream " audience " wearing Valent@@ ino m@@ a@@ ster@@ pieces , for example , the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Ari@@ sto@@ tle On@@ assi@@ s , the costume Monica V@@ i@@ t@@ ti wore in " La N@@ o@@ tte " and the w@@ o@@ o@@ l and l@@ e@@ a@@ ther coat that belon@@ ged to Em@@ press Far@@ ah D@@ i@@ ba .
In this crowd of m@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ q@@ u@@ ins , names stand out such as Si@@ b@@ illa of Luxem@@ bourg , Gl@@ oria von T@@ h@@ u@@ r@@ n und Ta@@ xis , Met@@ te-@@ M@@ a@@ r@@ it of Norway , Ros@@ a@@ r@@ io of Bulgaria and Sofia of Hab@@ sburg .
N@@ a@@ t@@ y A@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ cal and the designer , in 2006
Many of these clients say your first Valent@@ ino is like your first love , " impossible to forget . "
I remember it perfectly .
It was a pair of trousers , a shirt , a " g@@ i@@ l@@ et " wa@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ coat and jacket from the 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1-@@ 1972 autum@@ n-@@ winter collection .
" It was a gift he gave me " says N@@ a@@ t@@ y A@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ cal , one of the designer 's mus@@ es .
" I prefer him to other desig@@ ners because of his femin@@ i@@ n@@ ity , his great love of women , and because he enhan@@ ces our beauty " added the former Duchess of Fer@@ ia .
I love the colo@@ urs he uses , they really stand out and " lend themselves " to your face .
Their p@@ r@@ o@@ portions are perfect .
The pr@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ ess and fashion advis@@ or Patri@@ cia della Gio@@ v@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ ola d '@@ A@@ r@@ enberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valent@@ ino .
As a teenager living in Italy , I dreamed of reaching the age when I 'd have the chance to wear one of his evening gowns ...
My time finally came in the late ' 90s .
I bought my first Valent@@ ino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cousin , Prince Ed@@ o@@ u@@ ard de Lig@@ ne .
It was a red dress , with a fr@@ i@@ l@@ ly s@@ k@@ i@@ r@@ t , draped " cor@@ sage " and a stra@@ p@@ l@@ ess neck@@ line .
" It was a dream come true " says Princess D '@@ A@@ r@@ enberg , the w@@ i@@ dow of R@@ o@@ dri@@ go d '@@ A@@ r@@ enberg .
" Valent@@ ino is i@@ n@@ different to fashion , his obsession is tim@@ eless " says this Italian arist@@ oc@@ rat who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
Princess D '@@ A@@ r@@ enberg looks after her cou@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ier gowns with " the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress , it 's also the many memories that go with it . "
The " king " of fashion
The " grand finale " of the Somer@@ set House exhibition is M@@ a@@ r@@ ie-@@ C@@ h@@ ant@@ al Miller 's wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Gre@@ ece in 1995 .
It took four months ' work and 25 " girls " ( as the designer calls his seam@@ stres@@ ses ) to create the p@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ l-@@ e@@ n@@ cru@@ sted , i@@ v@@ o@@ r@@ y-@@ coloured silk gown with t@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ ve different types of l@@ ace and a train four and a half metres long .
According to journalist Su@@ zy Men@@ kes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century , " the return of high society clients . "
Da@@ z@@ z@@ led for years with the " s@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ ir-@@ ê@@ t@@ r@@ e " of the elite , Valent@@ ino is now its finest e@@ x@@ p@@ onent .
Cav@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ ere di Gr@@ an Cro@@ ce ( the highest-ranking distinction in Italy ) , Cav@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ ere del Lav@@ oro , C@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ ur de L 'Or@@ dre des Arts et des L@@ ett@@ res , and awarded the Legion of Hon@@ our , Gar@@ a@@ v@@ ani accumul@@ ates as many honours as any of his clients ' h@@ u@@ s@@ bands .
" I 've always been struck by his refin@@ ed and calm manner , and his neat and perfect appearance " acknowledges D '@@ A@@ r@@ enberg .
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Or@@ say Museum .
He was on the table of Coun@@ t@@ ess Jacqu@@ eline de Ri@@ bes , a great friend of mine .
" He was imm@@ a@@ c@@ ulate , time stands still for him . "
If a pr@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ ess says that ...
The hardest job in the world : the human mul@@ es of Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen
For four euros , the Indonesian vol@@ can@@ o porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kil@@ os of sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur along steep stone paths .
There are people for whom work is hell , and others who - lit@@ e@@ r@@ ally - work in hell .
This is the case of A@@ n@@ to Wi@@ j@@ a@@ y@@ a , one of the 400 miners who make their living taking sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur from the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen vol@@ can@@ o , east of the Indonesian island of Jav@@ a .
To do so , he has to desc@@ end every day to the bottom of the crater , where the sul@@ p@@ h@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ us gas emanating from the bow@@ els of the earth solidi@@ f@@ i@@ es on contact with air .
After breaking off large sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur rocks , which in total can weigh up to 70 kil@@ os , he carries them in two b@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ o@@ o bas@@ kets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths .
It is only 250 metres to the top of the vol@@ can@@ o , which rises to 2@@ ,@@ 38@@ 6 metres above sea level , but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there , at sn@@ ail 's pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid sli@@ pping and falling over the precip@@ ice .
They know that one slip could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourist who plung@@ ed to her death a few years ago on the h@@ a@@ z@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ ous Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen cli@@ ffs .
The Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen miners are paid 5 euro cents for each kil@@ o of sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur removed .
Once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like cir@@ cus monkeys and then , l@@ u@@ gging their heavy bas@@ kets , they walk three kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res to the s@@ c@@ ales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,8@@ 50 metres above sea level .
This is PT N@@ gri@@ mb@@ i Cand@@ i , a company which , since 1@@ 9@@ 60 , has been explo@@ iting the vol@@ can@@ o , and quite lit@@ e@@ r@@ ally its workers , whom it pays 6@@ 62 rupees ( 5 euro cents ) per kil@@ o of sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur .
It then sells the sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur for 10,000 rupees ( 83 cents ) to the pet@@ rochemical industry , as the m@@ i@@ n@@ eral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufac@@ ture of matches , fireworks , cosme@@ tics , d@@ yn@@ a@@ m@@ ite and even for w@@ h@@ i@@ t@@ ening sugar .
" We generally carry 70 kil@@ os , so we get about 46,000 rupees ( 3.@@ 8 euros ) a trip " explains A@@ n@@ to , who usually make three trips a day .
Each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted , but it means he gets 13@@ 8,000 rupees ( 11.@@ 5 euros ) at the end of the day .
Although it seems a pit@@ tance for such an i@@ n@@ human effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field .
" Miners ' wages are very high here , wher@@ e@@ as coffee harvest@@ ing is paid 15,000 rupees ( 1.2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees ( 16@@ 7 euros ) " explains the p@@ o@@ r@@ ter , who previously worked as a m@@ a@@ s@@ on in the island resort of Bali .
There , his wage was 75,000 rupees ( 6.@@ 2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , but A@@ n@@ to has returned with his family to B@@ any@@ u@@ w@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ i , a village near the vol@@ can@@ o , for a compelling reason which , in Indonesia , is as over@@ riding as the sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur : " I married a girl from Bali , where they are Hindu , and I 've brought her to Jav@@ a to convert to Islam . "
A@@ n@@ to has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , cou@@ ghs const@@ antly and his eyes are i@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ ated by the toxic gases .
At 27 years old , A@@ n@@ to has been risking his life for three years in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen vol@@ can@@ o , and the sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mas@@ k and g@@ o@@ gg@@ les .
He has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , cou@@ ghs const@@ antly and his eyes are i@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ ated by the toxic gases from the vol@@ can@@ o .
This is the price you have to pay to real@@ ise your dreams .
" I 'll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French " he v@@ o@@ w@@ s in more than acceptable English .
Pun@@ ished for life , this pleas@@ ant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , wa@@ iter or hotel recep@@ tion@@ ist , but instead he does the work of a m@@ u@@ le .
Shar@@ ing a filthy wooden hut with other porters , he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur doesn 't stop flowing at night , when its character@@ istic yellow colour turns blue and it g@@ lows in the dark .
D@@ e@@ fying the shadows , A@@ n@@ to desc@@ ends the crater and lights the path with a small tor@@ ch attached to the h@@ e@@ l@@ met he bought with his money .
Some 400 porters carry sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur bas@@ kets on their shoulders from the crater .
Despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechan@@ ised the sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur extra@@ ction process to save costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the porters , who work for themselves and by the kil@@ o .
In fact , they do not even see any of the 30,000 r@@ u@@ p@@ e@@ e ( 2.5 euro ) per camera s@@ u@@ r@@ charge that , on top of the 15,000 r@@ u@@ p@@ e@@ e ( 1.2 euro ) entrance fee , the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the vol@@ can@@ o and their human mul@@ es .
" This work is for animals , not people " protests Mad@@ rus@@ in , a b@@ u@@ r@@ ly 4@@ 2-@@ year p@@ o@@ r@@ ter who has been working at Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen for three decades , since leaving school .
He can lift up to 110 kil@@ os , ensuring that he will go on working " all he can " because he needs the money to educate his three children , aged between 18 [ months ? ] and 10 years old .
I won 't retire , I 'll die here because the vol@@ can@@ o has been my whole life .
Although the sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur burns your thro@@ at and s@@ t@@ ings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and t@@ r@@ a@@ ps the miners in the thick colum@@ ns of smoke coming out of the vol@@ can@@ o , they are so h@@ a@@ r@@ dy that no-@@ one complain@@ s of serious illnesses ... apart , of course , from their common resp@@ i@@ r@@ atory problems , o@@ ste@@ o@@ arth@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ is , knee pain and s@@ o@@ res on the shoulders , which have been m@@ i@@ s@@ sha@@ pen by the weight of the bas@@ kets .
Bal@@ anc@@ ing the bas@@ ket on his back , U@@ n@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ik can only carry 50 kil@@ os now he is 53 years old .
Every day , he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur from the vol@@ can@@ o , which three l@@ o@@ r@@ ries move to the warehouse in Tam@@ ans@@ ari , 18 kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res away along a g@@ o@@ at path that passes through scrub@@ land .
" I won 't retire , I 'll die here because the vol@@ can@@ o has been my whole life " says U@@ n@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ik , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be .
The oldest of his five children , 30 years old , also works carrying sul@@ p@@ h@@ ur .
Time passes , but poverty p@@ e@@ r@@ pet@@ u@@ ates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world : the one done by human mul@@ es in the Ka@@ wa@@ h I@@ jen vol@@ can@@ o .
Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Sing@@ a@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ ans blame their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children .
" Singapore 's population needs to grow . "
I 'm a p@@ atri@@ otic husband , you 're my p@@ atri@@ otic wife , let 's do our c@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ c duty and create life !
It may seem unlikely that these v@@ e@@ r@@ ses are part of an advert for m@@ i@@ n@@ t swe@@ ets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year .
The p@@ h@@ r@@ ases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as " Let 's put a b@@ ao ( b@@ u@@ n ) in the oven " to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore .
The advertising company that made the video , BB@@ H , is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
Its creative director , Douglas Hamilton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their " national duty . "
It 's pu@@ rely an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and a@@ m@@ using .
It 's the biggest problem facing this country .
We are the world 's worst at r@@ e@@ producing our own progen@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
We knew the Government had tried many things , like launching p@@ e@@ r@@ f@@ u@@ m@@ es with pher@@ o@@ m@@ ones or organis@@ ing speed dating e@@ v@@ enings .
Many of these ideas may have been creative , but they didn 't necessarily work .
So we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by compos@@ ing a rap ?
1.2 children
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so ligh@@ tly .
It spends U@@ S@@ D 1,300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to U@@ S@@ D 15,000 per child , extends m@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ ity leave and d@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ b@@ utes tax benefits .
But this has all had little effect .
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in Southeast Asia , also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls .
The birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
The last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
So why are Sing@@ a@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ ans not having children ?
T@@ an We@@ i Ming , Director of M@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ age and Family Policy of the National Population Division , said that it is a result of " better education " and " a wider range of career opportunities . "
" This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family " he explains .
These changes in social nor@@ ms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and bir@@ ths , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
Meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population .
In Singapore , there are websites where x@@ e@@ n@@ o@@ p@@ h@@ o@@ bia against many new immigrants is widespread and thin@@ ly disgu@@ ised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
Incre@@ ased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and l@@ e@@ v@@ i@@ es for foreign workers .
Une@@ x@@ p@@ ected consequences
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation 's economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Singapore 's case there are also some unexpected consequences .
The Government is trying not to build so many small houses .
For example , it has started to influence the real estate sector .
Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small a@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ m@@ ents , known as " shoe boxes , " which can be built in certain areas of the city .
These a@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ m@@ ents have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales .
However , there is concern that they may promote a single-@@ living lifestyle and discour@@ age developers who want to build large family houses .
But , L@@ im Ye@@ w Soon , managing director of the real estate company E@@ L Develop@@ ers , says his " shoe boxes " sell much faster than larger units .
They are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
This means they are much better for our cash flow .
However , he admits that the new regulations give cle@@ arer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
Too stressed
Singapore is a city State .
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Sing@@ a@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ ans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact .
" People are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family " says a young executive .
Other people can have children .
" But , for me , it is important to have my own money and time " says another young man of around 20 years old .
Men and women alike mention their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
So , much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to babies , the Sing@@ a@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ ans have the last word .
What is private o@@ f@@ f@@ line is private online
Priv@@ acy .
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dic@@ tion@@ ary , it means the quality of private life or " the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . "
What is privacy for an under 16 ?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share o@@ f@@ f@@ line ?
El@@ Peri@@ ó@@ dic@@ o interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users .
In four cases , they associated the term with " something very much mine " on a personal level , and " in the user name and p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ word " when applied to social networks .
" I wouldn 't up@@ load my deep@@ est secrets in a post " says Jorge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook , Twit@@ ter , Hotmail and Windows Live Messen@@ ger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
" They are very secret secrets , I 'll tell my mother , but not everybody " he says .
On F@@ B I up@@ load nice pictures or games .
And I have fun with people I know .
" I wouldn 't share a photo that isn 't mine , or that belongs to somebody who 's doing something stupid " he says .
The child recogn@@ ises that it is bad to post o@@ b@@ scene pictures of naked people , crimes , or write hum@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ating or aggressive comments .
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine followers on Twit@@ ter .
Most are relatives .
His mother is included , and she has the p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ word to one of the accounts .
I opened Twit@@ ter to express myself and post interesting t@@ w@@ e@@ ets .
" I don 't know if they answer me , I only up@@ load them " he adds .
" Social networking is fun , I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends " he says .
He does not hes@@ itate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
Nor would he take any notice of someone who recommen@@ ds a stran@@ ger to him .
The case of Joseph , aged 14 , is different .
This teenager has accounts with Hotmail , Facebook , My Space and Ask , and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
" It doesn 't bother me , because we have something in common , like music " he says .
The boy says that no-@@ one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
" If they pressured me or asked me for it , I 'd just del@@ ete them from my account " he states .
Joseph became a follow@@ er on Ask , after reading a recommen@@ dation on Twit@@ ter .
This teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cy@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ bullying .
An acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ tance of a friend of mine was being p@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ered on a social network .
They were threatening him and demanding money from him .
" I never found out who it was " he says .
The victim , according to José , did not close his account .
" He just made it private . "
He then explains a series of steps to c@@ o@@ n@@ figure the account safely .
Unlike Jorge , this boy would up@@ load photos of acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ tan@@ ces in uncomfortable or embarr@@ assing situations .
I would do it if I didn 't like somebody , or they made me want to do it .
" However , I know that 's cy@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ bullying " he admits .
Key questions
M@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ l@@ os Por@@ ras , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and teenagers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
" The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed " he says .
Por@@ ras says the schol@@ ar Marc P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ sky , with a Master 's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital N@@ atives , Digital Im@@ mig@@ rants , c@@ o@@ ined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
Digital n@@ atives are those children and young people born with technology .
" We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning " he says .
He says that the issue is complex , " because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disc@@ lose , publish or d@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ l@@ ge , at an age at which matur@@ ity is not condu@@ cive to this . "
" They also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences " he adds .
According to the specialist , the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
" T@@ elling them not to do it is no good " he adds .
Por@@ ras then lists some options : There are things you wouldn 't tell a stran@@ ger , so why do it online ?
Or , would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend ?
Do you know what others publish about you ?
When t@@ a@@ g@@ ging party photos , did you ask the other people 's permission to tag them ?
And one more question : does everyone need to know what you 're doing all the time ?
Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do o@@ f@@ f@@ line .
The rules are the same .
" Outside the Internet , people act with respect , mor@@ ality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks " he says .
Monitoring
Stuart Guard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consultant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks ' policies thor@@ o@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ly .
By understanding all the cl@@ auses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account .
" For example , the age at which you are allowed to share or publish " he says .
According to Guar@@ dia , it is important to remind children the " don 't talk to stran@@ gers " lesson .
U@@ n@@ a@@ s@@ ur Summit clos@@ es without making public the Lima Dec@@ lar@@ ation
The Six@@ th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( U@@ n@@ a@@ s@@ ur ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Dec@@ lar@@ ation , previously announced and theo@@ reti@@ cally signed by the seven atten@@ d@@ e@@ e leaders .
E@@ fe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Six@@ th UN@@ AS@@ U@@ R Meeting of Heads of State and Government , but Presidential and C@@ h@@ anc@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peru@@ vian Government website .
When asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peru@@ vian President , Ol@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ ta Hum@@ ala , during a brief statement to the press .
Jo@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ a@@ l@@ ists ' access to information from the Summit was restri@@ cted at all times .
During the summit , in the press room , only video was aired , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message " closed session , audio restri@@ cted . "
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spok@@ e@@ s@@ men of some of the UN@@ AS@@ U@@ R governments attending the meeting , but not the Peru@@ vian Government .
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents , which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details .
The Peru@@ vian President then sent an email to the media with the " final statement " of the summit , but this was Hum@@ ala 's statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
Last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American-@@ Arab Coun@@ tries ( A@@ S@@ P@@ A ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lima Dec@@ lar@@ ation was again not made public .
The A@@ S@@ P@@ A official website confir@@ ms that the document was published last Tuesday .
At both international events , the Peru@@ vian authorities were at pain@@ s to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the o@@ b@@ taining of information to a maximum .
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the H@@ ague Court to a@@ d@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate a border dispute between the two countries .
The Presidents of Peru , Ol@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ ta Hum@@ ala , and Chile , S@@ e@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ á@@ n Pi@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The H@@ ague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago .
" We will o@@ b@@ e@@ y and exec@@ ute the order that currently defin@@ es the differences we are bringing before this international court " said Hum@@ ala , together with his Chilean counterpart .
" Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disp@@ utes , t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ es and international courts " added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , gre@@ eting Hum@@ ala with a hand@@ shake , alongside the flags of the two countries .
Confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week denounced the B@@ o@@ g@@ o@@ t@@ á P@@ act , wher@@ e@@ by it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its mar@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ e boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed .
The summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , D@@ i@@ l@@ ma Rous@@ s@@ e@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hugo Chavez ; Bolivia , E@@ vo Morales ; and Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
P@@ a@@ r@@ agu@@ ay , which was suspended by UN@@ AS@@ U@@ R in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lu@@ go , was not involved in the meeting .
Host President Ol@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ ta Hum@@ ala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in Lima .
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
Among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that UN@@ AS@@ U@@ R countries will take " important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . "
He reported that actions are being implemented to improve " cooperation in the fight against i@@ n@@ security and trans@@ national organ@@ ised crime , actions to make medic@@ ation more accessible , low-cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal join@@ tly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . "
With Europe in crisis , " economic consoli@@ dation ( in Latin America ) should not have a t@@ r@@ i@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ ist attitude but should serve to expand its productive m@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ x and glimpse a better future for its people " Hum@@ ala added .
" We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in rural and border areas ... u@@ n@@ iting our countries and creating new economic networks " said the Peru@@ vian President in a message read out .
Among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the trans@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ se a@@ xes of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador , although he gave no further details .
Also , the final document mentioned the political situation in P@@ a@@ r@@ agu@@ ay .
" We hope the electoral process in that country serves to r@@ e@@ incorpor@@ ate it in the Union of South American Nations , " from which it is currently excluded .
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ bour@@ ly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit .
In this sense , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel San@@ tos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua , Daniel Or@@ t@@ e@@ ga , on Saturday in Mexico , to respec@@ t@@ fully discuss the mar@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ e dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J , questioned by Bogota .
" The day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Or@@ t@@ e@@ ga " San@@ tos said .
" We will review all these paths , [ which ] are not exclusive , and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua " he emph@@ a@@ s@@ ised .
" With President Or@@ t@@ e@@ ga , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most c@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ l@@ ised and respec@@ tful manner possible " said San@@ tos .
San@@ tos and Or@@ t@@ e@@ ga are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inaugur@@ ation of the country 's new President , E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que Pe@@ ñ@@ a Nie@@ to .
Also , as part of the summit , the bloc 's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 20@@ 13 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , U@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ u@@ ay , Venezuela , Chile , Gu@@ y@@ ana , Sur@@ i@@ n@@ am and P@@ a@@ r@@ agu@@ ay make up UN@@ AS@@ U@@ R , although the latter is currently suspended .
Peru has the pro t@@ e@@ m@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e presidency of the regional bloc .
" South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship " says Rafael Cor@@ rea
The President of Ecuador , Rafael Cor@@ rea , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that " South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . "
Cor@@ rea , who took part in the Ele@@ vent@@ h Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ U@@ R ) held in Lima , told Peru 's state television that Euro@@ p@@ e@@ ans " killed one another in the Second World War " and other conflicts , " but are now practi@@ cally one country . "
To this end , he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UN@@ AS@@ U@@ R .
" We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the A@@ n@@ dean Community . However , there are still r@@ e@@ action@@ ary sectors that want us to return to the past " he said .
The E@@ cu@@ ador@@ ian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( O@@ AS ) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Ang@@ l@@ o@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon states and taking into account those who have signed the P@@ act of San José on human rights .
Those who speak with authority never commit to anything , wher@@ e@@ as we South Americans sign everything .
" It is i@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ hen@@ sible that the I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ -@@ American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding " he said referring to Ecuador giving political asyl@@ um to W@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ L@@ e@@ aks founder Juli@@ an As@@ s@@ a@@ n@@ ge .
Cor@@ rea said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betra@@ yed his principles , but has respected his " deep democratic and human rights values . "
He added that , at the time , " he had reasonable suspicion that As@@ s@@ a@@ n@@ ge would be extra@@ d@@ ited to another country and that his case would not be respected . "
Additionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country , when " Swedish legislation itself dict@@ ates that he can be questioned via vide@@ o@@ conference , which could be done from the E@@ cu@@ ador@@ ian Embassy in London . "
Cor@@ rea said that there is a risk of deterior@@ ation of As@@ s@@ a@@ n@@ ge 's physical and mental health .
" I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious " said the E@@ cu@@ ador@@ ian President .
What there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deterior@@ ate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise .
" That would complic@@ ate the health of any person " he added .
Cor@@ rea said that the solution to the asyl@@ um granted to As@@ s@@ a@@ n@@ ge in June by the E@@ cu@@ ador@@ ian Embassy , in London , through the issue of a s@@ a@@ f@@ e@@ -@@ conduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the impris@@ onment of the W@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ L@@ e@@ aks founder .
We do not negoti@@ ate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions .
" The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because As@@ s@@ a@@ n@@ ge 's lawyer , Bal@@ t@@ a@@ z@@ ar Gar@@ z@@ on , is handling a series of cases in different European courts " he said .
And he felt that " if Britain says no to the s@@ a@@ f@@ e@@ -@@ conduct pass , it 's over . "
And if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr As@@ s@@ a@@ n@@ ge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London , or i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ r@@ o@@ gates him via Skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
Cor@@ rea took the opportunity to reasser@@ t himself as a defen@@ der of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tol@@ erate is " the medi@@ oc@@ r@@ ity , dish@@ onesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . "
" The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evi@@ l and w@@ icked politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , black@@ mail and extortion " he said .
In that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , " or the bankers or bour@@ g@@ e@@ ois and hege@@ monic countries that domin@@ ate Ecuador " and said that , if re-@@ elected , he will " step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . "
Cor@@ rea also supported the decision to maintain the veto on P@@ a@@ r@@ agu@@ ay in UN@@ AS@@ U@@ R , at least until their next elections , arguing that the body " must be firm and not tol@@ erate opportun@@ ism and a coup masked with leg@@ ality " because this will in fact " destroy the legitim@@ acy of P@@ a@@ r@@ agu@@ a@@ y@@ an democracy . "
The E@@ cu@@ ador@@ ian President also considered the " perfectly p@@ e@@ r@@ tin@@ ent " desire of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel San@@ tos , to now negoti@@ ate with Nicaragua the mar@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ e boundary between the two countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The H@@ ague , in favour Nic@@ a@@ r@@ agu@@ an mar@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ e sovereign@@ ty .
For now that ruling is not being followed .
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one .
Conflict is inevitable , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
They need to be proc@@ essed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward .
Additionally , he trusted in a sound conclusion to the mar@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ e boundary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that " it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . "
With reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador seeking a third consecutive term , he said he sees that possibility " with much optimism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . "
Cor@@ rea said that if he loses the elections in February 20@@ 13 , he will retire from public life .
Per@@ s@@ o@@ n@@ ally , I 've never been interested in power , but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador , soci@@ o-@@ economic poverty can only be cor@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ ted by political power .
" My political movement believed that it was me who ensu@@ red that prob@@ able victory , so we have to accept that responsibility " he said .
If I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life .
If I lose , l@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ wise .
" It 's a decision " he confirmed .
Cor@@ rea also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 's new health treatment in Cuba .
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nic@@ o@@ l@@ á@@ s Mad@@ u@@ r@@ o and he tells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba .
" This does not mean a health rel@@ apse for President Chavez " he said .
In Lima today , the E@@ cu@@ ador@@ ian Head of State attended the Six@@ th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ AS@@ U@@ R ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to susta@@ in progress , equality and security .
Deaths caused by AIDS are n@@ o@@ w@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s due to late d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ction
F@@ abri@@ zi@@ o was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive .
" It was like a bomb dropped on me " he says , recalling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make " sof@@ ter , " apparently u@@ n@@ successfully .
The boy hid it from his family .
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 43@@ rd birthday .
He is u@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ u@@ b@@ tedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Gu@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ l@@ aj@@ ara Civil Hospital ( CH@@ G ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several batt@@ les with his health .
F@@ abri@@ zi@@ o has lived with the human immun@@ o@@ def@@ iciency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early ' 90s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of stig@@ ma .
Then , even the director of an I@@ MS@@ S [ Mex@@ ican Social Security Institute ] clinic refused to dischar@@ ge him " because he had a cut . "
At that time , having Aids was s@@ y@@ non@@ y@@ m@@ ous with death .
Now it is possible to survive the syn@@ drome and do so with quality of life .
However , many people are still u@@ n@@ aware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc , " exhausted " their imm@@ une systems and they are suffering from opportun@@ istic infections .
31 years after of the o@@ n@@ set of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , " the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equ@@ al " stated the head of the CH@@ G HIV Unit , J@@ aim@@ e A@@ n@@ dra@@ de Vill@@ a@@ n@@ u@@ e@@ v@@ a , saying that this information was endor@@ sed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal .
Inf@@ ectious disease specialist and expert in HIV / AIDS , A@@ n@@ dra@@ de Vill@@ a@@ n@@ u@@ e@@ v@@ a said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life expectancy and quality of life dep@@ end on the degree of damage to the imm@@ une system that patients present when they are diagno@@ sed , with a higher life expectancy for non-@@ drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 count .
In simple terms , this means that anyone diagno@@ sed HIV positive at 25 years old , under these terms and " as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 " said the intervie@@ w@@ e@@ e .
To gauge this progress , it should be remember@@ ed that the average life expectancy of Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans today is 76 years .
Although mor@@ tal@@ ity has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,@@ 6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4,8@@ 62 in 2011 ( UN@@ AIDS annual report ) , it is also true that since the adv@@ ent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
In J@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ co alone , only 25@@ 5 people died in 2011 , and there have been 18@@ 7 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs since 2005 .
- Why are do still deaths occur ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment .
That 's how I view it , and that 's how it 's been at our hospital .
For at least the last 12 years we 've had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are u@@ n@@ aware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
He gave a compelling statist@@ ic : " Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportun@@ istic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mor@@ tal@@ ity is to make earlier diagno@@ ses and , therefore , offer mass d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ction tests for everyone who needs them . "
Spec@@ ialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in J@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ co ( CO@@ E@@ S@@ ID@@ A ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as F@@ abri@@ zi@@ o , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Ka@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ i sar@@ coma , a can@@ cer@@ ous tum@@ our that is one of the common complications .
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
Some people think they 're going to die and don 't want to know anything .
" If I 'm going to die , I 'd rather have a b@@ low-@@ out three times a week " they say , but not in my case .
The change was for the better ; I eat well , I exercise , I take my drugs .
To date , his parents are only aware he had cancer .
I live as normal a life as anyone else .
" I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person " said F@@ abri@@ zi@@ o , who agreed to share his intim@@ ate secrets with MIL@@ EN@@ IO J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO , to motiv@@ ate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
They should get tested if they are at r@@ i@@ s@@ k@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagno@@ sed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being responsible .
This is his message , which summar@@ ises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
C@@ o@@ n@@ dom@@ s behind the counter .
The gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ric@@ ardo Sal@@ az@@ ar , a journalist from Gu@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ l@@ aj@@ ara who has taken up the HIV cause .
And the greatest cure is prevention .
In places dedicated to this task " the distribution of condoms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us pack@@ ets of a hundred , and that 's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms " he said .
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers .
" Why do you want them ? " is a common question , asked with sar@@ cas@@ m and judged according to the values of social workers , counsell@@ ors , p@@ h@@ arm@@ acy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex , said the speaker .
It was decided to change such i@@ n@@ efficient allocation , and that condoms should not only be placed behind counters , but that pack@@ ets of one hundred should be found in public toilet disp@@ ens@@ ers in places frequ@@ ented by young people .
This is not promoting p@@ r@@ o@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ cu@@ ity .
It is not about paying for their b@@ e@@ ers or m@@ o@@ t@@ e@@ l fees , as Governor Em@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ o Gonzalez said , when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration .
" And it 's not about sexu@@ ality , but it is best to provide condoms to those already pra@@ c@@ t@@ ising sexual activity " he said .
J@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ co key points
There are 13,@@ 4@@ 35 cum@@ ulative cases ( 12,@@ 15@@ 8 AIDS and 1,3@@ 17 HIV ) .
The state is 4th in the nation in new and cum@@ ulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV .
92 % of new infections are through sex , 6 % via the bloo@@ d@@ stream and 2 % p@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ a@@ t@@ al .
An estimated 50,000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4-@@ 5 people who do not know they are positive .
R@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ fied by a United States court of appeal , a judgement which igno@@ res the restructuring of the V@@ i@@ t@@ ro Group 's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico , the scenario is an o@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ ous preced@@ ent for any national company with offices in the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ bouring country that has s@@ o@@ l@@ ven@@ cy problems .
It seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mex@@ ican law are not val@@ id in the land of stars and stripes , contr@@ ary to international conventions .
In practical terms , the endor@@ sement of the judgement delivered on 15 June by Judge Har@@ lin Hale of the Bank@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ cy Court of the Northern District of Texas , leaves Mex@@ ican firms defen@@ cel@@ ess against possible sei@@ z@@ ure of their property outside of Mexico .
However , the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , claiming three i@@ n@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies .
From the start , while the trial judge notes that credit@@ ors should be g@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ ed by the United States Bank@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ cy C@@ o@@ de , the Court of Ap@@ p@@ e@@ al for the Fif@@ th Circuit , based in New Orleans , states that the main action is the i@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ ven@@ cy action handled in Mexico .
The first point would involve ignoring international proc@@ e@@ d@@ u@@ r@@ al cooperation in cases of i@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ ven@@ cy of companies with trans@@ national prof@@ iles .
Indeed , the UN M@@ o@@ del Law for International Trade Law U@@ n@@ i@@ formity was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute position@@ ed as a@@ r@@ bit@@ rator .
Se@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ dly , the judgement e@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ b@@ l@@ ishes that without the i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ company vote , with the debts the V@@ i@@ t@@ ro subsidiaries had with their parent company recogn@@ ised in the critical mass of the i@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ ven@@ cy , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
However , Mex@@ ican law recogn@@ ises the possibility .
In fact , the V@@ i@@ t@@ ro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted .
There are half a dozen examples , including Agre@@ m@@ e@@ x and Commercial Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ana , whose i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ company debts were endor@@ sed by the Federal Bank@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ cy Institute .
What is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the V@@ i@@ t@@ ro credit@@ ors who fought against it in the US courts , nam@@ ely " v@@ u@@ l@@ ture " funds such as A@@ u@@ reli@@ os Capital , A@@ u@@ reli@@ os C@@ o@@ n@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ gence , Elli@@ ot International and Liverpool Limited , did not achieve a majority .
The vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37 .
This data is o@@ m@@ itted by the Court of Ap@@ p@@ e@@ al .
From another perspective , the latter blames V@@ i@@ t@@ ro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country .
For now , the Gonzalez S@@ a@@ d@@ a family firm has lodged a motion for r@@ e@@ consideration before the Court of Ap@@ p@@ e@@ al for the vote to reach the p@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ ary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously .
Should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the US Supreme Court , will be filed .
The real problem is that the court byp@@ assed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of a@@ m@@ icus c@@ u@@ r@@ i@@ ae ( " friend of the Court " ) , which details the procedure followed by V@@ i@@ t@@ ro under the framework of the Commercial I@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ ven@@ cy Law , noting that the latter dischar@@ ged itself with adher@@ ence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chap@@ ter 15 of the Bank@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ cy Act of the United States .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , it should be noted that the country y@@ i@@ e@@ l@@ ded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade , that is the rules set for cross-@@ border i@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ ven@@ cy cases , ensuring fair@@ ness for deb@@ tors and credit@@ ors .
Dou@@ ble w@@ h@@ a@@ m@@ my : V@@ i@@ t@@ ro hit and country hit .

With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ana Airlines against the former owner of the company , Gast@@ ón Az@@ c@@ á@@ r@@ r@@ a@@ ga A@@ n@@ dra@@ de , who is accused of m@@ i@@ s@@ management , dor@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ t for several months , the Air@@ line P@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ ts Union Association already found the bott@@ len@@ eck .
The proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Mor@@ ine@@ au has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Ban@@ king and Securities Commission , which is accused of o@@ b@@ struc@@ ting justice .
The claim is that the super@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ ory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Attorney General 's Office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million p@@ e@@ s@@ os from trust F / 58@@ 9 of Banc@@ o I@@ X@@ E , on behalf of Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ana de A@@ v@@ i@@ a@@ c@@ i@@ ón .
The resources were apparently c@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ elled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administ@@ r@@ a@@ dor@@ a Prof@@ e@@ s@@ i@@ onal de H@@ o@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ es .
As you know , Az@@ car@@ r@@ a@@ ga A@@ n@@ dra@@ de is the main shareholder of the P@@ o@@ s@@ a@@ d@@ as hotel chain .
Op@@ posing Dra@@ gon Mart
A group of local and foreign e@@ n@@ vir@@ o@@ n@@ ment@@ alists , academics , businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dra@@ gon Mart in Canc@@ un .
As you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , selling Chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies .
Previously , Can@@ a@@ c@@ i@@ n@@ tra had managed to u@@ n@@ ite the governors of the southeast of Mexico to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry .
The death of A@@ C@@ TA
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mex@@ ican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-@@ Counter@@ f@@ e@@ i@@ t@@ ing Trade Agre@@ ement , known by its acron@@ ym A@@ C@@ TA , according to the Mex@@ ican Institute of Industrial Property , and the matter has already been arch@@ ived .
As you know , the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility , d@@ e@@ e@@ m@@ ing it an infrin@@ gement of freedom of expression on social networks .

The issue is the first of four identical issues which are offering to r@@ e@@ pay interest every 28 days .

Hec@@ tor " H@@ e@@ t@@ in " Reyes : " Basketball has been my life "
Basketball glo@@ b@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ tter Hec@@ tor " H@@ e@@ t@@ in " Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , travelled the world .
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recolle@@ ction of local basketball history as broad as that of H@@ é@@ ctor " H@@ e@@ t@@ in " Reyes .
Reyes was i@@ m@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ sed in the sport for over 60 years before being c@@ o@@ n@@ fined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke ; he was a minor league player , National Superior Basketball player , B@@ S@@ N representative and manager with the Bay@@ a@@ m@@ ón V@@ aqu@@ eros or President of the Basketball Federation .
" I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the B@@ S@@ N , general manager and f@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ative president of the National Team during the ' 90s , " recalled Reyes during Pri@@ mera Hor@@ a 's visit to his home in Bay@@ a@@ m@@ ón , where he lives with Isa@@ bel , his loyal wife for over 50 years .
" Basketball has been my life . "
Reyes is not exagger@@ ating when he makes that statement .
The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia d@@ e@@ n@@ o@@ ting his long career , which goes to prove it .
Bay@@ a@@ m@@ ón at heart
Of them all , the ones he treasures with the most emo@@ tion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the V@@ aqu@@ eros , from the mid-@@ 50s as a player until 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 , when he completed 15 years serving as co-@@ agent or agent of the franchise .
" Those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ aqu@@ eros ' eight champion@@ ships , since 1967 , either as agent , co-@@ agent or manager .
There were many good years , including the five consecutive champion@@ ships from 1971 to 1975 .
And then I said good@@ bye with one in 1981 , Jer@@ ome M@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ y 's debut year in the B@@ S@@ N .
Then " Cu@@ co " Ortiz took over - he was a great manager " said Reyes .
I remember that Gene Bar@@ tow , who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , said to me ' I 've got a very strong player for you , 6 ' 7 " tall .
Do you want him ? '
And that was the beginning of M@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ y , one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had .
Bar@@ tow then recommended the shar@@ p@@ shoo@@ ter G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ se Raymond , who established residency here and was one of our best shoo@@ ters .
I remember him saying that if M@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ y had given Bay@@ amon one championship , G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ se would help get another .
The V@@ aqu@@ eros ' championship with G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ se was enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a f@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ative big@@ shot .
For that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and M@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ y 's accomplishments in the national team .
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre-@@ Olympics in Mexico .
Then came the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been b@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ze , but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Reyes .
Is the 1990 World National Team the best you 've ever seen ?
It 's one of the best , as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics .
However , my favourite was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba , when we won gold and gave the US team a beating , which was quite similar to the time we won b@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ze at the World Cup .
That team not only again included M@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ y , G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ se , Ram@@ on Ri@@ vas , F@@ ico L@@ ó@@ p@@ e@@ z and ' Pic@@ u@@ l@@ í@@ n ' ( Ortiz ) , but also the young ( Javier ) ' T@@ o@@ ñ@@ i@@ t@@ o ' Col@@ ón and James Carter , the Leon brothers ( Francisco and Edgar ) and Mario ' Q@@ u@@ ijo@@ te ' Morales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury .
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold medal and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 Pre-@@ Olympic team in Neu@@ q@@ u@@ en , Argentina .
With role players such as ' Can@@ i@@ t@@ o ' Nie@@ ves , P@@ a@@ b@@ l@@ o A@@ lic@@ ea and the young Rol@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ o H@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ r@@ u@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ er replacing the players suspended after the sham@@ bles of the Mar del Plat@@ a Pan@@ -@@ American Games , we won gold against all the odds .
Who was the best Puerto Rican player ?
Without any doubt , Pic@@ u@@ l@@ í@@ n Ortiz .
His numbers at international tournament level are aw@@ esome .
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Pic@@ u@@ l@@ í@@ n did .
Not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in .
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager ?
That 's a difficult one .
We had a very good team , including Julio Tor@@ o , Fl@@ or Mel@@ e@@ n@@ dez , Carlos Morales , Raymond D@@ a@@ l@@ m@@ a@@ u , A@@ r@@ mand@@ i@@ t@@ o Torres .
Of the youngsters , I really like the work of L@@ e@@ o A@@ r@@ ill .
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation ?
Having been part of the National Team 's most gl@@ o@@ r@@ ious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the B@@ S@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season .
What was there left for you to do ?
There were things I 'd have liked to implement , such as r@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ a@@ l@@ ising the minor leagues .
For example , the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs .
Right now the kids are riding and playing too much , u@@ n@@ necessarily .
At least I see the fruit of compul@@ sory certi@@ fic@@ ations and a course for leaders , table officials and refer@@ ees .
That ple@@ ases me .
What are you doing now ?
The most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on YouTube , enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games .
And of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .
Ac@@ tor Larry Hag@@ man dies
Larry Hag@@ man , born on 21 September 1@@ 9@@ 31 in Fort Worth ( Texas ) , became world famous for his role as John Ross E@@ wing , better known as " J@@ R , " in the television series " Dallas , " in which he played a ruthless , malicious and manipulative business@@ man .
Larry Hag@@ man , whose role as oil tycoon predator J@@ R E@@ wing in the television series " Dallas " became a symbol of greed in the 1980s , has died .
He was 81 .
Hag@@ man , who returned this year as J@@ R in a new season of " Dallas , " died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications , according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by the Warner Bros. , producer of " Dallas . "
" Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas , once again representing the iconic role he most liked " the family said .
Larry 's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday .
Linda Gray , who played his wife in the original series and the sequel , was with Hag@@ man when he died in a hospital in Dallas , said her public@@ ist , Jeffrey Lane .
He brought joy to all who knew him .
He was creative , gener@@ ous , funny , loving and talented , and I will miss him d@@ e@@ arly .
" He was an original guy and lived life to the full " said Gray in a statement .
Hag@@ man was diagno@@ sed with cir@@ r@@ h@@ o@@ sis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years .
In 1995 a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our as found in his liver and he under@@ went a transplant .
Years before " Dallas , " Hag@@ man became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy " I Dream of Je@@ annie , " aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970 .
He played Cap@@ tain Tony Nelson , an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie , played by Barbara E@@ den , and takes her home to live with him .
He also starred in two sit@@ c@@ o@@ m@@ s that were not aired for long , " The Good Life " ( NBC , 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1-@@ 72 ) and " Here We Go Again " ( ABC , 1973 ) .
His film work included roles well received by critics in " The Group , " " Harry and Ton@@ to " and " Pri@@ mary Col@@ ors . "
But it was his m@@ a@@ ster@@ ful interpretation of del@@ igh@@ t@@ fully d@@ e@@ test@@ able J@@ R that led to Hag@@ man reaching his peak of s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ dom .
The drama series on CBS about the E@@ wing cl@@ an and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1@@ 9@@ 78 to May 1991 .
The t@@ a@@ g@@ line " Who shot J@@ R ? , " designed to generate h@@ yp@@ e around an episode full of emo@@ tions in which Hag@@ man 's character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wag@@ ered in gaming e@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ b@@ l@@ ish@@ ments .
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time .
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million viewers tun@@ ed in and made " Dallas " the second most watched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of " M@@ AS@@ H " in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers .
It was J@@ R 's s@@ i@@ ster-@@ in-law Krist@@ in ( played by Mary Cros@@ by ) who shot him .
J@@ R got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a p@@ r@@ o@@ stit@@ ute unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him .
Hag@@ man portra@@ yed E@@ wing as a cor@@ rupt ins@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ able man with a charis@@ matic smile : a dish@@ o@@ n@@ est entrep@@ rene@@ ur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoho@@ lic wife , Sue Ellen ( Linda Gray ) , sec@@ tion@@ ed .
" I know what I want on J@@ R 's tom@@ bst@@ one " Hag@@ man said in 1988 .
It should read : " Here lies the honest citi@@ zen J@@ R E@@ wing . "
This is the only deal he lost .
Vic@@ tor@@ ia Principal , co-star of the original series , recalled Hag@@ man on Friday as someone " huge , on and off screen . "
He is u@@ n@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ able and i@@ r@@ replac@@ eable , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him .
Ten episodes of the new edition of " Dallas " were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT .
He had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain reported .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after , there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of Hag@@ man .
Hag@@ man , born in Fort Worth , Texas , was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin , who starred in classi@@ cs such as " South Pacific " and " Peter Pan . "
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1@@ 9@@ 31 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hag@@ man .
He tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early ' 50s , and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1@@ 9@@ 56 , in England .
While there , he met the young Swedish designer Ma@@ j Ax@@ els@@ son and married her .
The couple had two sons , Preston and Heidi , and lived for a long time in the Californian city Malibu , home to many celebr@@ ities .
In 2001 , he called his mem@@ oirs " Hello Dar@@ lin ' : T@@ all ( and A@@ b@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ u@@ t@@ ely True ) Tales About My Life . "
" I didn 't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way " he told Associated Press at the time .
After his liver transplant , he became an organ don@@ ation promo@@ ter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital , helping fear@@ ful patients .
" I adv@@ ise them , encourage them , meet with them when they come for their surgery , and afterwards " he said in 1996 .
I try to offer some comfort , such as " Don 't be afraid , it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time , but then you 'll be fine . "
He was also an anti-@@ smoking activist and took part in several campaigns .
Start of a course that explo@@ res the " End of the World "
Each week , students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ies , vir@@ uses and germs , and global warming .
This term , when Professor of religion , Stuart Char@@ m@@ é , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a compelling hook : The end of the " long c@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ t@@ down " of the May@@ an calendar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming .
But Char@@ m@@ é had no idea what awaited him over the next couple of months : The catac@@ ly@@ smic hurricane Sandy , a fiscal precip@@ ice some called " debt Arma@@ ged@@ don " and a growing conflict involving Israel , where end-@@ of-@@ the-@@ world Christians the@@ o@@ r@@ ists think the A@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ pse will begin .
" I didn 't real@@ ise this was going to be the most apocalyptic term ever " said Char@@ m@@ é this week to students at Rut@@ g@@ e@@ r@@ s-@@ Cam@@ den University ( New Jersey ) .
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic ment@@ ality .
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the " end of the world " this term , theo@@ reti@@ cally the last in history .
At Temple , Associ@@ ate Professor Barry V@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ er is giving the course " Media , Cul@@ ture and the end of the world . "
Each week , students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ies , vir@@ uses and germs , and global warming .
" We looked at why these ideas p@@ r@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ate over time " he said , and how they offer hy@@ pothe@@ tical scen@@ arios that guide human behaviour .
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
This month students analy@@ sed movies with an apocalyptic theme and explo@@ red how they compare with real-life examples .
" I 've tried to inform students about what is possible , prob@@ able , credible and impossible " said V@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ er .
At the main Pennsylvania State University campus , Latin American History Professor Matthew Rest@@ all , and his colleague Amar@@ a Sol@@ ari , an Associ@@ ate Art History and A@@ n@@ thro@@ polo@@ gy Professor , have t@@ e@@ amed up to give a course , called simply " The end of the world . "
" We don 't add ' 2012 ' so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world doesn 't come to an end " said Rest@@ all .
Despite the " impending doom , " students have to study , under@@ take projects and take final e@@ x@@ ams .
At Penn State , the final exam will be taken on the eve of the A@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ pse , which leaves students no choice but to work " until the very night the world is supposed to end " said Rest@@ all .
The courses proved quite popular .
" It was fully booked within two hours " said Rest@@ all , on his course for students with high aver@@ ages , which was filled with 35 students .
We received e@@ m@@ ails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places .
Students , meanwhile , say the course is one of the most interesting around .
" I find it fas@@ cin@@ ating to see what people do to console themselves " said Bri@@ d@@ g@@ id Robinson , a 23-year-old post-@@ graduate Religion and So@@ c@@ i@@ ology student from H@@ a@@ d@@ d@@ o@@ n@@ field , New Jersey , at Rut@@ g@@ e@@ r@@ s-@@ Cam@@ den .
And the apocalyptic , secular or religious ment@@ ality is just a matter consol@@ ation or a lack of it .
Will We@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ a , a 25@@ -year-old post-@@ graduate Psych@@ ology and N@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ ing student , said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies .
" I 'd never heard of a class that could teach it " he said .
I enjoy it .
But none of the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st .
" Our first project was about the May@@ an proph@@ e@@ c@@ y and to a certain extent we disc@@ red@@ ited it " said Julie Z@@ e@@ g@@ len , a 21-year-old final year student at Temple , from West Che@@ ster .
The May@@ ans never predicted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said Rest@@ all .
But he said that Western culture suff@@ ers from apocalyptic anxiety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predic@@ ting the end of the world .
The Internet has caused a boom in these specul@@ ations .
" In other places , people don 't think about it " he said .
It 's mostly in the Eng@@ l@@ ish@@ -@@ speaking world .
Joseph Dou@@ g@@ h@@ erty , a Professor of religion at La S@@ a@@ l@@ le University , who is giving courses in the Philippines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the " end of the world " there .
" The Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world " he wrote , suggesting an exception of a higher authority .
We have an ind@@ u@@ l@@ gence from the Pop@@ e .
Rest@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , " people will immediately start thinking of the next date " or p@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ p@@ h@@ ising that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-@@ year period after which the world will end .
Students and teachers are taking the date ligh@@ tly .
Some said they plan to go to " end of the world " parties .
" Maybe I 'll call some friends so we can have a laugh together " said Sam@@ i@@ r@@ a Ford , 20@@ -year-old communications student .
