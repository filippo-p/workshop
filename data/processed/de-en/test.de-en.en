Obama receives N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u
The rel@@ ation@@ ship between Obama and N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u is not exactly fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly .
The two wanted to talk about the im@@ p@@ le@@ m@@ ent@@ ation of the international agreement and about T@@ e@@ h@@ er@@ an 's de@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ i@@ s@@ ing activities in the M@@ id@@ d@@ le East .
The meeting was also planned to cover the con@@ fli@@ c@@ t with the Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans and the disp@@ ut@@ ed two state solution .
Rel@@ ations between Obama and N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u have been stra@@ in@@ ed for years .
Washington c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ es the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ou@@ s building of se@@ tt@@ le@@ ments in Israel and ac@@ c@@ us@@ es N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u of a lack of in@@ it@@ i@@ ative in the peace process .
The rel@@ ation@@ ship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ated on Iran 's atomic programme , .
In March , at the in@@ v@@ itation of the Republicans , N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t to Obama .
The speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time im@@ p@@ en@@ ding in Israel .
In 911 Call , Pro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or Ad@@ m@@ its to Sh@@ oo@@ ting G@@ ir@@ l@@ friend
In a 911 call , his voice only slightly s@@ ha@@ ky , college p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b told police he had shot his g@@ ir@@ l@@ friend and officers needed to get over to their h@@ ou@@ se .
Lam@@ b made a point to say his " sweet dog " was there alive and probably u@@ p@@ set , and said the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on her phone .
In@@ side the home , officers found Amy P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s ' body and a hand-@@ w@@ r@@ it@@ ten note sc@@ ri@@ bbled on a white legal p@@ ad : " I am so very sor@@ ry I wish I could take it back I lo@@ v@@ ed Amy and she is the only woman who ever lo@@ v@@ ed me , " read the letter authorities say was signed by Lam@@ b .
There was no in@@ di@@ c@@ ation that Lam@@ b , who was te@@ a@@ ch@@ ing two online cl@@ as@@ s@@ es for D@@ el@@ t@@ a State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already tra@@ v@@ el@@ ed 300 miles to the school 's campus , where police believe he shot and killed a w@@ ell@@ -@@ liked history p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or , E@@ than S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t , in the do@@ or@@ way to his office .
D@@ el@@ t@@ a State University police chief L@@ yn@@ n Bu@@ f@@ or@@ d said un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.@@ m .
He said Lam@@ b made the f@@ at@@ eful 911 call s@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ time after that .
By the end of the day , there would be one more death : Lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
A day after the school shooting forced students and f@@ ac@@ ul@@ ty to hi@@ de behind locked do@@ ors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lam@@ b .
The details released by in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ at@@ ors at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped p@@ ain@@ t a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
St@@ ud@@ ent@@ s said they looked forward to his class .
Police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s died , said he had no history of viol@@ ence or criminal record .
S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t himself had included Lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the " w@@ on@@ der@@ ful people " he shared his ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ic life with .
Both taught in the Division of S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Sci@@ en@@ ces and History , which lists 17 f@@ ac@@ ul@@ ty members , and many students took co@@ ur@@ s@@ es from both .
At the same time , there were some inc@@ l@@ in@@ ations of problems .
A student who p@@ r@@ a@@ ised Lam@@ b , Brandon Be@@ aver@@ s , said he also seemed ag@@ it@@ ated and j@@ it@@ ter@@ y , " like there was something w@@ r@@ ong with him . "
Another student , M@@ i@@ k@@ el Sy@@ kes , said Lam@@ b told him he was de@@ aling with stress at the end of the 20@@ 14-@@ 15 ac@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ic year .
Lam@@ b had earlier asked D@@ el@@ t@@ a State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
This year , he was only te@@ a@@ ch@@ ing two online cl@@ as@@ s@@ es .
Rec@@ ent changes in the un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity 's h@@ ir@@ ing po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es meant that the doc@@ torate Lam@@ b had worked so hard to e@@ ar@@ n would not g@@ u@@ ar@@ an@@ tee him an a@@ u@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c ten@@ ure track to become an assistant p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn 't know of any con@@ fli@@ c@@ t between Lam@@ b and S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t but " ob@@ vi@@ ously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b 's mind . "
Those are questions Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
After f@@ le@@ e@@ ing the campus , police later p@@ i@@ c@@ ked up Lam@@ b 's trail when he c@@ ro@@ s@@ s@@ ed back into Mississippi from Arkansas .
Be@@ f@@ or@@ e he could be a@@ p@@ pre@@ h@@ ended , Lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 3@@ 8-@@ c@@ al@@ i@@ b@@ er pistol in the b@@ ack@@ y@@ ar@@ d of a home about a m@@ ile s@@ ou@@ th of his parents ' home on the ou@@ t@@ s@@ k@@ ir@@ ts of G@@ re@@ en@@ v@@ ille , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ on@@ er Me@@ th@@ el Johnson .
His car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
It was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
Lam@@ b started working at the un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity , which has 3@@ ,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 and taught g@@ e@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ y and education cl@@ as@@ s@@ es .
He received a doc@@ torate in education in the sp@@ r@@ ing .
One of Lam@@ b 's longtime friends described him as s@@ m@@ ar@@ t , char@@ i@@ s@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c and f@@ un@@ n@@ y .
Car@@ la H@@ a@@ ir@@ st@@ on said she was 15 and Lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mut@@ ual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the co@@ o@@ l older guy who tried for several years to te@@ a@@ ch her to play guitar .
He was quite the heart@@ th@@ ro@@ b back then .
All the girls would m@@ el@@ t when he was around , " said H@@ a@@ ir@@ st@@ on , now 40 and living in the Jackson su@@ bur@@ b of Brandon .
Lam@@ b and P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s had a@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly been dating for some time .
In the 911 call , Lam@@ b said " I killed my wife , " but there was no record of them ever m@@ ar@@ r@@ y@@ ing .
They had a dog named L@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ n@@ ing that lived with them at the bri@@ ck h@@ ou@@ se that backs up to a b@@ ay@@ o@@ u in Gau@@ tier .
Police said the dog was OK .
P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s ' e@@ x@@ -@@ husband , Shawn O '@@ S@@ te@@ en , said they di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who 's now 19 .
" She was com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely devastated , " O '@@ S@@ te@@ en said of his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O '@@ S@@ te@@ en said he had not met Lam@@ b but heard through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ a@@ il that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played the b@@ lu@@ es .
Lam@@ b met P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s when he and Ab@@ ig@@ a@@ il both performed at a su@@ m@@ m@@ er fair three years ago .
L@@ ater , they played together in the o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on@@ al g@@ i@@ g .
O '@@ S@@ te@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s was a n@@ ur@@ se who worked for v@@ ar@@ ious companies online .
Mike Sha@@ f@@ f@@ er , a bar@@ ten@@ der and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p R@@ oo@@ m , a di@@ m@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw Lam@@ b and P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s the night of Sept . 5 , after Lam@@ b had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
There was no sign of anything am@@ i@@ s@@ s .
" Just a happy couple , " he said .
We were c@@ ut@@ ting up and throwing one-@@ liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of w@@ it about them .
S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t , the s@@ la@@ in p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or , directed the f@@ ir@@ st@@ -@@ year se@@ m@@ in@@ ar program and specialized in N@@ ative American and colonial history , said D@@ on All@@ an Mitchell , an English p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or at the school .
He was m@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed and had three young children .
He studied at E@@ m@@ p@@ or@@ ia State University in Kansas and was president of his f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity and student government .
On the D@@ el@@ t@@ a State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , about 9@@ 00 people , including f@@ ac@@ ul@@ ty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a c@@ an@@ d@@ l@@ el@@ ig@@ h@@ t memorial .
S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t 's wife , Liz , and brother Jeff S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t also attended the v@@ ig@@ il , during which the un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity ch@@ o@@ ir s@@ an@@ g " B@@ right Mor@@ n@@ ing St@@ ar " and " A@@ m@@ a@@ z@@ ing Gr@@ ace . "
Cl@@ as@@ s@@ es re@@ su@@ me Wednesday .
" We 're trying to get our students to come back , " La@@ For@@ ge said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ g@@ el@@ io S@@ o@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press writers E@@ m@@ il@@ y W@@ ag@@ ster P@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ us in G@@ re@@ en@@ v@@ ille , Mississippi , and Re@@ be@@ c@@ ca S@@ an@@ t@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story has been cor@@ rec@@ ted to re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t that police are now saying Lam@@ b made the 911 call after shooting S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t , and that while Lam@@ b re@@ fer@@ red to P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s as his wife in the 911 call , there is no in@@ di@@ c@@ ation the two ever m@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed .

T@@ o@@ ys R Us says it won 't h@@ ir@@ e as many h@@ o@@ li@@ day season employees as it did last year , but the to@@ y and b@@ ab@@ y products retailer says it will give current employees and se@@ as@@ on@@ al workers a chance to work more hours .
The company said it plans to h@@ ir@@ e 40,000 people to work at stores and di@@ stri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on centers around the country , down from the 4@@ 5,000 hired for the 20@@ 14 h@@ o@@ li@@ day season .

The pre@@ m@@ i@@ er@@ e of " B@@ ac@@ k to the Fut@@ ure " was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ ally .
It was n@@ o@@ te@@ wor@@ th@@ y because of per@@ s@@ on@@ al re@@ as@@ on@@ s , too .
" We were sitting in the theater waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als to come in and I re@@ al@@ i@@ ze that the seat next to me is em@@ p@@ ty , and it d@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ s on me that Princ@@ ess Di@@ ana is going to be sitting next to me , " he said in a tra@@ iler for an u@@ p@@ coming doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ar@@ y , " B@@ ac@@ k in Time .

U@@ N Chief S@@ ay@@ s There Is No Military Solution in Syria
S@@ ec@@ re@@ tar@@ y-@@ General Ban K@@ i@@ -@@ moon says his response to Russia 's st@@ e@@ pped up military support for Syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly fi@@ v@@ e-@@ year con@@ fli@@ c@@ t and more weapons will only wor@@ sen the viol@@ ence and misery for millions of people .
The U.N. chief again urged all parties , including the di@@ vi@@ ded U.N. Security Council , to un@@ it@@ e and support inc@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ e negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five per@@ man@@ ent council n@@ ations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly 's m@@ in@@ i@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ al session later this month to discuss Syria .
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Sy@@ ri@@ an people and regional powers " made this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . "
Ban urged the five per@@ man@@ ent members to show the so@@ li@@ d@@ ar@@ ity and un@@ ity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in ad@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ sing the Syria crisis .
8 Pol@@ l N@@ um@@ bers That Show D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p Is For Real
Some have tried to la@@ be@@ l him a fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ pper .
Others have dismissed him as a jo@@ k@@ e .
And some are holding out for an im@@ p@@ lo@@ si@@ on .
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p down from at@@ o@@ p the polls , it hasn 't worked ( yet ) .
T@@ en of the last 11 national polls have sh@@ own D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's lead at double digits , and some are starting to ask seriously what it m@@ e@@ ans for the real e@@ st@@ ate mo@@ g@@ u@@ l 's n@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ation ch@@ an@@ ces .
Of course , it 's still early in the election c@@ y@@ c@@ le .
N@@ one of this is to say that T@@ ru@@ m@@ p is likely to win the Republican n@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ation .
P@@ und@@ its point out that at this time in 20@@ 11 , R@@ ick Per@@ ry 's lead was giving way to a rising H@@ er@@ man C@@ a@@ in , neither of whom won even one state in the n@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ation process .
And there are many re@@ as@@ on@@ s he would st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ le in a general election .
But outside groups like J@@ e@@ b Bush 's Su@@ per P@@ AC and the economic conservative group Club for Gro@@ w@@ th are re@@ co@@ gn@@ izing T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's st@@ ay@@ ing power and beginning to un@@ lo@@ ad their dollars to topple him .
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real e@@ st@@ ate mo@@ g@@ u@@ l isn 't just a passing ph@@ as@@ e :
T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's f@@ a@@ v@@ or@@ ability ratings have turned 180 de@@ g@@ re@@ es .
R@@ ig@@ h@@ t before D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p announced his candidacy in mid-@@ June , a Mon@@ m@@ ou@@ th University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e view of the real e@@ st@@ ate mo@@ g@@ u@@ l .
By mid-@@ July , it was 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six in 10 Republicans have a f@@ a@@ v@@ or@@ able view of D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p .
Rou@@ gh@@ ly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
And these numbers hold up in early states .
A Q@@ u@@ in@@ n@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ a@@ c poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a f@@ a@@ v@@ or@@ able view of T@@ ru@@ m@@ p .
T@@ w@@ o-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of GOP voters would be happy with T@@ ru@@ m@@ p as the nominee .
In a C@@ N@@ N / OR@@ C poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either " enthusi@@ ast@@ ic " or " s@@ at@@ i@@ s@@ fied " if T@@ ru@@ m@@ p were the nominee .
Only two in 10 say they would be " u@@ p@@ set " if he were the nominee .
Only Ben Car@@ son gen@@ er@@ at@@ es rou@@ gh@@ ly the same level of enthusiasm as T@@ ru@@ m@@ p ( 4@@ 3 percent say they would be " enthusi@@ ast@@ ic " vs. 40 percent who say the same of T@@ ru@@ m@@ p ) .
The next closest in enthusiasm ?
Mar@@ co R@@ u@@ b@@ io with only 21 percent .
On the fli@@ p side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be " di@@ s@@ s@@ at@@ i@@ s@@ fied " or " u@@ p@@ set " if establishment favorite J@@ e@@ b Bush becomes the nominee .
A majority of Republicans don 't see T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's te@@ m@@ per@@ am@@ ent as a problem .
While D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p has been wi@@ d@@ ely criticized for his b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ast and in@@ su@@ l@@ ts , 52 percent of le@@ an@@ ed Republican voters nationwide think that the real e@@ st@@ ate mo@@ g@@ u@@ l has the right te@@ m@@ per@@ am@@ ent to be president , according to Monday 's ABC News / Washington Post poll .
The same number h@@ ol@@ ds in the f@@ ir@@ st@@ -@@ in-@@ th@@ e-@@ nation c@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ us state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the per@@ s@@ on@@ ality to be commander in chief , according to Q@@ u@@ in@@ n@@ i@@ p@@ i@@ a@@ c last week .
Still , 44 percent think he doesn 't have the per@@ s@@ on@@ ality to serve eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely , and almost six in 10 in@@ de@@ p@@ en@@ d@@ ent@@ s say his te@@ m@@ per@@ am@@ ent does not b@@ el@@ ong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
When they put on their pun@@ dit h@@ at@@ s , Republican voters think T@@ ru@@ m@@ p is for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP n@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ation , four in 10 said T@@ ru@@ m@@ p was the best bet , according to a C@@ N@@ N / OR@@ C poll out last week .
That 's a change from when four in 10 plac@@ ed their money on J@@ e@@ b Bush in late July .
F@@ ull di@@ sc@@ lo@@ s@@ ure : GOP voters haven 't had the c@@ le@@ are@@ s@@ t cr@@ y@@ st@@ al ball in the past .
At this time last c@@ y@@ c@@ le , four in 10 Republicans p@@ i@@ c@@ ked R@@ ick Per@@ ry to win the n@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ation , vs. only 28 percent for event@@ ual nominee Mitt Romney .
Still , it shows that a pl@@ ur@@ ality of GOP voters see T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's campaign as pl@@ a@@ u@@ si@@ ble .
Even if Republicans r@@ al@@ li@@ ed around another candidate , T@@ ru@@ m@@ p still be@@ ats almost everyone .
Some pundits point out that the sp@@ l@@ in@@ ter@@ ed field is likely con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ ing to T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's lead , while an@@ ti@@ -T@@ ru@@ m@@ p support is be sp@@ re@@ ad di@@ f@@ f@@ us@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
But a Mon@@ m@@ ou@@ th University poll in early September shows that , in a h@@ y@@ po@@ the@@ tic@@ al head@@ -@@ to-@@ head m@@ at@@ ch@@ up between T@@ ru@@ m@@ p and most other Republican candidates , T@@ ru@@ m@@ p almost always g@@ ar@@ ners majority support .
He le@@ ads Car@@ ly F@@ i@@ or@@ in@@ a by 13 points , Mar@@ co R@@ u@@ b@@ io by 14 points , Wal@@ ker by 15 points , J@@ e@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , R@@ and Paul , John K@@ a@@ si@@ ch and Chris Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ie by 33 points each .
He 's in a dead heat with Ted C@@ ru@@ z .
The only candidate who be@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ man by a wide 19 points in a h@@ y@@ po@@ the@@ tic@@ al head@@ -@@ to-@@ head .
A bare majority of D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's supporters say they 've made up their m@@ in@@ ds .
A new CBS / N@@ Y@@ T poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support T@@ ru@@ m@@ p say they have locked in their votes .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the do@@ or open to s@@ w@@ it@@ ching candidates .
Still , T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's str@@ on@@ g@@ es@@ t competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ si@@ der ne@@ u@@ ro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their m@@ in@@ ds are twice as likely to go for T@@ ru@@ m@@ p .
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with T@@ ru@@ m@@ p on immigration .
Even since D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p called immigrants from Mexico " r@@ a@@ p@@ ists " in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 20@@ 16 con@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ation .
Some are worried that T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ast will drive crucial H@@ i@@ s@@ p@@ an@@ ic voters away from the Republican P@@ ar@@ ty and damage re@@ b@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ ing efforts .
But according to Monday 's new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with T@@ ru@@ m@@ p on immigration issues .
So as long as immigration remains in the sp@@ o@@ t@@ light , it seems D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p will remain too .
Fru@@ stration with government is clim@@ b@@ ing to new high@@ s .
D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p and Ben Car@@ son now account for rou@@ gh@@ ly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their out@@ si@@ der status .
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday 's new ABC / Post poll say they want a political out@@ si@@ der over someone with government experience .
And they are an@@ g@@ r@@ y at Washington , too .
A Des Mo@@ ines Reg@@ i@@ st@@ er / B@@ lo@@ o@@ m@@ berg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent " un@@ s@@ at@@ i@@ s@@ fied " and 21 percent " m@@ a@@ d as h@@ el@@ l . "
M@@ un@@ i@@ ch , Sy@@ l@@ t un@@ d Co . : the five most exclusive re@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al areas in Germany
The most e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e re@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al developments are located here in H@@ ob@@ oo@@ ken@@ w@@ e@@ g - with a view over the North Sea mud@@ flat@@ s .
On this road one square m@@ e@@ t@@ re of a th@@ at@@ ched h@@ ou@@ se costs an average of € 7@@ 3@@ ,@@ 300 .
" On Sy@@ l@@ t , the number of p@@ ro@@ per@@ ties on offer is naturally limited , " says a study - hence the high prices .
This new study in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ es the partic@@ ul@@ ar locations with the most e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation per square m@@ e@@ t@@ re .
Of course , € 18@@ .@@ 70 per square m@@ e@@ t@@ re for student di@@ g@@ s in M@@ un@@ i@@ ch is not really low .
Com@@ p@@ a@@ red with Germany 's top areas , however , this price seems likes pe@@ an@@ ut@@ s .
Pro@@ per@@ ty service En@@ g@@ e@@ l & V@@ ol@@ k@@ ers has published a league table of the most exclusive re@@ si@@ den@@ ti@@ al areas in Germany - with st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ingly high prices per square m@@ e@@ t@@ re .
More than € 10,000 is nothing there - per qu@@ are m@@ e@@ t@@ re , mind you .
O@@ k , if you can 't afford it ...
In@@ c@@ i@@ dent@@ ally , for once M@@ un@@ i@@ ch is not in the lead .
Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League : Bay@@ er@@ n off to a d@@ re@@ am start th@@ an@@ ks to M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler and G@@ ö@@ t@@ z@@ e
D@@ ou@@ ble goal sc@@ or@@ er in P@@ i@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us : Bay@@ er@@ n star Thomas M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler is simply on a ro@@ ll .
A lucky goal from Thomas M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler p@@ av@@ ed the way for a 3 : 0 victory for FC Bay@@ er@@ n at O@@ l@@ y@@ p@@ i@@ ac@@ os P@@ i@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us - then it got better .
A confident start to the Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League season .
World ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s Thomas M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler and Mar@@ io G@@ ö@@ t@@ z@@ e brought about a d@@ re@@ am start to their " M@@ il@@ an M@@ i@@ s@@ si@@ on " in the se@@ e@@ thing c@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ d@@ r@@ on at P@@ i@@ re@@ a@@ u@@ s .
T@@ r@@ a@@ in@@ er Pe@@ p Guar@@ di@@ ola 's team won their opening match in the Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League in a hot atmosphere away to the G@@ re@@ ek record h@@ ol@@ der@@ s , th@@ an@@ ks to M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler 's b@@ r@@ ace ( 5@@ 2nd and 90@@ th minutes + 2 ) and G@@ ö@@ t@@ z@@ e 's goal ( 8@@ 9@@ th minute ) , ending in a score of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The tw@@ el@@ f@@ th successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in I@@ tal@@ y on 28 May 20@@ 16 , where Guar@@ di@@ ola wants to end his third attempt by taking the trophy back to M@@ un@@ i@@ ch .
With his 28@@ th goal in the Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League , M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler took Bay@@ er@@ n into the lead with the g@@ r@@ ac@@ ious help of O@@ l@@ y@@ m@@ i@@ ac@@ os go@@ al@@ ie Ro@@ b@@ er@@ to , who let through a c@@ ro@@ s@@ s shot from the world ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion .
" We aren 't going to un@@ der@@ estimate them , " p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed Bay@@ er@@ n c@@ a@@ p@@ ta@@ in P@@ h@@ illi@@ p@@ p Lah@@ m before the game in the K@@ ar@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ k@@ ak@@ is St@@ a@@ di@@ um in front of 3@@ 1,@@ 68@@ 8 h@@ o@@ t@@ -@@ b@@ loo@@ ded fans - and the M@@ un@@ i@@ ch player kept his word .
They de@@ m@@ on@@ str@@ ated a con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ated and committed performance without being show@@ y .
P@@ i@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us had won their six most recent pre@@ m@@ i@@ er@@ e class home games , including against prominent c@@ lu@@ bs such as M@@ an@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ er United , A@@ t@@ le@@ tic@@ o Mad@@ ri@@ d and Ju@@ vent@@ us T@@ ur@@ in .
In 20@@ 11 B@@ or@@ us@@ si@@ a D@@ or@@ t@@ m@@ un@@ d st@@ umbled here too .
But Bay@@ er@@ n , un@@ de@@ fe@@ ated in seven E@@ u@@ ro@@ p@@ a Cup du@@ els with G@@ re@@ ek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
They went to work bol@@ d@@ ly , but often too un@@ inspired in their off@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e efforts .
A@@ tt@@ ac@@ ks were too often in@@ it@@ i@@ ated by bringing left w@@ in@@ g@@ er D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as Costa , who r@@ a@@ re@@ ly got past former B@@ r@@ un@@ s@@ w@@ ick player Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i , into play .
M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler had more lu@@ ck from the right when his c@@ ro@@ s@@ s shot from right field drove into the top left cor@@ ner of the goal .
In the 67@@ th minute the world ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ w@@ an@@ d@@ ow@@ sk@@ i had the best op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es in the first half .

Although Bay@@ er@@ n is used to playing a d@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ant game , P@@ i@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us were able to needle them .
But they could count on go@@ al@@ keeper M@@ an@@ u@@ el Ne@@ u@@ er .
For example when he st@@ e@@ ered a shot from I@@ de@@ ye over the c@@ ro@@ ss@@ bar in the 56@@ th minute .
Guar@@ di@@ ola had a fo@@ ur@@ -@@ man b@@ ack@@ field def@@ ence de@@ plo@@ y@@ ed in front of Ne@@ u@@ er , with David Al@@ b@@ a in the centre next to J@@ er@@ o@@ m@@ e Bo@@ at@@ en@@ g .

At the first change , Guar@@ di@@ ola decided against him , when he brought in Kings@@ ley Com@@ an for the stri@@ ck@@ en Le@@ w@@ an@@ d@@ ow@@ sk@@ i in the 5@@ 9@@ th minute .
G@@ ö@@ t@@ z@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vidal in the 76@@ th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler put another one in with a p@@ en@@ al@@ ty .
Be@@ f@@ or@@ e the match there was a ri@@ o@@ t in the st@@ a@@ di@@ um .
After a small group of Bay@@ er@@ n fans , some wearing masks , had a@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly provoked supporters of h@@ o@@ st@@ s P@@ i@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us from behind their fence with words and g@@ e@@ st@@ u@@ res , security forces attacked them and used b@@ at@@ on@@ s against the M@@ un@@ i@@ ch supporters .
At least one Bay@@ er@@ n f@@ an was taken injured from the st@@ a@@ di@@ um .
S@@ mo@@ k@@ ers at a greater risk of lo@@ s@@ ing teeth
S@@ mo@@ k@@ ers damage not only their l@@ ung@@ s but also their teeth , conc@@ lu@@ des a long-term study in Po@@ t@@ s@@ d@@ am .
The good news is : if you give up the risk de@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ es fast .
S@@ mo@@ k@@ ers have a si@@ gn@@ ific@@ an@@ t@@ ly increased risk of lo@@ s@@ ing their teeth early .
This em@@ er@@ g@@ es from a long-term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for N@@ ut@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Po@@ t@@ s@@ d@@ am .
Com@@ p@@ a@@ red to n@@ on-@@ s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers , the risk of lo@@ s@@ ing their teeth pre@@ m@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ ly is between 2.@@ 5 and 3@@ .@@ 6 times higher for s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers .
The s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ st@@ s m@@ on@@ it@@ o@@ red more than 2@@ 3@@ ,@@ 300 parti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ an@@ ts .
The main re@@ as@@ on@@ s for t@@ oo@@ th loss are car@@ ies and infl@@ am@@ m@@ ation of the g@@ um@@ s , the DI@@ f@@ E states .
S@@ mo@@ king is a risk factor for this per@@ i@@ o@@ don@@ tit@@ is , emph@@ as@@ ise the authors .
The connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more fre@@ qu@@ ent g@@ um infl@@ am@@ m@@ ation in s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers .
It has not been c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fied to what extent smoking raises the risk of car@@ ies .
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the " Journal of D@@ ent@@ al Research . "
It could however take 10 years before the danger once more drops to the level of n@@ on-@@ s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers ' , de@@ c@@ la@@ red lead a@@ u@@ th@@ or Thomas D@@ i@@ e@@ tri@@ ch of the University of Birmingham in England .
People should be per@@ su@@ ad@@ ed to become n@@ on-@@ s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers , de@@ c@@ la@@ red study leader H@@ ein@@ er Bo@@ e@@ ing of DI@@ f@@ E : " S@@ mo@@ king shor@@ ten@@ s the li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an . "
Not smoking is good for the l@@ ung@@ s and v@@ es@@ s@@ el@@ s and in our experience le@@ ads to good d@@ ent@@ al health to an advanced age .
In Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by t@@ oo@@ th@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ n@@ ess , according to the DI@@ f@@ E .
Earlier st@@ u@@ dies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early t@@ oo@@ th loss .

EU Commission p@@ ro@@ po@@ s@@ es new court in controversy over T@@ T@@ I@@ P
To def@@ use the controversy over the planned Tran@@ s@@ at@@ l@@ an@@ tic T@@ r@@ a@@ de and In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment P@@ ar@@ t@@ ner@@ ship , T@@ T@@ I@@ P , the EU Commission has proposed a sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al reform of the current ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ation system .
According to this , the disp@@ ut@@ ed private ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ation board for conflicts between cor@@ p@@ or@@ ations and countries would be re@@ plac@@ ed by a tr@@ an@@ spar@@ ent system which cor@@ re@@ sp@@ on@@ ds con@@ si@@ der@@ ab@@ ly more in its function to traditional courts .
" We want to set up a system which citizens trust , " st@@ ated the responsible EU Com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ er , C@@ ec@@ ili@@ a Mal@@ str@@ ö@@ m , when in@@ tro@@ du@@ c@@ ing it .
The S@@ w@@ e@@ de plans to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce the proposal as the European ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
The German government has announced its support .
The c@@ re@@ ation of T@@ T@@ I@@ P will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
Plans for reform of the current ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ation procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to jo@@ in@@ t@@ ly select independent j@@ ud@@ g@@ es for a new investment court .
They should come in e@@ qu@@ al p@@ ro@@ p@@ or@@ tions from the EU , the USA and from n@@ on-@@ member countries .
For the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
This would al@@ low for appeals to be made against j@@ ud@@ g@@ e@@ m@@ ent@@ s .
U@@ p to now , the parties to p@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ ings have agreed on the ar@@ bit@@ r@@ at@@ or among themselves and there has been no po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ility of a@@ p@@ pe@@ al against their j@@ ud@@ g@@ e@@ m@@ ent@@ s .
In the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old I@@ S@@ D@@ S system to be fair and just , commented Mal@@ str@@ ö@@ m .
In the long term , according to her statement , she wants to a@@ im at an international investment court .
In this , for example , disp@@ ut@@ es between Chinese companies and EU countries could be c@@ le@@ a@@ red up .
In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ or State Disp@@ ute S@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ le@@ ment ( I@@ S@@ D@@ S ) , which is re@@ qu@@ i@@ red particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main re@@ as@@ on@@ s for the st@@ i@@ f@@ f opposition to the T@@ T@@ I@@ P in Europe .
T@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ation courts are c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ised by ad@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ar@@ ies as a form of par@@ al@@ le@@ l justice through which companies are able to fight for com@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ation at the expense of tax p@@ ay@@ ers , make national la@@ ws n@@ ull and vo@@ id , or en@@ force a lo@@ w@@ er@@ ing of consumer and environmental protection standards .
In initial re@@ actions , anti T@@ T@@ I@@ P or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ations such as Cap@@ act called the EU Commission 's proposals in@@ adequate .
There was criticism in partic@@ ul@@ ar that they would not apply to the already ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ e@@ t@@ a ) .
The German Secretary of State for the E@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ y , M@@ at@@ th@@ i@@ as Mach@@ n@@ i@@ g ( S@@ P@@ D ) , on the other hand , re@@ fer@@ red to the plans as major progress .
The Commission included in the re@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ s key points which Federal E@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ics Minister Sig@@ m@@ ar G@@ ab@@ ri@@ el developed with other EU trade ministers .
The old system of private ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ation courts is off the table .
The French government , too , welcomed Mal@@ str@@ ö@@ m 's plans .
The European business association Bus@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ Europe warned against re@@ stri@@ c@@ ting the op@@ tions for industry to take legal action with too many new r@@ ul@@ es .
Sm@@ all and medi@@ um si@@ z@@ ed enterprises in partic@@ ul@@ ar could be di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ ag@@ ed , they said .
When talks over the T@@ T@@ I@@ P free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on Wednesday .
Ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations have been taking place since the middle of 20@@ 13 .
The issue of in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ or protection , however , has to date not been di@@ sc@@ us@@ s@@ ed with the USA .
It was or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
This date is no longer ten@@ able .
Ex@@ qu@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ e folk from Su@@ f@@ jan S@@ te@@ v@@ ens in Ham@@ bur@@ g
E@@ le@@ v@@ en years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan S@@ te@@ v@@ ens s@@ its on the stage in the Prime Club ( now L@@ u@@ x@@ or ) in C@@ ologne .
B@@ es@@ i@@ de him stands a fli@@ p char@@ t on which the sh@@ y-@@ se@@ em@@ ing folk singer has drawn the p@@ i@@ c@@ tu@@ re@@ s@@ que US state of Michigan in fel@@ t@@ -@@ ti@@ p p@@ en .
The en@@ ti@@ re audience , some 40 people , is v@@ ir@@ tu@@ ally mes@@ mer@@ ised by S@@ te@@ v@@ ens 's performance .
Refer@@ ring to different plac@@ es , which each time he m@@ ar@@ k@@ s on the m@@ a@@ p , he talks about the stories behind his m@@ e@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously and sub@@ t@@ ly con@@ tri@@ v@@ ed songs .
Where they or@@ ig@@ in@@ ated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
Since then S@@ te@@ v@@ ens has proved himself to be a w@@ on@@ der@@ fully creative n@@ ut@@ case .
His third album , " G@@ re@@ e@@ t@@ ings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , " released in 2003 , features c@@ le@@ v@@ er@@ ly composed songs which c@@ ling harmon@@ ically to the tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s of American folk ro@@ ck of the late six@@ ties , but which might dri@@ f@@ t at any time into am@@ a@@ z@@ ing op@@ ul@@ ence .
R@@ um@@ our has it that " Michigan " was the first part of a b@@ old series : it was to have been fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed by songs about each of the 50 United States .
But in 2004 in the Rh@@ ine area , " S@@ even S@@ w@@ ans " came out , bursting po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e expectations .
S@@ te@@ v@@ ens seems to have down@@ si@@ z@@ ed here .
P@@ l@@ ay@@ ing live he only ne@@ e@@ ds a guitar and b@@ an@@ jo .
One year later the New Y@@ or@@ k-@@ based m@@ u@@ si@@ cian returns to his series .
With " Illinois " ( " Su@@ f@@ jan S@@ te@@ v@@ ens In@@ v@@ it@@ es You To : C@@ o@@ m@@ e On F@@ e@@ el The I@@ l@@ l@@ in@@ o@@ ise " ) in 2005 , a wi@@ d@@ ely acclaimed m@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ piece is released .
Ex@@ u@@ b@@ er@@ ant with i@@ de@@ as and sty@@ li@@ st@@ ic s@@ op@@ h@@ i@@ st@@ i@@ c@@ ation .
The album clim@@ bs the American Bill@@ board char@@ ts and appears in every best album of the year list in the in@@ f@@ lu@@ en@@ ti@@ al music press .
After extremely p@@ ro@@ du@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ e e@@ x@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ s S@@ te@@ v@@ ens then serves up " The A@@ ge of Ad@@ z " ( 20@@ 10 ) , an elaborate el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic set piece .
This sixth p@@ ro@@ per studio album is still bro@@ ad@@ ly or@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ r@@ ated , but su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted by p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ ed sequ@@ en@@ ces or be@@ ats and plays with a v@@ ar@@ i@@ e@@ ty of effects and e@@ ch@@ o@@ es .
L@@ ong since mo@@ v@@ ed on from the s@@ m@@ aller c@@ lu@@ bs , the stage shows here are becoming col@@ o@@ ur@@ ful spec@@ t@@ ac@@ l@@ es with ne@@ on head@@ bands and huge f@@ lu@@ o@@ re@@ s@@ cent stage de@@ c@@ or@@ ations .
Currently Su@@ f@@ jan S@@ te@@ v@@ ens is to@@ ur@@ ing Germany as part of a fi@@ v@@ e-@@ man b@@ and .
Ham@@ bur@@ g M@@ e@@ h@@ r kept in the dark !
Since March the the@@ at@@ re has primarily presented " Carrie and L@@ ow@@ el@@ l . "
Although an audience of almost 2000 sit sp@@ ell@@ bo@@ un@@ d in their se@@ ats , the clearly more mature S@@ te@@ v@@ ens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and to folk .
Without direc@@ ting a word at the public the group of excellent m@@ u@@ si@@ cians plays through the wi@@ d@@ ely en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ed album .
From the audience one can hear : the performance is more " op@@ ul@@ ent " and it makes you want to " ch@@ u@@ ck away the album . "
Only with his en@@ core does S@@ te@@ v@@ ens give his mo@@ dest th@@ an@@ ks , play a few of his older songs ac@@ ou@@ st@@ ically and finally take a bo@@ w to th@@ un@@ der@@ ou@@ s a@@ p@@ pl@@ a@@ u@@ se .
J@@ er@@ em@@ y Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n to make debut at Prime Minister 's Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ on@@ s
Since his election , Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's debut at P@@ M@@ Q@@ s has been ke@@ enly a@@ wa@@ it@@ ed
New L@@ ab@@ our leader J@@ er@@ em@@ y Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n is to make his debut at Prime Minister 's Q@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ on@@ s later , taking on David C@@ am@@ er@@ on for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six al@@ lo@@ t@@ ted questions shortly after midday , with his performance likely to be closely sc@@ r@@ ut@@ in@@ ised by the media and L@@ ab@@ our MP@@ s .
He has called for " less the@@ at@@ re and more facts " at the weekly show@@ piece .
He has also said he could sk@@ i@@ p some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's leadership , coming after his a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment of a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w cabinet and his speech to the T@@ U@@ C annual con@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ s on Tuesday .
Me@@ an@@ while , the L@@ ab@@ our leader 's decision to st@@ and in silence during the s@@ in@@ g@@ ing of the national an@@ them at a service on Tuesday to mark the 7@@ 5@@ th anniversary of the B@@ attle of Britain has at@@ trac@@ ted criticism from a number of Tory MP@@ s and is the focus of several front p@@ age stories in the new@@ sp@@ a@@ p@@ ers .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's decision not to sing the national an@@ them has at@@ trac@@ ted attention
A spokesman for Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n said he had " st@@ ood in re@@ spec@@ t@@ ful silence " and did recognise the " her@@ o@@ ism of the Royal A@@ ir For@@ ce in the B@@ attle of Britain . "
But a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's s@@ ha@@ do@@ w cabinet , O@@ w@@ en Smith , told BBC Two 's News@@ night programme he would have ad@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ ed the L@@ ab@@ our leader to sing the national an@@ them " ir@@ re@@ spec@@ ti@@ v@@ e " of his belief that the m@@ on@@ ar@@ ch@@ y should be ab@@ ol@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ed .
Nearly a dozen s@@ ha@@ do@@ w ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's top team , citing differences over the economy , def@@ ence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally backed him as leader .
BBC political cor@@ re@@ sp@@ on@@ dent Rob@@ in B@@ rant says policy differences are also " st@@ ac@@ king up " within L@@ ab@@ our following Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment over its position on the European Union and the government 's c@@ a@@ p on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n told the T@@ U@@ C conference L@@ ab@@ our was putting forward am@@ en@@ d@@ ments to re@@ move the whole idea of a c@@ a@@ p al@@ together .
Ho@@ ur@@ s later Mr Smith , the s@@ ha@@ do@@ w work and pensions secretary , said the party was " very clear " that it was only op@@ po@@ s@@ ing government plans to reduce the level of c@@ a@@ p from £ 2@@ 6@@ ,000 to £ 2@@ 3@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n will be the fifth L@@ ab@@ our leader that David C@@ am@@ er@@ on has faced across the des@@ p@@ at@@ ch bo@@ x over the past de@@ c@@ a@@ de since he became Tory leader .
The L@@ ab@@ our leader , who has p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed a different approach to politics , says he has " crowd so@@ ur@@ c@@ ed " i@@ de@@ as for questions to ask Mr C@@ am@@ er@@ on and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
The I@@ s@@ l@@ in@@ g@@ ton North M@@ P has said P@@ M@@ Q@@ s is too con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ t@@ ational and that he will re@@ f@@ r@@ a@@ in from both " re@@ par@@ tee " and trading bar@@ bs , instead v@@ ow@@ ing to focus on serious issues such as po@@ v@@ er@@ ty , ine@@ quality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n has said that An@@ g@@ el@@ a E@@ ag@@ le , the s@@ ha@@ do@@ w business secretary , will de@@ p@@ ut@@ ise for him at P@@ M@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr C@@ am@@ er@@ on is tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ing abroad .
He has also flo@@ ated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the flo@@ or on o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ on , saying he had approached the Com@@ m@@ on@@ s S@@ pe@@ ak@@ er John B@@ er@@ co@@ w to discuss the issue .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr C@@ am@@ er@@ on said he wanted to move away from the " Pun@@ ch and J@@ ud@@ y " style of politics often associated with P@@ M@@ Q@@ s but ad@@ mit@@ ted some years later that he had failed .
Since it was first tel@@ e@@ v@@ ised in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 0 , P@@ M@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ ometer of a leader 's judgement , their com@@ m@@ and of the Com@@ m@@ on@@ s and their standing among their fellow MP@@ s although c@@ r@@ it@@ ics have ar@@ g@@ u@@ ed it has become a car@@ i@@ c@@ ature and is in need of f@@ ar@@ -@@ re@@ a@@ ch@@ ing re@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ s .

M@@ e@@ t@@ cash la@@ un@@ ches grassroots campaign to fight Al@@ d@@ i incur@@ si@@ on
M@@ e@@ t@@ cash is trying to protect its I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ d@@ i on@@ s@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ t in South Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a and Western Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a .
Gro@@ c@@ er@@ y w@@ h@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ er M@@ e@@ t@@ cash has k@@ i@@ c@@ ked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a and Western Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a ahead of a $ 7@@ 00 million Al@@ d@@ i in@@ v@@ a@@ si@@ on .
As Al@@ d@@ i pre@@ p@@ a@@ res to open two di@@ stri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on c@@ ent@@ res and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a and Western Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a early next year , M@@ e@@ t@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets are str@@ eng@@ th@@ en@@ ing rel@@ ation@@ ships with local food su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ ers and building the I@@ GA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the A@@ d@@ el@@ aide show .
I@@ GA retailers and su@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ ers are j@@ um@@ p@@ ing on board , with brands such as D@@ un@@ s@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh@@ -based i@@ c@@ e cream maker S@@ im@@ m@@ o 's off@@ er@@ ing ta@@ st@@ e testing at I@@ GA stores and store owners selling di@@ s@@ counted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers .
M@@ e@@ t@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its def@@ ence strategy on September 2@@ 9 , when the food , li@@ qu@@ or and hardware w@@ h@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ er h@@ o@@ st@@ s its annual in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ or strategy day .
There is much at stake , as South Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a and Western Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a account for almost 30 per cent of M@@ e@@ t@@ cash 's I@@ GA store footprint and gen@@ er@@ ate higher profit m@@ ar@@ g@@ ins than M@@ e@@ t@@ cash 's I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers are n@@ o@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ ously par@@ o@@ ch@@ ial and I@@ GA retailers enjoy a much str@@ on@@ ger market share than they do in N@@ S@@ W , V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ ia and Q@@ u@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land - more than 30 per cent in S@@ A and 24 per cent in W@@ A compared with around 14 per cent in the E@@ ast@@ er@@ n states .
However , an@@ al@@ y@@ st@@ s such as Morgan Stanley believe Al@@ d@@ i will s@@ n@@ are around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ing players but mainly from independent retailers .
In a report this week , Morgan Stanley an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ t Tom K@@ i@@ er@@ ath estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 3@@ 60 million a year in sales and M@@ e@@ t@@ cash $ 2@@ 50 million by the end of 20@@ 16 .
This fo@@ rec@@ ast is based on the assumption that Al@@ d@@ i opens 25 stores in S@@ A and 30 in W@@ A next year , gen@@ er@@ ating sales of $ 500 million and $ 6@@ 00 million in each market .
The loss of food and grocery sales and v@@ ol@@ um@@ es on M@@ e@@ t@@ cash 's high fix@@ ed-@@ cost base could cost M@@ e@@ t@@ cash around $ 13 million in e@@ ar@@ n@@ ings before interest and tax , Mr K@@ i@@ er@@ ath said .
At the same time , M@@ e@@ t@@ cash is lo@@ s@@ ing market share in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ d@@ i and Col@@ es , even though a recent Roy Morgan s@@ ur@@ v@@ ey found I@@ GA sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers were most loyal .
Morgan Stanley believes M@@ e@@ t@@ cash 's food and grocery sales will fall 3@@ .@@ 8 per cent in 20@@ 16 , 4.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 17 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in 20@@ 18 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 20@@ 15 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 20@@ 20 .
Last week , leading f@@ un@@ d manager Ham@@ ish D@@ ou@@ gl@@ ass , the founder of M@@ ag@@ ellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Mel@@ bo@@ ur@@ n@@ e that M@@ e@@ t@@ cash could " highly , probably disappear within a de@@ c@@ a@@ de .
M@@ e@@ t@@ cash has de@@ c@@ l@@ in@@ ed to respond p@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ly to Mr D@@ ou@@ gl@@ ass ' comments .
But it is understood that a M@@ e@@ t@@ cash board member con@@ t@@ acted Mr D@@ ou@@ gl@@ ass last week .
I@@ GA 's market share has f@@ all@@ en from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 20@@ 10 and e@@ ar@@ n@@ ings from M@@ e@@ t@@ cash 's food and grocery business , which supplies about 1@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have f@@ all@@ en 4@@ 3 per cent since 2012 , re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ting operating d@@ el@@ e@@ v@@ er@@ age as sales and m@@ ar@@ g@@ ins come under pressure .
However , the w@@ h@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ er is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching sh@@ el@@ f prices at Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , h@@ el@@ p@@ ing I@@ GA retailers refur@@ bish stores by adding f@@ ast@@ er-@@ growing fresh food , and ro@@ l@@ ling out a better range of private la@@ be@@ l gro@@ c@@ er@@ ies .
M@@ e@@ t@@ cash chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says the price matching and store refur@@ b@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ment programs are gaining tr@@ action and is hoping the w@@ h@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ er will return to un@@ der@@ l@@ y@@ ing profit growth in 20@@ 17 , for the first time in four years .

Th@@ an@@ as@@ i K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend N@@ ick K@@ y@@ r@@ g@@ i@@ os and des@@ er@@ ves k@@ u@@ do@@ s rather than criticism for his own be@@ ha@@ vi@@ our , according to T@@ en@@ n@@ is Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a president Steve H@@ e@@ al@@ y .
K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ o regularly re@@ fer@@ red to as the " Spec@@ ial K@@ s , " was d@@ r@@ ag@@ ged into an un@@ welcome sp@@ o@@ t@@ light by the in@@ fam@@ ou@@ s K@@ y@@ r@@ g@@ i@@ os sle@@ dge of St@@ an W@@ aw@@ r@@ in@@ ka at the Mon@@ tre@@ al M@@ ast@@ ers .
In a f@@ i@@ er@@ y qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ in@@ n@@ ati soon after , K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his op@@ p@@ on@@ ent R@@ y@@ an Harrison twice had to be se@@ par@@ ated by the chair ump@@ ir@@ e , with Harrison de@@ c@@ l@@ ar@@ ing : " W@@ aw@@ r@@ in@@ ka should 've de@@ ck@@ ed K@@ y@@ r@@ g@@ i@@ os , and I should de@@ ck that kid . "
While he was last seen s@@ m@@ ash@@ ing a r@@ ac@@ qu@@ et after cr@@ am@@ p fo@@ il@@ ed a potential US O@@ p@@ en u@@ p@@ set of R@@ ich@@ ar@@ d G@@ as@@ qu@@ et , K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ ak@@ is has been def@@ ended st@@ a@@ un@@ ch@@ ly by H@@ e@@ al@@ y .
The teenager is currently in G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w , competing with Sam Gro@@ th for the second s@@ in@@ g@@ l@@ es b@@ er@@ th behind B@@ er@@ n@@ ar@@ d T@@ o@@ m@@ ic in the Davis Cup se@@ m@@ i@@ -@@ final against Britain .
" One thing I do feel quite ke@@ enly about is I think Th@@ an@@ as@@ i 's been d@@ r@@ ag@@ ged into the f@@ r@@ a@@ y a little bit , " H@@ e@@ al@@ y said .
He did break a r@@ ac@@ qu@@ et when he lost when he cr@@ am@@ p@@ ed in the US , but he 's not the first player to break a r@@ ac@@ qu@@ et out of f@@ ru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ as@@ i well enough to know he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't be p@@ ro@@ ud of that .
But , really , he 's h@@ an@@ d@@ led himself extremely well , in pretty p@@ ro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on , and I think he des@@ er@@ ves a lot of credit .
He 's a great team around him , he 's got a great family around him and I just think he 's been a little hard done by .
He 's a very mature 19-year-old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he hasn 't ever had an issue with the other players , he 's well re@@ sp@@ ec@@ ted in the lo@@ ck@@ er room , he trains hard , he 's in great shape , he 's a very st@@ able and mature young guy and I just think he des@@ er@@ ves to be j@@ ud@@ ged on his own mer@@ its .
H@@ e@@ al@@ y also backed the decision to over@@ look K@@ y@@ r@@ g@@ i@@ os for the important ti@@ e , starting on Friday , des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ing the " mut@@ ual decision " as the right thing for all , but b@@ ac@@ king the C@@ an@@ b@@ er@@ ran to return as a long-term fix@@ t@@ ure in the team .
" First of all we want the team to be com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely focused on the ti@@ e and not all the controversy around [ K@@ y@@ r@@ g@@ i@@ os ] , " H@@ e@@ al@@ y said .
And I think N@@ ick , he 's r@@ i@@ s@@ en very quickly , as people like F@@ e@@ der@@ er and Mur@@ r@@ a@@ y have po@@ in@@ ted out , he 's growing up in the public eye and he 's made some ter@@ ri@@ ble errors and des@@ er@@ ves all the criticism he gets , but we 're trying to support him , we 're trying to help him understand the con@@ sequ@@ en@@ ces of his actions , and some time out of the li@@ m@@ el@@ ig@@ h@@ t where he can just re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t on that I think is appro@@ pri@@ ate and it 's best for the team and it 's best for him .
Europe mig@@ rant crisis : H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y de@@ c@@ la@@ res emergency , se@@ als border , de@@ ta@@ ins mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts
Dec@@ l@@ ar@@ ing a state of emergency , H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y sealed off its southern border with Ser@@ b@@ ia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally , aim@@ ing to shut down the flow of mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts po@@ uring in .
Cha@@ os en@@ sued at the border , as hundreds of mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts p@@ il@@ ed up in a no man 's land , and Ser@@ b@@ ian officials re@@ acted with ou@@ tr@@ age .
St@@ u@@ ck for an un@@ k@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ n amount of time on a stri@@ p of road between the two countries ' checkpoints , those f@@ le@@ e@@ ing viol@@ ence in their h@@ o@@ m@@ el@@ an@@ d@@ s p@@ it@@ ched t@@ ent@@ s and settled in .
But f@@ ru@@ str@@ ations were on the rise .
As a police helicopter h@@ o@@ v@@ er@@ ed above , mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts ch@@ an@@ ted " O@@ p@@ en the border ! " and sh@@ ou@@ ted in@@ su@@ l@@ ts at H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian ri@@ o@@ t police .
Some refused food and water in protest .
Ser@@ b@@ ia 's foreign minister de@@ c@@ la@@ red it was " un@@ acceptable " that mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts were being sent back from H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y while more and more were arriving from Mac@@ e@@ d@@ on@@ ia and G@@ re@@ e@@ ce .
( Ser@@ b@@ ia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , " I@@ v@@ i@@ c@@ a D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
The tur@@ mo@@ il at the H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian@@ -S@@ er@@ b@@ ian border came a day after the 28@@ -@@ nation blo@@ c failed to come up with a un@@ it@@ ed immigration policy at a con@@ ten@@ ti@@ ou@@ s meeting in Brussels .
The ministers did agree to share re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility for 40,000 people seeking re@@ f@@ u@@ ge in over@@ w@@ h@@ el@@ med I@@ tal@@ y and G@@ re@@ e@@ ce and spoke h@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly of re@@ a@@ ch@@ ing an event@@ ual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU n@@ ations would take 1@@ 20,000 more re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es , including some from H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y .
German Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or An@@ g@@ el@@ a M@@ er@@ k@@ el and Au@@ stri@@ a called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the con@@ t@@ in@@ ent 's immigration crisis .
H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y , however , was not p@@ inning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ ors .
Tuesday 's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up as@@ y@@ l@@ um court cases .
Me@@ an@@ while , H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ z@@ i@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said his country is also planning to build a r@@ a@@ z@@ or-@@ w@@ ir@@ e fence along part of its border with R@@ o@@ m@@ an@@ ia to stop the flow of mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts through the country , now that it has finished a fence on the Ser@@ b@@ ian border .
CBS News cor@@ re@@ sp@@ on@@ dent Charlie D '@@ A@@ g@@ at@@ a reported that even p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on in@@ mates were en@@ li@@ sted in the race to finish the r@@ a@@ z@@ or w@@ ir@@ e fence between H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y and Ser@@ b@@ ia .
In the last few months , H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y has become a major bott@@ l@@ en@@ eck and ent@@ ry point into the European Union for mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts , many of them war re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es from Syria and elsewhere in the M@@ id@@ d@@ le East .
Prime Minister V@@ i@@ k@@ tor Or@@ ban , however , has insisted that most arriving are economic mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts seeking a better life , not war re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es ent@@ it@@ led to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU n@@ ations , including Germany .
The new la@@ ws that took effect at midnight in H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y now make it a crime to c@@ ro@@ s@@ s or damage a 4@@ -@@ m@@ e@@ ter ( 13-@@ foot ) r@@ a@@ z@@ or-@@ w@@ ir@@ e fence the government has built along the southern border with Ser@@ b@@ ia and also includes longer p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on terms for con@@ v@@ i@@ c@@ ted human tra@@ f@@ f@@ ick@@ ers .
" D@@ ue to the situation caused by m@@ ass migration , the H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian government de@@ c@@ la@@ res a state of crisis , " government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ t@@ an Ko@@ vac@@ s told reporters in the southern city of S@@ z@@ eg@@ ed .
We are very clear on this : I@@ l@@ legal border c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing is a crime .
Te@@ ch@@ n@@ ically , par@@ li@@ am@@ ent must still appro@@ v@@ e the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
G@@ y@@ or@@ g@@ y B@@ ak@@ on@@ d@@ i , homeland security ad@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ er to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to c@@ ro@@ s@@ s at the border and 15 de@@ ep@@ er in the country .
They got across by d@@ am@@ ag@@ ing the fence , are now in police custody and are being charged with com@@ mit@@ ting off@@ en@@ s@@ es under the new la@@ ws .
Authorities are quickly re@@ p@@ airing the fence .
H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian officials also closed two of seven border c@@ ro@@ ss@@ ings with Ser@@ b@@ ia on Tuesday morning after de@@ plo@@ y@@ ing a train car co@@ v@@ er@@ ed with r@@ a@@ z@@ or w@@ ir@@ e to close one of them .
Cha@@ os en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ed the main border c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing near Ro@@ s@@ z@@ k@@ e , H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y , as the H@@ ung@@ ar@@ i@@ ans opened a tiny office in a metal con@@ ta@@ in@@ er to process people and crowds pressed to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze inside .
About 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts blocked the main high@@ way con@@ ne@@ c@@ ting Ser@@ b@@ ia and H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y , saying they were re@@ f@@ us@@ ing food and water until they are allowed to c@@ ro@@ s@@ s into H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y .
E@@ le@@ ction 20@@ 16 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over B@@ er@@ n@@ ie Sanders cut by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the n@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ation nation@@ ally , but Sen. B@@ er@@ n@@ ie Sanders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the b@@ ac@@ king of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 5@@ 8 percent ) , while Sanders comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ d@@ en , who has yet to an@@ n@@ o@@ un@@ ce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
More than five months before the start of the primary con@@ tests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their m@@ in@@ ds are made up about which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's b@@ ack@@ ers are more firm in their choice than those b@@ ac@@ king other candidates .
Since last month 's CBS News Pol@@ l , Clinton has lost ground among a number of de@@ mo@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ ic groups , while Sanders has made some g@@ ain@@ s .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and mo@@ der@@ at@@ es , but those le@@ ads have n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wed .
Her support among men has dropped con@@ si@@ der@@ ab@@ ly and Sanders only tra@@ il@@ s her by 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evapor@@ ated , and she and Sanders are now even .
However , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders by dou@@ ble@@ -@@ digits among liberals , but Sanders now has a 5-@@ point e@@ d@@ ge with this group .
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusi@@ ast@@ ically support Clinton if she became the party 's nominee .
A quarter would support her with some re@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee .
Six percent would not support her .
Per@@ ha@@ ps not s@@ ur@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ ingly , Clinton 's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusi@@ ast@@ ic about her .
V@@ i@@ e@@ ws are more m@@ i@@ x@@ ed among those not currently b@@ ac@@ king Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ ast@@ ically support her .
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusi@@ ast@@ ically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their f@@ r@@ on@@ tr@@ un@@ ner , D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p ( 35 percent ) .
When Clinton 's supporters are asked in an op@@ en@@ -@@ ended question why they want her to be the nominee , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed by it 's time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
A@@ g@@ re@@ em@@ ent on the issues , and el@@ ec@@ tability are also c@@ it@@ ed .
As the vice president w@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ s a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him j@@ um@@ p in the race - although a third don 't think he should .
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party 's n@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ation , Bi@@ d@@ en is the top p@@ ick .
Among Clinton supporters , more than half say Bi@@ d@@ en would be their second choice , far ahead of Sanders .
If Bi@@ d@@ en ch@@ oo@@ s@@ es not to run for the Democratic n@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ation , Hillary Clinton 's lead over Sanders wi@@ den@@ s , from 20 points with Bi@@ d@@ en in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
F@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ y-@@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ d@@ en is a di@@ st@@ ant second on this measure , but the per@@ c@@ ent@@ age that se@@ es him as the most el@@ ec@@ table has r@@ i@@ s@@ en .
Still , when asked which is more important in a nominee , Democratic voters p@@ ick issues over el@@ ec@@ tability .
S@@ im@@ il@@ ar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as un@@ acceptable as the nominee to these primary voters .
The Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ st@@ ics among their party 's primary voters .
Ma@@ j@@ or@@ it@@ i@@ es see Clinton , Sanders and Bi@@ d@@ en as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y and as having strong leadership qu@@ al@@ it@@ i@@ es .
Bi@@ d@@ en does the best of the three on hon@@ e@@ st@@ y , while Clinton 's strength is leadership .
Th@@ ir@@ ty percent of Democratic primary voters don 't think Clinton is hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y , twice as many as say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don 't have an opinion of him on this .
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , Sanders and Bi@@ d@@ en as in line with their vie@@ ws i@@ de@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ically .
On all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders .
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton 's use of a per@@ s@@ on@@ al em@@ a@@ il address and server while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are s@@ at@@ i@@ s@@ fied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn 't im@@ p@@ acted their overall vie@@ ws of her .
But it 's a different story among the American public overall .
Half of Americans are now di@@ s@@ s@@ at@@ i@@ s@@ fied with her explanation , while just about a third are s@@ at@@ i@@ s@@ fied .
The public 's vie@@ ws on this were sp@@ lit back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
Most Americans say the em@@ a@@ il controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has gro@@ w@@ n wor@@ se .
It is mainly Republicans , more than six in 10 , who say their vie@@ ws of Clinton have become wor@@ se .
Even though Clinton is vie@@ wed as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y by her party 's voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 3@@ 2 percent see her as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
S@@ i@@ x@@ t@@ y-@@ two percent of registered voters don 't think of her as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y .
At the same time , 5@@ 5 percent of registered voters nationwide don 't see T@@ ru@@ m@@ p as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ th@@ y either .
Both Clinton and T@@ ru@@ m@@ p , however , get good m@@ ar@@ k@@ s on leadership .
Of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ d@@ en , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on hon@@ e@@ st@@ y .
More see Sanders as hon@@ est than not , but like Car@@ son , many don 't have an opinion of him .
The margin of er@@ ro@@ r for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic primary voters is 6 per@@ c@@ ent@@ age points .

Ben Car@@ son is running close behind D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p in the new@@ est CBS News / New York Times poll
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others sc@@ ro@@ ung@@ ing for a f@@ oo@@ th@@ old
Republican voters nationwide continue to back T@@ ru@@ m@@ p in large numbers , clim@@ b@@ ing from 23 % support in the last CBS poll , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tuesday .
But Car@@ son ro@@ ck@@ eted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
The s@@ ur@@ v@@ ey also found Car@@ son doing well across de@@ mo@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ ic groups , e@@ d@@ ging out T@@ ru@@ m@@ p among c@@ olle@@ g@@ e@@ -@@ e@@ du@@ c@@ ated Republican voters .
The rest of the field , with the e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ on of Car@@ ly F@@ i@@ or@@ in@@ a and Ohio Gov. John K@@ a@@ si@@ ch , has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. S@@ co@@ t@@ t Wal@@ ker f@@ all@@ ing far@@ th@@ est from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
Former Florida Gov. J@@ e@@ b Bush , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Mar@@ co R@@ u@@ b@@ io all ti@@ ed for third place with 6 % .
The margin of er@@ ro@@ r for the 37@@ 6-@@ person sample of Republican voters in this new@@ est poll is pl@@ us-@@ or-@@ minus 6 % , and was conducted Sept .
The latest C@@ N@@ N / OR@@ C s@@ ur@@ v@@ ey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the polls -- landing at 19 % support among Republicans , behind T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's 3@@ 2 % support .
The latest poll from ABC News / Washington Post also showed T@@ ru@@ m@@ p si@@ gn@@ ific@@ an@@ t@@ ly ahead of Car@@ son .
Facing a rising Car@@ son last week , T@@ ru@@ m@@ p took some po@@ t@@ shots at the re@@ ti@@ red ne@@ u@@ ro@@ surgeon , even as Car@@ son a@@ p@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ z@@ ed for questioning T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's f@@ a@@ it@@ h .

F@@ i@@ v@@ e f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity members charged in death of Bar@@ u@@ ch College fresh@@ man
Nearly two years after a college student died during a f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity ha@@ z@@ ing r@@ it@@ ual in Pennsylvania 's Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
Members of New York City 's Bar@@ u@@ ch College P@@ i D@@ el@@ t@@ a P@@ si f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity brut@@ ally as@@ s@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ ted Ch@@ u@@ n " Michael " Den@@ g during an in@@ it@@ i@@ ation r@@ it@@ e in September 20@@ 13 and d@@ el@@ ay@@ ed taking him to the hospital , con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ ing to his death , police said .
O@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ als said he was b@@ l@@ in@@ d@@ fol@@ ded , sa@@ ddled with a 30-@@ pound b@@ ack@@ p@@ ac@@ k full of sand , and repeatedly t@@ ac@@ k@@ l@@ ed while he tried to walk toward a target across a f@@ ro@@ zen field .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually complained that his head hurt then fell un@@ con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s .
P@@ i D@@ el@@ t@@ a P@@ si f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity members did not call 911 after Den@@ g passed out , and al@@ le@@ g@@ e@@ d@@ ly wa@@ it@@ ed an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
They did , however , find time to change Den@@ g 's clothes , G@@ oo@@ g@@ le his sy@@ mp@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ s , and con@@ t@@ act Andy M@@ en@@ g , the f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity 's national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference .
" At this point , members began to hi@@ de par@@ a@@ p@@ her@@ n@@ al@@ i@@ a and basically put the f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity 's w@@ ell@@ -@@ being over that of Michael Den@@ g 's , " Chief W@@ ag@@ ner said .
He could not be revived and he died the next morning .
According to an a@@ u@@ t@@ op@@ s@@ y report , Den@@ g was sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ted to re@@ pe@@ ated b@@ l@@ unt force tr@@ a@@ u@@ m@@ a to his head , t@@ or@@ so , and th@@ ig@@ h@@ s .
" T@@ o@@ o many families have been devastated as a result of f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity ha@@ z@@ ing , with at least one student d@@ y@@ ing every year from ha@@ z@@ ing since 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 0 , " D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as F@@ i@@ er@@ berg , an att@@ or@@ ne@@ y representing Den@@ g 's family , said in a statement .
F@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ it@@ i@@ es and their members must be held ac@@ co@@ un@@ table , and this step by authorities is an important one .
A Mon@@ ro@@ e County grand jury recommended th@@ ir@@ d@@ -@@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y-@@ two other f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity members , including Mr. M@@ en@@ g , will also be charged with assault ha@@ z@@ ing and criminal conspiracy .
" We want to hold not only the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als involved , but if there 's an organization that s@@ anc@@ ti@@ on@@ ed it , whether officially or un@@ officially , we 're going to hold them ac@@ co@@ un@@ table as well , " W@@ ag@@ ner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ u@@ ch College banned the f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity and the national f@@ r@@ at@@ ern@@ ity re@@ vo@@ ked its aff@@ ili@@ ation with the local ch@@ a@@ p@@ ter .
Here 's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike will come and the bul@@ l market will st@@ um@@ ble , bond y@@ i@@ el@@ ds will clim@@ b and the economy will sli@@ p into a recession .
This we know .
What we don 't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
For the economy specifically , history offers little g@@ u@@ i@@ de about timing .
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
The Federal Reserve 's ag@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ si@@ ven@@ ess in raising rates is often , though not always , a de@@ ter@@ m@@ in@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
That 's why officials at the U.S. central b@@ an@@ k have stressed so v@@ ig@@ or@@ ously that in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ t@@ or@@ y of how long it will take to n@@ or@@ m@@ al@@ i@@ ze .
There are , in@@ de@@ ed , mul@@ ti@@ p@@ le v@@ ar@@ i@@ ab@@ l@@ es at play .
In the end , however , market parti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ an@@ ts may find that all the r@@ at@@ e-@@ hike f@@ us@@ s may have been over@@ done .
" The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ ab@@ ly be inter@@ pre@@ ted by some as si@@ gn@@ aling the end of the era of ' ch@@ e@@ a@@ p money , ' " Ju@@ li@@ an J@@ es@@ so@@ p , chief global e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ist at Capital E@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ics , said in a note to clients .
In con@@ tr@@ ast , we do not expect the g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ al return of U.S. interest rates to more n@@ or@@ m@@ al but still low levels to be the se@@ i@@ s@@ m@@ ic sh@@ o@@ ck that many seem to fear .
That 's not to say there won 't be effects , however .
Here 's a look at how some areas of the economy could re@@ act , based on historical trends :
As the market has seen over the past month or so , an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ation of rate h@@ i@@ k@@ es can make things v@@ ol@@ at@@ ile for a while .
Once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
" It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to st@@ all 1@@ 2@@ -@@ 24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the la@@ g in m@@ on@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y policy , " De@@ ut@@ s@@ ch@@ e Bank an@@ al@@ y@@ st@@ s said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed h@@ i@@ k@@ es .
More specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 2@@ 50 days after ( average gain of 2.@@ 6 percent ) then back to n@@ or@@ m@@ al once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cyc@@ l@@ es of 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 4 percent , according to a recent an@@ al@@ y@@ sis Bo@@ b D@@ ol@@ l , chief equity str@@ at@@ eg@@ ist at N@@ u@@ ve@@ en A@@ s@@ set Management , posted on Bar@@ r@@ on 's .
De@@ ut@@ s@@ ch@@ e said the impact on stocks tends to get more p@@ r@@ on@@ oun@@ c@@ ed later in the r@@ at@@ e-@@ hi@@ king c@@ y@@ c@@ le and returns begin to di@@ m@@ in@@ ish .
Rec@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ s are a fact of economic life , but rate h@@ i@@ k@@ es often help them along .
In the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could ha@@ st@@ en a recession .
Most n@@ o@@ t@@ ab@@ ly , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike .
According to De@@ ut@@ s@@ ch@@ e Bank , in the 1@@ 18 rate h@@ i@@ k@@ es since 1@@ 9@@ 50 , only twice has n@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ al year over year GD@@ P been below 4.@@ 5 percent .
Even though the second quarter of 20@@ 15 was at 3@@ .@@ 6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter trac@@ king at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Hi@@ king rates into such a f@@ r@@ ag@@ ile economic b@@ ack@@ drop could be risky and set up the question of " whether this time is different , " De@@ ut@@ s@@ ch@@ e said .
Mark@@ et parti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ an@@ ts have been b@@ r@@ acing for a Fed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week 's Federal O@@ p@@ en Mark@@ et Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
While many strategists and e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ists believe the F@@ O@@ M@@ C could appro@@ v@@ e a hike at this meeting , futures trading in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ es just a 25 percent p@@ ro@@ b@@ ability .
" In our study since 1@@ 9@@ 50 , all hi@@ king cyc@@ l@@ es to date have been in a su@@ per c@@ y@@ c@@ le of increasing le@@ v@@ er@@ age with GD@@ P ec@@ li@@ p@@ sing p@@ r@@ er@@ ec@@ es@@ si@@ on peaks very quickly post the recovery com@@ men@@ c@@ ing , " the report said .
By con@@ tr@@ ast this has been a uniquely s@@ low recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
The current c@@ y@@ c@@ le is by far the l@@ on@@ g@@ es@@ t the Fed has wa@@ it@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and co@@ un@@ ting .
F@@ i@@ x@@ ed income also has been v@@ ol@@ at@@ ile as the market an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ at@@ es a rate hike , and the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n is somewhat similar to what e@@ qu@@ it@@ i@@ es experience .
The principal di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
For bonds , it does seem y@@ i@@ el@@ ds change direction immediately as the first hike / cut in the c@@ y@@ c@@ le ar@@ ri@@ ves .
At the end of the hi@@ king c@@ y@@ c@@ le bond y@@ i@@ el@@ ds fall immediately , " De@@ ut@@ s@@ ch@@ e said .
Charles S@@ ch@@ w@@ ab strategists believe the hike in rates will cause y@@ i@@ el@@ ds between l@@ on@@ ger@@ - and shor@@ ter@@ -@@ d@@ ated bonds to move closer together , flat@@ ten@@ ing the cur@@ v@@ e .
H@@ ig@@ h@@ -@@ y@@ i@@ el@@ d bonds often perform better in such a climate , though " we are still cautious about stre@@ t@@ ching for y@@ i@@ el@@ d , " K@@ a@@ th@@ y Jones , fi@@ x@@ ed income an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ t at S@@ ch@@ w@@ ab , said in an an@@ al@@ y@@ sis .
In@@ ter@@ e@@ st@@ ingly , Jones th@@ in@@ ks m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
" In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjust@@ ed to the prospect of ti@@ gh@@ ter m@@ on@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y policy , " she wrote .
Sh@@ or@@ t@@ -@@ term interest rates are up , the y@@ i@@ el@@ d cur@@ v@@ e is flat@@ ter , credit sp@@ read@@ s have wi@@ den@@ ed and v@@ ol@@ at@@ ility has increased - all char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ st@@ ics of the market when the Fed ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ s policy .
B@@ ro@@ ad@@ ly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
M@@ ul@@ t@@ in@@ ation@@ als with lo@@ ts of debt will fare wor@@ se , as a rising dollar makes their products more e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e in the global market sp@@ ace and their debt more e@@ x@@ p@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e the finance .
" History shows that ' quality ' stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hike , " Goldman Sachs an@@ al@@ y@@ st@@ s said in a report for clients .
F@@ ir@@ ms with strong balance sh@@ e@@ ets out@@ p@@ ac@@ ed w@@ e@@ ak balance sh@@ e@@ et companies following each of the 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 , 1999 , and 2004 rate h@@ i@@ k@@ es , by an average of 5 per@@ c@@ ent@@ age points .
Compan@@ ies with high returns on capital as well as low v@@ ol@@ at@@ ility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counter@@ parts , by an average of 4 ( per@@ c@@ ent@@ age points ) and 3 ( per@@ c@@ ent@@ age points ) , respectively .
D@@ e@@ b@@ t will become a big issue .
Compan@@ ies with a high per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of flo@@ ating rate debt st@@ and to lose the most , Goldman said .
Outside p@@ ure stock plays , consumers st@@ and to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
S@@ a@@ v@@ er@@ s could see g@@ ain@@ s as well through higher y@@ i@@ el@@ ds at the , though experts di@@ f@@ f@@ er on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a cop@@ y of C@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ c F@@ M says M@@ P Andre@@ w B@@ in@@ g@@ ham
Con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ative M@@ P Andre@@ w B@@ in@@ g@@ ham c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ised station for ' d@@ um@@ b@@ ing down@@ '
Ar@@ gues it 's becoming increasingly in@@ distingu@@ i@@ s@@ hab@@ le from commercial rival
Also took a@@ im at the BBC Mu@@ si@@ c A@@ war@@ ds , saying they just ri@@ p off the B@@ r@@ its
C@@ olle@@ ag@@ ue D@@ am@@ i@@ en Collins M@@ P attacked The V@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ e , saying that too wasn 't original
BBC Radio 3 is " turning into " C@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ c F@@ M , a leading M@@ P has claimed , p@@ il@@ ing fresh pressure on the bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ er to prove that it does something that commercial bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ers do not .
Con@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ ative M@@ P Andre@@ w B@@ in@@ g@@ ham also told BBC bo@@ s@@ s@@ es that the public service r@@ a@@ di@@ o station appeared to be " d@@ um@@ b@@ ing down " and is becoming increasingly in@@ distingu@@ i@@ s@@ hab@@ le from its commercial rival .
" Radio 3 seems to be - I don 't like to use the word " d@@ um@@ b@@ ing down " - but it seems to be turning into C@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ c F@@ M , " he said .
He also took a@@ im at the BBC Mu@@ si@@ c A@@ war@@ ds , launched last December .
The BBC Mu@@ si@@ c A@@ war@@ ds which started last year seem to be the B@@ r@@ its by another name .
So , if you 're trying to do something different - those are two e@@ x@@ am@@ pl@@ es from the top of my head where you 're actually just mim@@ i@@ c@@ king what is already on the market , " Mr B@@ in@@ g@@ ham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , ar@@ g@@ u@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and e@@ du@@ c@@ ating the public .
What I le@@ ar@@ n from Radio 3 , I am not going to le@@ ar@@ n about c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ cal music from an@@ y@@ where else .
And it 's com@@ mit@@ ment to live music and music making is actually second to n@@ one .
" And also , Radio 3 's com@@ mit@@ ment to finding new music and com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ing new works I think is also really important , " he said .
Earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 con@@ tro@@ l@@ ler Alan D@@ av@@ ey ar@@ g@@ u@@ ed that it has to work har@@ der to eng@@ age audiences than it did in the past , because B@@ r@@ it@@ on@@ s are less e@@ du@@ c@@ ated about c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ cal music .
However , Radio 3 was not the only el@@ em@@ ent of the BBC 's output which came under fire for tre@@ ad@@ ing on the to@@ es of commercial ri@@ v@@ als , during the Cul@@ t@@ ure , Media and Sport select com@@ mit@@ tee hearing .
Tory M@@ P D@@ am@@ i@@ en Collins attacked The V@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ e - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from D@@ ut@@ ch producer Tal@@ p@@ a Media at an estimated cost of £ 2@@ 2@@ million .
C@@ an you see why that programme is often di@@ sc@@ us@@ s@@ ed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
L@@ or@@ d Hall insisted that the BB@@ C@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma F@@ a@@ it@@ h and Bo@@ y George as j@@ ud@@ g@@ es - was produced " in a particularly BBC way . "
He added that he wants the Corporation to " find a hit from our own in-@@ h@@ ou@@ se st@@ able " next time it la@@ un@@ ches an entertainment series .
However , he refused to rule out or@@ der@@ ing more series of The V@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ e in the future , or spending lic@@ ence fe@@ e p@@ ay@@ ers ' money on other entertainment f@@ or@@ m@@ ats .
Internet sales increased at s@@ lo@@ w@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to b@@ l@@ am@@ e
First three months of 20@@ 15 saw seven per cent increase in online sales

On@@ line sales bol@@ st@@ er@@ ed three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November 's Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a de@@ c@@ a@@ de v@@ ir@@ tu@@ al shopping has been bo@@ o@@ m@@ ing and turning many of Britain 's high streets into g@@ host towns .
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are le@@ v@@ el@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 20@@ 15 .
T@@ o@@ t@@ al spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
Experts say there are signs that online sales are le@@ v@@ el@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 20@@ 15
'@@ If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to r@@ ation@@ al@@ ise over time , ' Andy M@@ ul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , e@@ d@@ itor of I@@ M@@ R@@ G sales index , told the Guar@@ di@@ an .
He e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed that online sales were bol@@ st@@ er@@ ed three years ago when sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers started us@@ ing their mobile ph@@ on@@ es to make pur@@ ch@@ as@@ es .
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different con@@ te@@ x@@ ts , such as on the so@@ f@@ a .
But now that is pl@@ at@@ e@@ a@@ u@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
The Black Friday ph@@ en@@ o@@ m@@ en@@ on , which has been im@@ p@@ or@@ ted from America , is being c@@ it@@ ed as one of the re@@ as@@ on@@ s behind the s@@ lo@@ w@@ ing sales .
Experts believe sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers could be holding off making pur@@ ch@@ as@@ es ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers flo@@ ck@@ ed to their computers to snap up deals cr@@ ash@@ ing a number of retailers websites .
Experts believe Black Friday , which saw sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers fight over bar@@ g@@ ain@@ s , could be holding sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers off from making pur@@ ch@@ as@@ es
Research published by the British Retail Con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
For some products , such as T@@ V@@ s and w@@ ash@@ ing machines , more than one third of pur@@ ch@@ as@@ es are now done through w@@ e@@ b stores .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than us@@ ing high stre@@ et fashion chains .
Muslims bur@@ y those killed in M@@ ec@@ ca c@@ r@@ an@@ e crash as B@@ in Laden family s@@ anc@@ ti@@ on@@ ed

D@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ ed largely in white , mo@@ ur@@ n@@ ers p@@ ack@@ ed the rou@@ te to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-@@ Mo@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ se@@ m c@@ em@@ e@@ ter@@ y .
The sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction c@@ r@@ an@@ e cr@@ ashed through the ceiling of the mosque and t@@ op@@ pled onto wor@@ sh@@ i@@ p@@ ers .
The bodies were released for f@@ un@@ er@@ al as the Saudi King s@@ anc@@ ti@@ on@@ ed the B@@ in Laden family con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction group over the di@@ sa@@ ster , which also left 3@@ 9@@ 4 injured .

Among the dead was f@@ a@@ th@@ er@@ -@@ o@@ f@@ -@@ four Q@@ a@@ si@@ m Ak@@ r@@ a@@ m , from Bol@@ ton , G@@ re@@ ater M@@ an@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ er , who was on his first p@@ il@@ g@@ ri@@ m@@ age when the c@@ r@@ an@@ e cr@@ ashed down .
Mr Ak@@ r@@ a@@ m had been in the Gr@@ and Mo@@ s@@ que with his parents ahead of the start of the annual ha@@ j@@ j p@@ il@@ g@@ ri@@ m@@ age .
Saudi officials have already vowed that the ha@@ j@@ j to M@@ ec@@ ca will go ahead with thousands continuing to des@@ c@@ end on the city .
Today , King Salman said the B@@ in@@ l@@ ad@@ in Group should not have left the c@@ r@@ an@@ e 's arm up when it was not in use .
An Arab@@ ic version of the de@@ c@@ ree , carried by the st@@ at@@ e-@@ run Saudi Press Agency , said the B@@ in@@ l@@ ad@@ in Group was partly to b@@ l@@ am@@ e for the collapse .
The news agency 's English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ing abroad .
Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the c@@ r@@ an@@ e to topple into a cour@@ t@@ y@@ ar@@ d of the Gr@@ and Mo@@ s@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have con@@ v@@ er@@ ged ahead of the ha@@ j@@ j p@@ il@@ g@@ ri@@ m@@ age later this month .
B@@ in@@ l@@ ad@@ in Group has not released any statements about the c@@ r@@ an@@ e collapse and its re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ at@@ i@@ ves have not been made available for comment .
The royal de@@ c@@ ree also blamed the group for not us@@ ing u@@ p@@ -@@ to-@@ date safety measures and failing to co@@ ordin@@ ate with m@@ e@@ te@@ or@@ ological officials .
Do@@ z@@ ens of c@@ r@@ an@@ es surround M@@ ec@@ ca 's Gr@@ and Mo@@ s@@ que , part of the massive con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction effort head@@ ed by the B@@ in@@ l@@ ad@@ in Group .
The B@@ in@@ l@@ ad@@ in family has been close to Saudi Arab@@ ia 's r@@ ul@@ ing family for decades and runs major building projects .
Al Q@@ a@@ ida 's late leader Os@@ ama bin Laden was a ren@@ eg@@ a@@ de son di@@ s@@ owned by the family in the 1990s .

Because B@@ r@@ it@@ on@@ s are increasingly em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ing h@@ an@@ d@@ y@@ men to carry out DI@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the bo@@ s@@ s of the company behind B & Q .
V@@ er@@ on@@ i@@ que L@@ a@@ u@@ ry , new chief executive of K@@ in@@ g@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ her , which ow@@ n@@ s the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of sk@@ ill@@ ed tra@@ des@@ men from E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Europe off@@ er@@ ing services at ro@@ ck-@@ bo@@ t@@ to@@ m prices is behind the trend .
As a result , K@@ in@@ g@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ her is planning to open 200 more S@@ c@@ re@@ w@@ fi@@ x stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , while c@@ lo@@ s@@ ing 60 B & Q out@@ lets .
M@@ r@@ s L@@ a@@ u@@ ry said she wants more women to be employed in B & Q shops because eight out of ten pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing de@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on@@ s in store are made by the f@@ a@@ ir@@ er se@@ x .
Currently the majority of staff are men .
She said there was a need to address growing de@@ mo@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ ic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
M@@ r@@ s L@@ a@@ u@@ ry said : " We still have a majority of men working in our stores .
We need to move more towards a balance .
F@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ ally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the de@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on@@ s over items pur@@ ch@@ ased taken by women .
W@@ o@@ m@@ en play a big part in the de@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on-@@ making process .
M@@ r@@ s L@@ a@@ u@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the h@@ el@@ m of Britain 's F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also re@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tu@@ red her top team to re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t an e@@ qu@@ al number of men and women direc@@ tors .
K@@ in@@ g@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ her is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team st@@ aff@@ ed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
M@@ r@@ s L@@ a@@ u@@ ry said : " This was a con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s decision - diversity is an important t@@ op@@ ic here .
It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
K@@ in@@ g@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ her posted a fall in both hal@@ f@@ -@@ year profit and sales after the group sh@@ oul@@ der@@ ed the cost of sh@@ ut@@ ting stores .
As a result of the trend K@@ in@@ g@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ her , which ow@@ n@@ s S@@ c@@ re@@ w@@ fi@@ x and B & Q , is opening 200 new stores
O@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ als from A@@ ich@@ -@@ D@@ o@@ b in court for bre@@ a@@ ch of trust
Two officials from the Au@@ stri@@ an v@@ olle@@ y@@ ball r@@ un@@ ner@@ -@@ up ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion team A@@ ich@@ -@@ D@@ o@@ b attended the K@@ l@@ ag@@ en@@ f@@ urt regional court on Wednesday to answer charges of bre@@ a@@ ch of trust and tax e@@ v@@ a@@ si@@ on .
The def@@ en@@ d@@ an@@ ts pleaded not guilty .
One of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position .
He was le@@ g@@ ally ac@@ qu@@ it@@ ted of this charge in May .
The current case was ad@@ jo@@ ur@@ ned .
According to senior Public Pro@@ se@@ c@@ ut@@ or Robert Ri@@ f@@ f@@ el , it em@@ er@@ g@@ ed during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 20@@ 11 the def@@ en@@ d@@ an@@ ts used m@@ on@@ ies from the club 's accounts , to which they had access due to their roles , for private pur@@ po@@ s@@ es .
The loss is estimated at around € 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 .
The sp@@ or@@ ts officials are also accused of financial off@@ en@@ ces .
The Cha@@ ir@@ woman of the L@@ ay Judge Senate , Judge M@@ ich@@ a@@ el@@ a San@@ in , ordered p@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ ings on this fact to be post@@ p@@ on@@ ed .
It will be tried at a later date .
On the charge of bre@@ a@@ ch of trust , the def@@ ence ar@@ g@@ u@@ ed that the club had never at any time suffered any p@@ ec@@ uni@@ ar@@ y di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age
The sp@@ or@@ ts officials had only off@@ set expense al@@ lo@@ w@@ ances , and brought the sp@@ or@@ ts club for which they worked from 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 to 20@@ 11 , and in which they had invested much time and money , out of debt - li@@ ab@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ es in 2001 am@@ oun@@ ted to around 600,000 S@@ ch@@ ill@@ ings ( around € 44@@ ,000 ) .
" At that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down , " said one of the def@@ en@@ d@@ ent@@ s , who makes his living as an a@@ u@@ d@@ it@@ or of large companies for the tax authorities .
With his c@@ olle@@ ag@@ ue and co@@ -@@ def@@ en@@ d@@ ant , he had then re@@ sol@@ v@@ ed to un@@ der@@ take this t@@ ask .
With all the risks .
" We advanced money and de@@ po@@ s@@ it@@ ed our life insurance po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es with the b@@ an@@ k as security , " he said during the e@@ x@@ am@@ in@@ ation .
It was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to man@@ age the money , but they were not per@@ mit@@ ted to run up any de@@ b@@ ts .
Furthermore , if there was appro@@ pri@@ ate financial success , re@@ tro@@ spec@@ ti@@ v@@ e payment of the expense al@@ lo@@ w@@ ance back to 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 1 was agreed .
As a result , a part of the expense al@@ lo@@ w@@ ance was paid off years later , that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit .
This is why general and not detailed de@@ b@@ it ent@@ ries appeared , was the former chairman 's explanation for the p@@ ro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ es .
The two def@@ en@@ d@@ an@@ ts managed the accounts and pass@@ b@@ oo@@ ks together , said the second def@@ en@@ d@@ ant .
The Judge asked why the payments had not been di@@ sc@@ lo@@ s@@ ed to the club in detail .
The club was not interested in details of the financial ar@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ e@@ m@@ ent@@ s , it was only important that it should be debt free , was the answer .
When investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 20@@ 11 , a su@@ m of € 1@@ 20,000 was trans@@ fer@@ red into the club 's account .
Those were re@@ serves , e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed the def@@ en@@ d@@ ant .
This se@@ cur@@ it@@ i@@ es account was run in the name of the two def@@ en@@ d@@ an@@ ts and according to a statement by the club its e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ence was not known to the club .
" W@@ h@@ y ? " the Judge wanted to know .
There was no answer to this for a long time .
Th@@ en he finally said that he had th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t it would be best for the club .
Had something happen to him then n@@ o@@ body would have known anything about this money , the State Pro@@ se@@ c@@ ut@@ or put to the room .
The co@@ -@@ def@@ en@@ d@@ ant knew about it , the official j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ fied himself .
The pur@@ po@@ se of the transfer was given as com@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ation for damages .
" W@@ h@@ y com@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ation for damages ? " the Judge and the State Pro@@ se@@ c@@ ut@@ or wanted to know .
In response , the first def@@ en@@ d@@ ant said that he had di@@ sag@@ re@@ ed with this wor@@ ding because no damage had ever occurred to the club .
But what can I do when the lawyer says , " This lets us all off the hook " ?
" A@@ m I a legal re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ ative ? " he asked .
The official carried on that he had never received a cent in sal@@ ar@@ y , he had only charged for m@@ il@@ e@@ age and a per di@@ e@@ m al@@ lo@@ w@@ ance .
The club had set aside € 1,000 per month for per di@@ e@@ m al@@ lo@@ w@@ ances , which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher , he added .
The def@@ en@@ d@@ an@@ ts were not able to provide ac@@ c@@ ur@@ ate doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ation for the earlier years .
This was no longer kept since an a@@ u@@ dit in which everything was properly assessed , they e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed .
The second def@@ en@@ d@@ ant had also ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed a m@@ il@@ e@@ age al@@ lo@@ w@@ ance .
All adjust@@ ments were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his home in V@@ ö@@ l@@ k@@ er@@ m@@ ar@@ k@@ t to the b@@ an@@ k in B@@ l@@ e@@ i@@ bur@@ g , he e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed in his statement .
The trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of w@@ it@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ es .
H@@ e@@ wle@@ t@@ t P@@ ack@@ ar@@ d c@@ ut@@ ting a further 30,000 jobs
In addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years , the computer g@@ i@@ ant is going to l@@ ay off even more staff with the splitting of the company .
There seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer g@@ i@@ ant H@@ e@@ wle@@ tt@@ -P@@ ack@@ ar@@ d ( H@@ P ) .
As part of its re@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tur@@ ing , the US technology group plans to l@@ ay off between 25,000 and 30,000 staff in its cor@@ p@@ or@@ ate customer section .
This should lead to cost savings of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) , the company di@@ sc@@ lo@@ s@@ ed on Tuesday .
The step will lead to a one-@@ off charge of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion , which will be incur@@ red in the fourth quarter .
The re@@ du@@ c@@ ti@@ on of 5@@ 5,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed .
At the end of the 20@@ 13 / 14 business year H@@ P still employed around 3@@ 0@@ 2,000 staff .
At the end of trading H@@ e@@ wle@@ tt@@ -P@@ ack@@ ar@@ d shares had f@@ all@@ en by 2.@@ 3 percent .
The group based in Pal@@ o Al@@ to , California , which initially grew through its p@@ r@@ in@@ ter sales , is currently splitting its business : this year the computer and p@@ r@@ in@@ ter side will be combined in a new company , se@@ par@@ ated from the the p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ing areas of computer s@@ er@@ v@@ er@@ s and data st@@ or@@ age for business as well as other services .
Both operations will be li@@ sted on the stock exchange .
Re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ d@@ ly disappointing sales of P@@ C@@ s as well as a s@@ low demand from business customers for their services have recently aff@@ lic@@ ted the world 's second-largest PC man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er after Len@@ o@@ v@@ o .
In the third fiscal quarter to the end of July , sales of P@@ C@@ s and p@@ r@@ inter@@ s fell by 1@@ 1.@@ 5 percent .
Re@@ ven@@ ue dropped by eight percent to just under $ 25@@ .@@ 4 billion .
This m@@ e@@ ans profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters .
H@@ P responded to the changes in the industry with a sp@@ lit and massive l@@ ay@@ offs .
The 76@@ -year-old business head@@ ed by Me@@ g W@@ h@@ it@@ man has been s@@ low to re@@ act to the rise in customers buying s@@ m@@ ar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ es and t@@ ab@@ lets instead of con@@ ven@@ tional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online .
W@@ h@@ it@@ man 's plans for re@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tur@@ ing include around 5@@ 5,000 job losses .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ ts : the majority support anti I@@ S@@ I@@ S training mission
The majority of people , however , are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in com@@ b@@ at operations in Iraq : 54 percent were against it , 35 percent have expressed themselves in favour .
S@@ i@@ x@@ t@@ y-@@ one percent re@@ acted po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ely to other countries carrying out air att@@ ac@@ ks against I@@ S@@ I@@ S in Iraq and Syria .
T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ four percent are against inter@@ ven@@ ing in the con@@ fli@@ c@@ t .
F@@ i@@ f@@ t@@ y-@@ one percent of those surveyed are against co@@ operating with the Sy@@ ri@@ an ruler B@@ ash@@ ar al-@@ A@@ s@@ sad , but 20 percent were in favour .
T@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ nine percent were un@@ decided .

R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ k@@ e : out@@ break of viol@@ ence on the Ser@@ b@@ i@@ an-@@ H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian border
The H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian police have used tear gas and water cann@@ on@@ s against several hundred an@@ g@@ r@@ y re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es on the Ser@@ b@@ ian border near R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ k@@ e .
E@@ ur@@ on@@ e@@ ws cor@@ re@@ sp@@ on@@ dent D@@ án@@ i@@ e@@ l Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k w@@ it@@ n@@ essed the out@@ break of viol@@ ence at the border control point .
He reported by tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one :
A group of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es broke through the border .
A line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water cann@@ on st@@ ood at the read@@ y .
Between 40 and 50 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es started to throw st@@ on@@ es , st@@ icks and pl@@ ast@@ ic bottles at the officers .
At first the officers used a con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ou@@ s spra@@ y of pepper spra@@ y .
Th@@ en the police used tear gas .
A lot of tear gas was spra@@ y@@ ed in the direction of the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
This caused the group to break up .
The group has now re@@ lu@@ c@@ t@@ an@@ t@@ ly wi@@ th@@ drawn .
A pre@@ gn@@ ant and ob@@ vi@@ ously injured woman has been carried away from the area .

Dec@@ i@@ s@@ ion time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve m@@ e@@ ets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a de@@ c@@ a@@ de .
A s@@ ur@@ v@@ ey of 80 e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ists p@@ ol@@ l@@ ed by Reuters found a little over half who only last week th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-@@ 0.@@ 25 percent range .
It 's a historical event because it 's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zer@@ o .
For the first time we are appro@@ a@@ ch@@ ing a situation where a major central b@@ an@@ k might be able to get out of the zer@@ o bar and start a process of n@@ or@@ m@@ alization of interest rates , " said An@@ g@@ e@@ l U@@ b@@ i@@ de , senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International E@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ics .
The US economy has been per@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ing relatively well , the recovery adding tr@@ illi@@ on@@ s of dollars to the balance sh@@ e@@ et and gen@@ er@@ ating little inflation .
However the Fed cannot ign@@ or@@ e the less ro@@ s@@ y global out@@ look .
It has warned m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets to be read@@ y for a hike but in@@ di@@ c@@ ations are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
The decision is due to be announced at 20.@@ 00 C@@ E@@ T on Thursday .
D@@ el@@ t@@ a State University sh@@ oo@@ ter left note of a@@ p@@ ology
After shooting and killing his g@@ ir@@ l@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his c@@ olle@@ ag@@ ue later that day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was " sor@@ ry " for the first murder and wished he " could take it back , " authorities revealed Tuesday .
Police in Gau@@ tier , M@@ i@@ s@@ s. said Lam@@ b , a g@@ e@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ y and social science education in@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tor at D@@ el@@ t@@ a State University , called 911 around 10 a.@@ m .
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
Lam@@ b told the disp@@ at@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
He said " I shot my wife last night " and also mentioned that there is a " sweet dog " in the h@@ ou@@ se that is " not going to bo@@ th@@ er anyone " but is likely u@@ p@@ set .
Police asked the c@@ all@@ er his name , but he didn 't give it .
Lam@@ b did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s , 4@@ 1 , and a h@@ an@@ d@@ w@@ r@@ it@@ ten note from Lam@@ b , 45 , that said : " I am so sor@@ ry I wish I could take it back .
I lo@@ v@@ ed Amy and she is the only person who ever lo@@ v@@ ed me .
After writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to D@@ el@@ t@@ a State where he killed E@@ than S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t , a history p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as c@@ ops closed in .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn 't know of any con@@ fli@@ c@@ t between Lam@@ b and S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t but " ob@@ vi@@ ously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b 's mind . "
Despite reports Monday that Lam@@ b al@@ le@@ g@@ e@@ d@@ ly believed P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s was also ro@@ man@@ tic@@ ally involved with S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t , authorities said Tuesday that there was " no information , no evidence " of a " love tri@@ angle . "
P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s was described as a " good person " by Shawn O '@@ S@@ te@@ en , who said he had been m@@ ar@@ ri@@ ed to her for about seven years .
The two di@@ v@@ or@@ c@@ ed 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O '@@ S@@ te@@ en said he and P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was " devastated . "
He said P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s and her daughter were " absolutely best friends . "
P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s worked an online job from her home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ l@@ es , identified as a close friend of P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s by the Sun Herald .
Kno@@ w@@ l@@ es said P@@ r@@ ent@@ i@@ s@@ s , who had a h@@ o@@ un@@ d dog named L@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ n@@ ing , had been dating Lam@@ b for about three years .
" She always wanted to help other people , " Kno@@ w@@ l@@ es said .
Police said Lam@@ b had ph@@ on@@ ed relatives at some point Monday to tell them " he 's not going to j@@ a@@ il . "
When c@@ ops caught up with him on H@@ ig@@ h@@ way 1 near G@@ re@@ en@@ v@@ ille later that night , Lam@@ b pulled his car over , b@@ a@@ il@@ ed out on foot , ran into the w@@ oo@@ ds and shot and killed himself .
Lam@@ b received a doc@@ torate in education from D@@ el@@ t@@ a State in the sp@@ r@@ ing of 20@@ 15 , according to his re@@ su@@ me posted on the un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity 's website .

E@@ u@@ ro@@ wings : L@@ u@@ f@@ th@@ an@@ s@@ a re@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ting group
L@@ u@@ f@@ th@@ an@@ s@@ a is planning a major re@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction of its group .
The L@@ u@@ f@@ th@@ an@@ s@@ a group will save half a billion E@@ u@@ ro@@ s per year through improvements to the or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation alone .
Re@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs .
Me@@ an@@ while new negotiations are being carried out with the p@@ il@@ o@@ ts ' union .
L@@ u@@ f@@ th@@ an@@ s@@ a is re@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ing the structure of its business and u@@ p@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ding its low-cost sub@@ si@@ di@@ ar@@ y E@@ u@@ ro@@ wings .
The goal of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a con@@ tri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on to profits of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue sy@@ ner@@ g@@ i@@ es , the a@@ ir@@ line announced on Wednesday .
Among other things , L@@ u@@ f@@ th@@ an@@ s@@ a in the future will have no executive board for the p@@ as@@ sen@@ ger business .
The E@@ u@@ ro@@ wings b@@ u@@ d@@ get a@@ ir@@ line will instead be developed to become as independent as possible .
In the future , K@@ ar@@ l Ul@@ rich Gar@@ n@@ ad@@ t will be responsible for E@@ u@@ ro@@ wings on the management board head@@ ed by Car@@ st@@ en S@@ po@@ h@@ r .
With this new real@@ ign@@ ment S@@ po@@ h@@ r un@@ der@@ lines the importance of E@@ u@@ ro@@ wings , with which the group wants to compete against R@@ y@@ an@@ air and E@@ as@@ y@@ jet in the future .
U@@ p to now the or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation of the 1@@ 20,000 employees has been extremely complex .
The a@@ ir@@ line is con@@ so@@ li@@ dating the p@@ as@@ sen@@ ger a@@ ir@@ line group , which provides three quarters of the annual tur@@ n@@ o@@ ver of € 30 billion , under one um@@ bre@@ l@@ la .

M@@ an@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ er United 's L@@ u@@ k@@ e Shaw out for months with double f@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ ure
L@@ u@@ k@@ e Shaw suffered a double f@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ ure of his right leg during M@@ an@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ er United 's Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League de@@ fe@@ at at P@@ S@@ V E@@ in@@ d@@ h@@ o@@ v@@ en .
While this left the full-@@ back in te@@ ars and will rule him out for at least six months , Lou@@ is van Ga@@ al remains h@@ op@@ eful Shaw could play again this season .
The injury was caused by a reck@@ less tackle from H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno in the 15@@ th minute after the 20@@ -year-old Shaw had bur@@ s@@ t into the P@@ S@@ V area .
He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and re@@ qu@@ i@@ red ox@@ y@@ gen before being taken to hospital .
Van Ga@@ al said : " He has a double leg f@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ ure and is in hospital . "
He will be trans@@ fer@@ red tomorrow or m@@ ay@@ be a day later and then operated on in M@@ an@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ er .
It is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to M@@ an@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ er United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fanta@@ st@@ ically and then this happens .
When it was in the d@@ re@@ s@@ sing room he had an ox@@ y@@ gen m@@ ask on .
He was cr@@ y@@ ing .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double f@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ ure it is six months and he will not play in the group ph@@ as@@ e .
I hope he can play again this season .
Moreno appeared f@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ ate to es@@ c@@ a@@ p@@ e a red card and the conc@@ es@@ si@@ on of a sp@@ o@@ t@@ -@@ kick .
N@@ i@@ c@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ ol@@ i , the re@@ fer@@ e@@ e , did not p@@ en@@ al@@ ise the M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an .
Van Ga@@ al suggested the Italian official had er@@ red .
You can judge for yo@@ ur@@ self when I say it is a p@@ en@@ al@@ ty and a red card .
It was a very bad tackle with two legs .
A t@@ w@@ e@@ et on Shaw 's account read : " Thank you everyone for your messages , words can 't describe how gut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back str@@ on@@ ger . "

The England def@@ en@@ der will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
P@@ h@@ illi@@ p C@@ o@@ c@@ u , the P@@ S@@ V coach , said : " It 's a very bad injury . "
If any player go@@ es off with this kind of injury , e@@ very@@ body is very sad about it .
It is never the in@@ ten@@ ti@@ on of our players to in@@ j@@ ure an op@@ p@@ on@@ ent .
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van Ga@@ al 's H@@ ol@@ l@@ and at the 20@@ 14 World Cup .
" He fin@@ ds it very difficult because the in@@ ten@@ ti@@ on was not to in@@ j@@ ure the op@@ p@@ on@@ ent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it 's not good , " C@@ o@@ c@@ u said .
For me it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he [ Moreno ] touched it , but I couldn 't see the tackle on L@@ u@@ k@@ e .
S@@ pe@@ aking to S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 , Moreno said : " I know how it fe@@ els , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sor@@ ry .

Un@@ less , it seems , you are David C@@ am@@ er@@ on .
Asked by a provider of h@@ o@@ li@@ day chil@@ d@@ care schemes to name his f@@ a@@ vo@@ ur@@ it@@ e k@@ ids ' book , the prime minister op@@ ted for The L@@ or@@ a@@ x , the 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1 environmental f@@ able by D@@ r S@@ e@@ us@@ s .
It was a difficult choice , C@@ am@@ er@@ on writes in a m@@ es@@ s@@ age published on the website of the Su@@ per@@ C@@ am@@ p@@ s company , continuing : " F@@ un@@ n@@ y , moving , creative and with a powerful m@@ es@@ s@@ age , it 's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a m@@ es@@ s@@ age that we have previously missed . "
All very well , e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ t that the sub@@ sequ@@ ent par@@ ag@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ h in which C@@ am@@ er@@ on su@@ p@@ po@@ se@@ d@@ ly des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es the p@@ lot of the book instead gives a p@@ r@@ é@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to p@@ ad out the fairly b@@ ri@@ e@@ f original te@@ x@@ t .
" S@@ et in the w@@ all@@ ed city of Th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ V@@ ille , where all nature has gone and even the air is a com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the h@@ e@@ art of his d@@ re@@ am g@@ ir@@ l , Au@@ d@@ re@@ y , by f@@ ul@@ f@@ illing her wish to see a real tre@@ e , " it read@@ s , ch@@ ron@@ i@@ c@@ ling a love interest un@@ k@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ n to D@@ r S@@ e@@ us@@ s , real name T@@ h@@ e@@ od@@ or S@@ e@@ us@@ s Ge@@ i@@ s@@ el , who died in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 1 .
If that wasn 't s@@ us@@ p@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s enough , C@@ am@@ er@@ on 's sub@@ mit@@ ted te@@ x@@ t read@@ s in part like a p@@ lot su@@ m@@ m@@ ar@@ y of the L@@ or@@ a@@ x film provided on the Internet Mo@@ v@@ ie Dat@@ ab@@ as@@ e website , which begins : " In the w@@ all@@ ed city of Th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ V@@ ille , where everything is ar@@ ti@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ al and even the air is a com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the h@@ e@@ art of his d@@ re@@ am g@@ ir@@ l , Au@@ d@@ re@@ y . "
G@@ i@@ v@@ en he is an avo@@ w@@ e@@ d@@ ly hands-on par@@ ent , it seems un@@ likely C@@ am@@ er@@ on is so un@@ fam@@ ili@@ ar with the book 's p@@ lot , in which a young un@@ named boy h@@ e@@ ars how the local environment was devastated by the av@@ ar@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s , tre@@ e-@@ ch@@ op@@ p@@ ing , th@@ ne@@ ed-@@ k@@ n@@ itting On@@ c@@ e-@@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ou@@ s L@@ or@@ a@@ x , a s@@ qu@@ at , m@@ ou@@ st@@ a@@ ch@@ i@@ o@@ ed c@@ re@@ ature who " sp@@ e@@ ak@@ s for the trees . "
Most likely , such a relatively lo@@ w@@ ly PR t@@ ask would have been out@@ so@@ ur@@ c@@ ed to an aide , se@@ em@@ ingly one who has never read The L@@ or@@ a@@ x 20 times in a row to a child .
A D@@ ow@@ n@@ ing Street spokeswoman said the te@@ x@@ t was believed to have come from C@@ am@@ er@@ on 's con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ en@@ cy office .
Su@@ per@@ C@@ am@@ p@@ s confirmed that the te@@ x@@ t was provided from C@@ am@@ er@@ on 's staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Ad@@ am L@@ y@@ th was clearly at risk of England o@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ si@@ on but it 's still t@@ ou@@ gh
T@@ aking on P@@ ak@@ i@@ st@@ an in the United Arab Emirates is a t@@ ou@@ gh as@@ si@@ gn@@ ment but after seeing the s@@ qu@@ ad England have s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted for the t@@ our , a re@@ pe@@ at of the 3-@@ 0 Test series de@@ fe@@ at suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't rule out an away win , either .
A@@ la@@ st@@ a@@ ir C@@ oo@@ k 's side may be less e@@ x@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ c@@ ed than the one three years ago but there are good players of sp@@ in in that b@@ at@@ ting l@@ in@@ e@@ up and the collective m@@ in@@ d@@ set is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ th@@ ful po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ity .
With the ball , Mo@@ e@@ en Ali is developing as a sp@@ in@@ ner and A@@ di@@ l R@@ ash@@ id , even if he is an un@@ k@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ n quant@@ ity at Test level , represents an attacking option .
Rel@@ ated : Ad@@ am L@@ y@@ th dropped from England Test s@@ qu@@ ad and re@@ plac@@ ed by Alex H@@ ales
The decision to o@@ m@@ it Ad@@ am L@@ y@@ th is ob@@ vi@@ ously a t@@ ou@@ gh one for me to an@@ al@@ y@@ se as his head coach at Yorkshire .
His seven Test@@ s have been against two good att@@ ac@@ ks in ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing conditions and the simple but har@@ s@@ h reality is that c@@ ri@@ ck@@ e@@ ters are j@@ ud@@ ged on output .
There were no question m@@ ar@@ k@@ s over Joe R@@ oo@@ t , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best s@@ el@@ ec@@ tors .
A couple of hal@@ f@@ -@@ c@@ ent@@ ur@@ ies and L@@ y@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own de@@ st@@ in@@ y .
H@@ op@@ e@@ f@@ ul@@ ly if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along .
The England head coach , T@@ re@@ v@@ or Bay@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ s , p@@ r@@ a@@ ised his attitude even when he was not per@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
The question of how long a Test b@@ at@@ s@@ man gets to make his mark is a t@@ ou@@ gh one .
L@@ y@@ th got seven c@@ a@@ p@@ s - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while N@@ ick Com@@ p@@ ton got nine .
Only Com@@ p@@ ton got the chance home and away .
The only g@@ ri@@ p@@ e you could have was that England went for Jonathan T@@ ro@@ t@@ t in the Caribbean first - when L@@ y@@ th was in top form - but that w@@ ast@@ ed opportunity is in the past now .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a b@@ at@@ s@@ man I rate highly .
He is an X@@ -@@ factor c@@ ri@@ ck@@ e@@ ter , which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 2@@ 36 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit .
He must at least be aff@@ orded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course de@@ p@@ end on the m@@ ak@@ e-@@ up of the side in the U@@ A@@ E .
The idea of Mo@@ e@@ en opening the b@@ at@@ ting al@@ on@@ g@@ side C@@ oo@@ k , which would get the e@@ x@@ tra sp@@ in@@ ner in while keeping four qu@@ icks , has been flo@@ ated and it is not something I am against .
I don 't see why a st@@ ro@@ k@@ em@@ ak@@ er cannot bat there and this le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ h@@ an@@ der has already sh@@ own he is one h@@ el@@ l of a c@@ ri@@ ck@@ e@@ ter .
Mo@@ e@@ en may not have done the job for his co@@ un@@ ty , Wor@@ c@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ sh@@ ir@@ e , but he has been a N@@ o@@ 3 for them and there is not much di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence .
My old te@@ am@@ -@@ mate J@@ u@@ st@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 Test@@ s at first drop before st@@ e@@ p@@ p@@ ing up to open in 2001 .
He pe@@ eled off three c@@ ent@@ ur@@ ies immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar An@@ s@@ ari comes into the s@@ qu@@ ad as b@@ ack@@ -@@ up sp@@ in@@ ner and , in my limited de@@ al@@ ings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
People may look at his r@@ a@@ w st@@ at@@ s - aver@@ ag@@ ing 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a pun@@ t but there are not a h@@ e@@ a@@ p of sp@@ inners putting their hands up and s@@ el@@ ec@@ tors have op@@ ted for youth .
He will le@@ ar@@ n a lot on this t@@ our .
Away from the s@@ qu@@ ad , England look to have made a couple of sh@@ re@@ w@@ d ad@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s to their coaching staff .
The a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment of Mah@@ el@@ a J@@ ay@@ a@@ war@@ den@@ e , the S@@ r@@ i Lan@@ ka b@@ at@@ s@@ man , as a consultant for the Test m@@ at@@ ches could be a m@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ stroke .
He is one of the game 's lo@@ v@@ el@@ i@@ est blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all att@@ ac@@ ks .
Paul Coll@@ in@@ g@@ wood comes in for the w@@ h@@ it@@ e-@@ ball leg of the t@@ our and will bring both energy and a ru@@ th@@ less streak into the se@@ t@@ up .
I always felt he was bor@@ n to be involved in international c@@ ri@@ cket , be it playing or coaching , and like Mah@@ el@@ a has n@@ ou@@ s that can be t@@ apped .
Sometimes new vo@@ i@@ c@@ es in the d@@ re@@ s@@ sing room , even if the messages are con@@ si@@ st@@ ent with what has been said before , can fresh@@ en up a side .
Col@@ ly 's Dur@@ ham te@@ am@@ -@@ mate Ben St@@ o@@ k@@ es is rested for the one-@@ d@@ ay@@ ers , R@@ oo@@ t was given a similar break against Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a and I for one have no issue with this .
While not everyone will agree , the co@@ a@@ ch@@ es and s@@ el@@ ec@@ tors do not set the schedule .
And you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
Such de@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on@@ s are never taken li@@ gh@@ t@@ ly .

David C@@ am@@ er@@ on 's hal@@ f@@ -@@ b@@ aked rene@@ go@@ ti@@ ation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets de@@ ep@@ er into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of gen@@ ial J@@ er@@ em@@ y " Is it Yes or No ? " Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n to the L@@ ab@@ our leadership , or the T@@ U@@ C c@@ ut@@ ting up rou@@ gh over Europe on Tuesday .
Fo@@ re@@ ign@@ ers have their Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n@@ s and N@@ i@@ g@@ e@@ l Far@@ ag@@ es too .
A European di@@ pl@@ o@@ m@@ at ch@@ um e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed the other day that , sun@@ k in as@@ s@@ or@@ ted c@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ es as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are f@@ ed up with Britain 's self-@@ ab@@ sor@@ bed ag@@ en@@ d@@ a of di@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ ive conc@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ s and disrup@@ ti@@ v@@ e tre@@ at@@ y changes which they mostly don 't want .
In Bri@@ gh@@ ton for its annual be@@ an , the T@@ U@@ C decided it didn 't want them either if they ero@@ ded social protection .
We could even call it Dave and George 's s@@ el@@ f@@ ie ag@@ en@@ d@@ a .
PM and ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or ro@@ ck up to su@@ m@@ m@@ its or b@@ il@@ at@@ er@@ al sessions in foreign c@@ a@@ p@@ it@@ als , take a p@@ h@@ o@@ to of themselves in front of a fam@@ ou@@ s local m@@ on@@ um@@ ent , with or without local g@@ r@@ an@@ de@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
It 's all about me .
My European p@@ al , who wants an out@@ war@@ d@@ -@@ looking Britain inside the EU t@@ ent - " D@@ on 't leave us alone with France , " says B@@ er@@ lin - suggests that more short@@ -@@ si@@ gh@@ ted ministers and officials in some c@@ a@@ p@@ it@@ als have got to the point where they don 't care whether we stay or leave .
An@@ g@@ el@@ a M@@ er@@ k@@ el , Germany 's c@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ously le@@ v@@ el@@ -@@ head@@ ed ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it go@@ es bad for her , as it did for over@@ st@@ ay@@ ers Thatcher ( 11 years ) , M@@ it@@ ter@@ r@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France 's F@@ r@@ an@@ ç@@ o@@ is H@@ ol@@ l@@ an@@ de is facing re-@@ election or replacement in 20@@ 17 .
He is a f@@ ad@@ ing force too .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ al@@ istic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
It 's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the S@@ el@@ f@@ ie B@@ r@@ its , whose energy might be better spent pre@@ vent@@ ing Scotland leaving the U@@ K - something they don 't want either because most have similar se@@ par@@ at@@ ist ten@@ den@@ c@@ i@@ es .
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliber@@ ately un@@ h@@ el@@ p@@ ful remarks , S@@ N@@ P@@ -@@ style , during the U@@ K 's 20@@ 17 referendum campaign to ha@@ st@@ en the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my p@@ al suggests .
" The rene@@ go@@ ti@@ ation was a fi@@ x " and " Britain got nothing of value out of the rene@@ go@@ ti@@ ation . "
The E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans know to their cost how pre@@ dat@@ or@@ y F@@ le@@ et Street can be and how E@@ U@@ -@@ sc@@ ep@@ tic the o@@ li@@ g@@ ar@@ ch press bar@@ on@@ s are , as they were not during the Tony B@@ en@@ n@@ -@@ inspired 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 5 referendum which en@@ d@@ or@@ s@@ ed our 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 3 ent@@ ry by a r@@ at@@ i@@ o of 2 : 1 .
They may di@@ m@@ ly remember B@@ or@@ is Johnson , the ar@@ ch E@@ u@@ ro@@ -@@ op@@ port@@ un@@ ist , making his name as an " EU straight b@@ an@@ an@@ as " Brussels cor@@ re@@ sp@@ on@@ dent in the early 9@@ 0@@ s .
For all his fo@@ ol@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ n@@ ess E@@ d M@@ ili@@ b@@ and knew who his en@@ em@@ ies were .
They included the m@@ e@@ d@@ ley of ta@@ x@@ -@@ sh@@ y r@@ as@@ c@@ als , ph@@ one-@@ hacking fore@@ ign@@ ers and p@@ se@@ ud@@ o n@@ on-@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s who own most of our great new@@ sp@@ a@@ p@@ ers .
Actually Tony B@@ la@@ ir th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t much the same about them , but re@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed that when you 're in a cage with a r@@ an@@ d@@ y g@@ or@@ ill@@ a you have to pass the b@@ an@@ an@@ as to di@@ str@@ act it from having you for lunch and again for te@@ a .
In fact M@@ ili@@ b@@ and was more B@@ la@@ ir@@ it@@ e than B@@ la@@ ir in op@@ po@@ s@@ ing C@@ am@@ er@@ on 's referendum whe@@ e@@ ze , since B@@ la@@ ir had conceded the p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le over the EU 's abor@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and D@@ ut@@ ch voters in 2005 who gave him a g@@ e@@ t@@ -@@ out card .
The press never f@@ or@@ gave him that either .
But nice J@@ er@@ em@@ y Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n , who gave me a fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly p@@ at on the back at W@@ e@@ st@@ m@@ in@@ ster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-@@ ad@@ op@@ ting N@@ e@@ i@@ l K@@ in@@ n@@ o@@ ck 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ t@@ t Murdoch strategy of the 8@@ 0@@ s , a m@@ i@@ st@@ ak@@ e then and now .
It may take time , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to eng@@ age with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andre@@ w Mar@@ r whose BBC so@@ f@@ a he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's official position on Europe is what I will kin@@ d@@ ly call e@@ v@@ ol@@ ving .
He says he 'd like us to stay in a re@@ formed EU .
Well , most people outside U@@ k@@ i@@ p 's w@@ o@@ ad@@ -@@ wearing ten@@ den@@ cy and the w@@ il@@ der sh@@ o@@ res of Tory little En@@ g@@ l@@ an@@ der@@ ism can probably say y@@ es to that .
It 's what H@@ il@@ ar@@ y " A B@@ en@@ n , but not a B@@ en@@ n@@ it@@ e " B@@ en@@ n said on r@@ a@@ di@@ o and TV this week as the boy sc@@ out in him struggled not to ad@@ m@@ it that Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment of ab@@ r@@ a@@ si@@ v@@ e John Mc@@ D@@ on@@ n@@ el@@ l as s@@ ha@@ do@@ w ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 7@@ 0@@ s , when his old d@@ ad struggled on TV to be di@@ s@@ loyal to L@@ ab@@ our cabinet colleagues without going too far and lo@@ s@@ ing his cabinet job .
H@@ il@@ ar@@ y 's st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ le was more attractive .
But fighting to stay in " in all circumstances " - B@@ en@@ n 's p@@ h@@ r@@ as@@ e - was not what Mc@@ D@@ on@@ n@@ el@@ l was saying , nor what J@@ C told pe@@ ers and MP@@ s at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
Whatever the bott@@ o@@ m@@ -@@ up , touch@@ y-@@ fe@@ ely image Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n wants to con@@ v@@ ey - remember , he even touched me - m@@ es@@ s@@ age di@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the m@@ a@@ el@@ st@@ ro@@ m that is social media , a h@@ o@@ t@@ bed of par@@ an@@ o@@ ia and be@@ tra@@ y@@ al .
It 's fair enough not to give C@@ am@@ er@@ on a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take L@@ ab@@ our 's support for granted in the referendum campaign , as Mc@@ D@@ on@@ n@@ el@@ l has said .
S@@ im@@ on Jenkins certainly th@@ in@@ ks so .
But Mc@@ D@@ on@@ n@@ el@@ l and Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n 's b@@ a@@ si@@ c e@@ qu@@ i@@ voc@@ ation about EU membership - con@@ si@@ st@@ ent with their B@@ en@@ n@@ it@@ e si@@ e@@ ge economy , anti-@@ c@@ a@@ p@@ it@@ al@@ ist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic discussion among le@@ f@@ tw@@ ing di@@ s@@ si@@ d@@ ent@@ s for whom the n@@ ar@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ ism of small di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence is a central ten@@ et of doc@@ tr@@ in@@ al s@@ qu@@ ab@@ b@@ l@@ es .
As with his e@@ qu@@ i@@ voc@@ ation over N@@ at@@ o - Tom W@@ at@@ son is ad@@ am@@ ant that J@@ C won 't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be ob@@ li@@ ged to try to make sense of it all for their m@@ a@@ st@@ ers at home .
W@@ h@@ y should Paris or B@@ er@@ lin waste political capital - they have s@@ us@@ p@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s voters too - on conc@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ s to Britain when it may all be po@@ in@@ t@@ less ?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the B@@ r@@ its " fe@@ e@@ b@@ le military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a co@@ st@@ -@@ c@@ ut@@ ting Tory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British In@@ f@@ lu@@ ence Security For@@ um on Monday .
Experts c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ise Public Health England e-@@ c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es re@@ view
C@@ la@@ im@@ s by a go@@ v@@ er@@ n@@ m@@ ent@@ -@@ f@@ un@@ ded agency that e-@@ c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es are 95 % less harmful than smoking ar@@ o@@ se from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o industry , researchers have said .
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( B@@ M@@ J ) joined the L@@ anc@@ et in c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ ing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ H@@ E ) in its report on e-@@ c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es .
P@@ H@@ E published the " l@@ an@@ d@@ mark " report last month , des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ing it as a " comprehensive re@@ view of the evidence . "
But several researchers have questioned the ro@@ b@@ u@@ st@@ n@@ ess of the data and po@@ in@@ ted to links between some experts and the to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o industry .
An editorial in the L@@ anc@@ et medical jo@@ ur@@ n@@ al last month attacked the " e@@ x@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ il@@ y f@@ li@@ m@@ s@@ y foundation " on which P@@ H@@ E based its main conclusion .
W@@ r@@ it@@ ing in the B@@ M@@ J , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were " built on ro@@ ck or sand . "
Martin McK@@ e@@ e , p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of European public health at the London School of H@@ y@@ g@@ i@@ ene and Tropical Me@@ di@@ c@@ ine , and S@@ im@@ on Cap@@ e@@ well , p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or of clinical ep@@ i@@ de@@ m@@ i@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : " A fundamental p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le of public health is that po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es should be based on evidence of eff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess . "
They said the public would expect P@@ H@@ E 's claims that " the current best estimate is that e-@@ c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es are around 95 % less harmful than smoking " would be based on a detailed re@@ view of evidence and mo@@ d@@ ell@@ ing .
In fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people con@@ ven@@ ed to develop a mul@@ ti@@ -@@ c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ia decision an@@ al@@ y@@ sis ( M@@ C@@ D@@ A ) model to syn@@ thes@@ ise their opinions on the har@@ ms associated with different n@@ i@@ c@@ o@@ t@@ in@@ e-@@ con@@ ta@@ in@@ ing products ; the results of the meeting were su@@ m@@ m@@ ar@@ ised in a research p@@ a@@ p@@ er .
McK@@ e@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said one sp@@ on@@ s@@ or of the meeting was a company called E@@ u@@ ro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received f@@ un@@ ding from British American T@@ ob@@ ac@@ c@@ o for an independent study .
He also en@@ d@@ or@@ s@@ ed B@@ A@@ T 's public health c@@ re@@ den@@ ti@@ als in a sustain@@ ability report , they said .
One of the 12 people at the meeting de@@ c@@ la@@ red f@@ un@@ ding from an e-@@ cigarette man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er but not the f@@ un@@ ding he was reported to have received previously from the to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o company Philip Mor@@ r@@ is International , they added .
The r@@ ation@@ al@@ e for s@@ el@@ ec@@ ting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e-@@ cigarette ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s , some of whom also de@@ c@@ l@@ are industry f@@ un@@ ding in the p@@ a@@ p@@ er .
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their e@@ x@@ per@@ t@@ ise in to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o control .
The meeting was also attended by the to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o lead at P@@ H@@ E .
The research p@@ a@@ p@@ er produced by the group " t@@ ell@@ ingly conce@@ des " there is a lack of " hard evidence for the har@@ ms of most products on most of the c@@ r@@ it@@ er@@ ia , " McK@@ e@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
However , n@@ one of these links or li@@ mit@@ ations are di@@ sc@@ us@@ s@@ ed in the P@@ H@@ E report .
McK@@ e@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said P@@ H@@ E 's claims that " there is no evidence so far that e-@@ c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es are ac@@ ting as a rou@@ te into smoking for children or n@@ on-@@ s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers " were premature .
Pro@@ f K@@ e@@ v@@ in F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and w@@ ell@@ being at P@@ H@@ E , said the claims in the B@@ M@@ J had been responded to before .
He said : " E@@ -@@ c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es are si@@ gn@@ ific@@ an@@ t@@ ly less harmful than smoking . "
One in two li@@ fel@@ ong s@@ mo@@ k@@ ers dies from their ad@@ di@@ c@@ ti@@ on .
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-@@ c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es are small by com@@ par@@ i@@ s@@ on , but we must continue to study the long-term effects .
P@@ H@@ E has a clear d@@ ut@@ y to in@@ form the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public con@@ f@@ u@@ si@@ on about the rel@@ ative d@@ ang@@ ers compared to to@@ b@@ ac@@ c@@ o .
Nearly 8@@ 0,000 people a year die of a s@@ mo@@ k@@ in@@ g@@ -@@ related illness and smoking costs the NHS £ 2@@ b@@ n a year .
By sp@@ ell@@ ing out clearly the current evidence - that while e-@@ c@@ ig@@ are@@ tt@@ es are not risk-@@ free , they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are f@@ ul@@ f@@ illing our national re@@ m@@ it .
BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ En@@ der@@ s , says former Ch@@ an@@ nel 4 chief
The former Ch@@ an@@ nel 4 chairman L@@ u@@ k@@ e Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ der@@ s and The V@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ e , saying its commercial ri@@ v@@ als would " give their right arm " for hit shows such as the Albert Square so@@ a@@ p .
Johnson said the lic@@ ence fe@@ e should only be used to make the sort of p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es that are not made by other U@@ K bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ers .
He c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ised the BBC for putting public service p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es likely to be w@@ at@@ ched by a s@@ m@@ aller audience in t@@ ou@@ gh s@@ lo@@ ts against its ri@@ v@@ als " biggest rating shows , and on ch@@ ann@@ els such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
After the BBC 's director general , Tony Hall , said the cor@@ p@@ or@@ ation wanted to do more in par@@ t@@ ner@@ ship with other or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Ch@@ an@@ nel 4 to do a ti@@ e-@@ up with the BBC without success .
" I do st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ le with the idea that the BBC com@@ missions and bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ s p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es that would clearly be sh@@ own by un@@ sub@@ si@@ di@@ s@@ ed ri@@ v@@ als , " Johnson told the House of L@@ or@@ ds communication com@@ mit@@ tee , as part of its in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into the future of the BBC .
If you keep the lic@@ ence fe@@ e , which I 'm not sure in the medi@@ um or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es that others aren 't making and com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ing .
They bro@@ ad@@ cast The V@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ e in a prime slot because they want to gain as bro@@ ad a support as possible for its future .
The idea that no one else would show that is a jo@@ k@@ e , it 's lu@@ di@@ c@@ ro@@ us , it 's ob@@ vi@@ ously n@@ on@@ sense .
Johnson said : " I don 't see why a re@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ e tax should f@@ un@@ d p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es that could be f@@ un@@ ded without subsidy .
The V@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ e is one , E@@ ast@@ En@@ der@@ s is another , ad@@ mit@@ te@@ d@@ ly made in-@@ h@@ ou@@ se .
F@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ly other ch@@ ann@@ els would give their right arm for it .
I st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ le to see how it 's public service broadcasting .
I don 't think that would di@@ m@@ in@@ ish the BBC at all .
Johnson , a s@@ er@@ ial ent@@ re@@ p@@ r@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r who led Ch@@ an@@ nel 4 from 2004 to 20@@ 10 , said the BBC was guilty of ch@@ as@@ ing ratings " because of the am@@ b@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support .

His comments about the BBC 's most popular shows e@@ ch@@ o those of former Sk@@ y executive Tony B@@ all , who used his Mac@@ T@@ ag@@ g@@ art le@@ c@@ t@@ ure in Edinburgh in 2003 to p@@ ro@@ po@@ se that the BBC sell off shows such as E@@ ast@@ En@@ der@@ s .
Johnson said the BBC 's more n@@ ich@@ e public service p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es " go on to BB@@ C@@ 4 where quite often you can 't measure the audience but they f@@ ul@@ fi@@ l their re@@ m@@ it and they can argue when they go on their s@@ anc@@ ti@@ m@@ on@@ ious missions about j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ y@@ ing £ 4@@ b@@ n in lic@@ ence fe@@ e income , " Well of course , we do all these obscure p@@ ro@@ g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ es that no one w@@ at@@ ched . "
They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them .
On the lic@@ ence fe@@ e , Johnson told the com@@ mit@@ tee : " I challenge you to find a more re@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ e system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
Of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I w@@ on@@ der if they do because they don 't con@@ su@@ me a lot of the BBC .
Former Sk@@ y and Ch@@ an@@ nel 5 executive David El@@ stein , who also gave evidence to the com@@ mit@@ tee on Tuesday , said the BBC should re@@ v@@ ise its R@@ e@@ i@@ th@@ ian mission to " in@@ form , e@@ du@@ c@@ ate and ent@@ er@@ ta@@ in . "
He said little of the BBC 's output was now formally c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fied as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.@@ 1 % on r@@ a@@ di@@ o - and it should take a lead from public service bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ers in Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a and Canada and change it to " in@@ form , en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten and ent@@ er@@ ta@@ in .

On the issue of par@@ t@@ ner@@ ships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said only a h@@ an@@ d@@ ful were sh@@ own on TV , and enter into al@@ li@@ ances with commercial bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast@@ ers to make them all available to watch online .
'@@ Son@@ o@@ gen@@ e@@ tic@@ s ' allows brain c@@ ells to be con@@ tro@@ l@@ led by sound w@@ av@@ es
The video shows how the ne@@ m@@ at@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with s@@ on@@ ic p@@ ul@@ s@@ es .
Sci@@ en@@ ti@@ st@@ s have b@@ red wor@@ ms with gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally modified nervous systems that can be con@@ tro@@ l@@ led by bur@@ st@@ s of sound w@@ av@@ es .
The tiny ne@@ m@@ at@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are bla@@ sted with s@@ on@@ ic p@@ ul@@ s@@ es that are too high@@ -@@ p@@ it@@ ched for humans to hear .
The p@@ ul@@ s@@ es work by s@@ w@@ it@@ ching on mo@@ tor ne@@ ur@@ on c@@ ells that are gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally modified to carry m@@ em@@ b@@ r@@ an@@ e ch@@ ann@@ els that respond to ul@@ tr@@ as@@ on@@ ic w@@ av@@ es .
Rel@@ ated : R@@ es@@ e@@ ar@@ chers read and write brain activity with light
R@@ es@@ e@@ ar@@ chers said the wor@@ ms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , dubbed s@@ on@@ o@@ gen@@ e@@ tic@@ s , in which ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d can be used to ac@@ tiv@@ ate a range of brain , h@@ e@@ art and m@@ us@@ c@@ le c@@ ells from outside the body .
S@@ re@@ e@@ k@@ an@@ th Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani , a re@@ sear@@ cher at the S@@ al@@ k Institute in L@@ a J@@ ol@@ l@@ a , California , told the Guar@@ di@@ an that the procedure could one day replace de@@ ep@@ -@@ brain st@@ im@@ ul@@ ation , an in@@ v@@ a@@ si@@ v@@ e procedure that deli@@ v@@ er@@ s el@@ ec@@ tri@@ cal p@@ ul@@ s@@ es into people 's bra@@ ins to tre@@ at sy@@ mp@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ s of P@@ ar@@ k@@ inson 's disease .
N@@ em@@ at@@ o@@ de wor@@ ms do not usually re@@ act to ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d , but Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unded by a f@@ lu@@ id con@@ ta@@ in@@ ing m@@ i@@ c@@ ro@@ scopic bubbles .
The bubbles , he found , am@@ p@@ li@@ fy the ul@@ tr@@ as@@ on@@ ic w@@ av@@ es which then pass inside the wor@@ ms .
The am@@ p@@ li@@ fied ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d w@@ av@@ es act on st@@ ru@@ c@@ tu@@ res called TR@@ P@@ -@@ 4 ion ch@@ ann@@ els , found in the m@@ em@@ b@@ r@@ an@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms " c@@ ells .
The sound w@@ av@@ es make these ion ch@@ ann@@ els open up and ac@@ tiv@@ ate the c@@ ells they are att@@ a@@ ch@@ ed to , according to a report in N@@ at@@ ure Commun@@ i@@ c@@ ations .
To make ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ -@@ con@@ tro@@ l@@ led ne@@ m@@ at@@ o@@ des , Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mo@@ tor ne@@ ur@@ on@@ s carried TR@@ P@@ -@@ 4 ion ch@@ ann@@ els .
When he app@@ li@@ ed ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d to the modified creatures , the sound w@@ av@@ es were am@@ p@@ li@@ fied by the m@@ i@@ c@@ ro@@ bubbles and trans@@ mit@@ ted into the wor@@ ms , where they s@@ w@@ it@@ ched on the modified mo@@ tor ne@@ ur@@ on@@ s .
The procedure has some si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ it@@ i@@ es with op@@ to@@ gen@@ e@@ tic@@ s , a gro@@ und@@ breaking t@@ oo@@ l that allows s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ st@@ s to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch ne@@ ur@@ on@@ s on and off with p@@ ul@@ s@@ es of light .
But Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani said that s@@ on@@ o@@ gen@@ e@@ tic@@ s could have some ad@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ ag@@ es over that te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ que .
Un@@ like light , which has to be sent down an op@@ tic fi@@ b@@ r@@ e to the desired lo@@ c@@ ation inside the brain , low fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cy ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d w@@ av@@ es can pass through t@@ issue un@@ h@@ in@@ der@@ ed , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the sk@@ ull .
" We believe that , us@@ ing gene therapy and a th@@ er@@ a@@ p@@ e@@ u@@ tic v@@ ir@@ us , it may be possible to make target human ne@@ ur@@ on@@ s te@@ m@@ p@@ or@@ ar@@ il@@ y s@@ us@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ ble to the ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d si@@ gn@@ al in a clinical se@@ t@@ ting for certain ne@@ u@@ ro@@ lo@@ g@@ ical tre@@ at@@ ments , " said Ch@@ al@@ as@@ ani .

According to G@@ av@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of C@@ ru@@ el Des@@ ig@@ n@@ s and a le@@ c@@ tur@@ er at the University of Essex , ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside g@@ all@@ er@@ ies .
A lot of ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s are moving to work with activists within protest movements , re@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ing they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society .

They to@@ y@@ ed with creating a more real@@ istic do@@ d@@ g@@ y cor@@ p@@ or@@ ate ad@@ v@@ er@@ t , but " by r@@ am@@ m@@ ing it home with bright col@@ ours and anim@@ ation , it was more ar@@ re@@ st@@ ing . "
" They 've done a fantastic job in h@@ el@@ p@@ ing us raise concerns about the selling of illegal t@@ or@@ t@@ ure equipment at the fair , " says Tom Da@@ vi@@ es at Am@@ ne@@ st@@ y .
What we need now is for the U@@ K government to take action and ensure that t@@ or@@ t@@ ure equipment is not illegally traded on our do@@ or@@ step .
Per@@ ha@@ ps the most creative art s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unding the arms fair comes from inside Ex@@ C@@ e@@ L , where e@@ x@@ h@@ ib@@ it@@ ors flo@@ g fanta@@ st@@ ically e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

E@@ ig@@ h@@ t g@@ ol@@ d@@ en r@@ ul@@ es for living in student halls
It 's been 11 years since I mo@@ v@@ ed into student halls as an ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ou@@ s 19-year-old , still believing in b@@ er@@ ets and m@@ or@@ al rel@@ at@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ m , but it 's only now I rec@@ all the stra@@ in@@ ed s@@ miles of those I an@@ n@@ o@@ y@@ ed - and the n@@ um@@ er@@ ou@@ s , l@@ eng@@ th@@ y com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ts about others .
Most of what I learned can be di@@ st@@ ill@@ ed into eight simple r@@ ul@@ es .
Mo@@ ving into halls can range from m@@ il@@ d@@ ly ner@@ v@@ e-@@ r@@ ac@@ king to totally ter@@ ri@@ fying .
It 's te@@ mp@@ ting to b@@ ab@@ ble : telling people where you 're from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you st@@ and on Cor@@ b@@ y@@ n and why you " hon@@ e@@ st@@ ly neither love nor hate Mar@@ mit@@ e because seriously g@@ u@@ ys it 's just ye@@ ast e@@ x@@ tract H@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ H@@ A I 'll be in my room . "
Take a breath .
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
It st@@ e@@ ers the con@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ation and helps you to sc@@ out out the people you like v@@ er@@ su@@ s those you w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't talk to even if your e@@ y@@ el@@ ash@@ es were on fire and they were disp@@ ensing e@@ x@@ t@@ in@@ g@@ u@@ ishers .

People 's rooms often m@@ or@@ p@@ h into d@@ r@@ in@@ ks recep@@ tions , mo@@ vie@@ -@@ night ven@@ ues and com@@ m@@ un@@ al h@@ ang@@ out sp@@ o@@ ts , but they 're also where people get d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ ed and ad@@ just their un@@ der@@ wear .
Rel@@ ated : D@@ on 't even think about starting un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity in a rel@@ ation@@ ship
In@@ tro@@ v@@ er@@ ts get a r@@ a@@ w deal at un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity .
Y@@ our room should be a re@@ tre@@ at , yet many halls form an inter@@ -@@ ro@@ o@@ m@@ -@@ st@@ ro@@ l@@ ling culture that 's fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly , social and con@@ du@@ c@@ i@@ v@@ e to li@@ fel@@ ong fri@@ en@@ d@@ ships .
That can be h@@ el@@ l for someone who 's trying to re@@ charge .
N@@ o@@ thing in the culture allows you to say , " I like you and I want our fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I 've e@@ x@@ p@@ ended on inter@@ ac@@ ting with you . "

Since you 're starting un@@ i at the h@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t of B@@ ak@@ e-@@ O@@ f@@ f man@@ ia , k@@ n@@ o@@ ck@@ ing on people 's do@@ ors to in@@ tro@@ du@@ ce yo@@ ur@@ self with a pl@@ ate of bro@@ w@@ n@@ ies seems m@@ ar@@ g@@ in@@ ally less w@@ e@@ i@@ r@@ d , less 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 0@@ s " W@@ el@@ come to the n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ hood , I b@@ aked you something , now smile as I ask you per@@ s@@ on@@ al questions . "
O@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing h@@ o@@ m@@ em@@ a@@ de tre@@ ats is a great way to make friends .
Y@@ our hou@@ se@@ m@@ at@@ es will feel ob@@ li@@ ged to ch@@ at , and may end up as@@ so@@ c@@ i@@ ating your face with a ta@@ st@@ y surprise .
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously this is subject to you being a de@@ cent b@@ ak@@ er .
Po@@ or@@ ly-@@ f@@ used l@@ um@@ ps of f@@ l@@ our , su@@ gar and f@@ at are more likely to make people pre@@ tend to be as@@ le@@ ep when you k@@ n@@ o@@ ck .

If someone st@@ e@@ als your st@@ u@@ f@@ f , it 's an@@ n@@ o@@ y@@ ing and you have my sy@@ mp@@ a@@ th@@ ies - but try to deal with it more m@@ at@@ u@@ re@@ ly than my h@@ all@@ mate , who ta@@ in@@ ted her m@@ il@@ k with w@@ ash@@ in@@ g@@ -@@ up li@@ qu@@ id to punish those who st@@ ol@@ e it .
She 's in j@@ a@@ il now .
You sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't make n@@ o@@ ise that ke@@ ep@@ s people from sleeping or st@@ ud@@ y@@ ing .
This isn 't just to be a de@@ cent human , but because you are the p@@ ro@@ v@@ er@@ b@@ ial people in gl@@ ass h@@ ou@@ s@@ es .
A g@@ ir@@ l on my cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or asked her n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ our if they w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't mind turning down the drum and b@@ ass because it was 3@@ am and she had an e@@ x@@ am in the morning .
They responded by turning it up .
When they finally shut up at 5@@ am , she kin@@ d@@ ly let them sle@@ ep for two hours before bla@@ st@@ ing her own music , lo@@ ck@@ ing her do@@ or as she left for her th@@ re@@ e-@@ hour e@@ x@@ am .
W@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't it be ro@@ man@@ tic if your future sp@@ ou@@ se ha@@ p@@ p@@ en@@ ed to move into the same h@@ all as you ?
Con@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ el@@ y , w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't it be k@@ n@@ u@@ ck@@ le@@ -@@ bit@@ ingly awkward if you m@@ i@@ st@@ oo@@ k a h@@ all@@ mate for your future sp@@ ou@@ se , h@@ oo@@ ked up , broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mut@@ ual friends ?
Of course , the h@@ e@@ art wants what it wants - but if a hot h@@ all@@ mate is de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely not your future sp@@ ou@@ se , try to at least talk some sense into your gro@@ in .
In the e@@ x@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating moment you real@@ ise someone 's left their keys inside their un@@ locked room , the line between p@@ r@@ an@@ king and bul@@ l@@ y@@ ing is fin@@ er than it seems .

Terr@@ ac@@ ed h@@ ou@@ s@@ es for re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es , single parents , low e@@ ar@@ ners
Pro@@ per@@ ty ent@@ re@@ p@@ r@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r Mark@@ us Gil@@ d@@ ner is building ter@@ r@@ ac@@ ed h@@ ou@@ s@@ es in the M@@ id@@ d@@ le F@@ r@@ an@@ con@@ ian town of E@@ ck@@ ent@@ al for people who do not have much money .
For example for re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es - but also as a sign : " Not only re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es need ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation , but also single mothers and people on low in@@ comes . "
" I am de@@ m@@ on@@ str@@ ating how it is still possible to build e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ically and well n@@ o@@ w@@ ad@@ ay@@ s , " says the 44@@ -year-old in an interview .
Th@@ ou@@ s@@ an@@ d@@ s of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es are p@@ ush@@ ing their way onto the housing market .
En@@ tre@@ p@@ r@@ en@@ e@@ u@@ r Marcus Gil@@ d@@ ner believes he knows how quickly e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ical housing can be developed : with this project he is building ter@@ r@@ ac@@ ed h@@ ou@@ s@@ es for re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
Mr Gil@@ d@@ ner , thousands of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es are coming onto the housing market .
What solution are you off@@ er@@ ing ?
Mark@@ us Gil@@ d@@ ner : Mass ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation in con@@ ta@@ in@@ ers and g@@ y@@ ms is not sustain@@ able .
Because most of the people will be st@@ ay@@ ing here .
We will also need su@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ent housing sp@@ ace to accommodate the in@@ f@@ lu@@ x of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es over the next decades .
A totally standard th@@ re@@ e-@@ st@@ o@@ re@@ y ter@@ r@@ ac@@ ed h@@ ou@@ se is the solution .
Gil@@ d@@ ner : A ter@@ r@@ ac@@ ed h@@ ou@@ se ne@@ e@@ ds little sp@@ ace .
It f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ at@@ es in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ation .
It is different when the people are housed in blocks of flat@@ s .
Each of the six h@@ ou@@ s@@ es which are currently being built in the pilot project con@@ si@@ st@@ s of three living units each for four as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers .
Each living unit has two be@@ dro@@ o@@ m@@ s , one b@@ a@@ th@@ room , one k@@ it@@ chen and a lo@@ un@@ ge .
It 's possible that many re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es will say ; now that peace has re@@ turned I 'm going back .
Th@@ en the h@@ ou@@ s@@ es can easily be con@@ v@@ er@@ ted for different us@@ es .
What are the costs ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : The price for 160 m ² of living sp@@ ace per h@@ ou@@ se amounts to € 18@@ 4,000 without land .
That is man@@ age@@ able .
Con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction took six months .
That is reasonable .
Did building re@@ g@@ ul@@ ations com@@ p@@ lic@@ ate your plans ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : I carried out my project in ac@@ c@@ or@@ d@@ ance with building re@@ g@@ ul@@ ations .
The s@@ word of D@@ am@@ o@@ c@@ l@@ es threatening special building projects , and parking sp@@ ace re@@ g@@ ul@@ ations , always make it complicated .
S@@ c@@ ar@@ y .
It is still as@@ su@@ m@@ ed that anyone creating three flat@@ s in a ter@@ r@@ ac@@ ed h@@ ou@@ se ne@@ e@@ ds at least three parking plac@@ es .
Except that there is not enough sp@@ ace in towns .
And re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es and as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers have no cars .
How have residents re@@ acted to your ter@@ r@@ ac@@ ed h@@ ou@@ se project ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : There were some who accused me of building lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation for as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers .
That is de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely not tru@@ e .
But aren 't you making the competition for affordable housing wor@@ se ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : The tr@@ ut@@ h is over the last five years we have had a building b@@ oo@@ m in Germany , but it is lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation that has been built , which har@@ d@@ ly an@@ y@@ body can afford any longer .
My project gives the m@@ es@@ s@@ age that n@@ or@@ m@@ al people need housing sp@@ ace too .
Not only re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es need ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation , but also single mothers and people on low in@@ comes .
I am de@@ m@@ on@@ str@@ ating how it is still possible to build e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ically and well n@@ o@@ w@@ ad@@ ay@@ s .
This is what it is about .

i@@ OS 9 : how to get new iPhone operating system , as Apple u@@ p@@ date is released
The new operating system can be re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed by heading to the S@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ings app , t@@ apping " General , " and then s@@ el@@ ec@@ ting " S@@ o@@ f@@ tw@@ are U@@ p@@ date . "
If it 's read@@ y , the phone will give you the option to down@@ lo@@ ad and then in@@ st@@ all it .
Some have run into problems after that installation , being hit by an er@@ ro@@ r m@@ es@@ s@@ age telling them that " S@@ o@@ f@@ tw@@ are u@@ p@@ date failed . "
To get around that , us@@ ers are recommended either to wait for the r@@ ush to die down , or to try and u@@ p@@ grade through i@@ T@@ un@@ es .
The phone itself will g@@ u@@ i@@ de you through the rest of the process .
That might include d@@ el@@ e@@ t@@ ing a@@ p@@ ps to make sp@@ ace - but Apple has made that less likely by s@@ li@@ m@@ m@@ ing down the u@@ p@@ date , and also e@@ a@@ si@@ er to do us@@ ing a special t@@ oo@@ l that will suggest a@@ p@@ ps to d@@ el@@ e@@ te and then re-@@ in@@ st@@ all them once the process is over .
It 's worth en@@ s@@ ur@@ ing that your phone is charged or near a char@@ ger while the u@@ p@@ date happens , so that it doesn 't run out of b@@ at@@ ter@@ y .
If the charge is too low , Apple won 't let the u@@ p@@ date go ahead , since the phone d@@ y@@ ing halfway through could lead to the u@@ p@@ date breaking .

G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ el@@ man@@ n is a h@@ ol@@ der of the Federal C@@ ro@@ s@@ s of Mer@@ it 1@@ s@@ t class and is a fre@@ em@@ an of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ am@@ p and L@@ ü@@ b@@ be@@ ck@@ e .
G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ el@@ man@@ n su@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ ted the ch@@ ess club in Bad K@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ in@@ gen with a don@@ ation which was accepted by chairman Al@@ f@@ red K@@ le@@ in .
This makes it possible to take on members who cannot afford the membership fe@@ e
Y@@ ou@@ th work and talent sear@@ ches can also be pursued .
G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ el@@ man@@ n wants his membership of the ch@@ ess club as well as his fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly con@@ t@@ act with the " Re@@ d@@ -@@ white " ten@@ n@@ is club to be seen as an expression of his ties with the sp@@ a town .
A@@ c@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation office seeks face-to-face con@@ t@@ act
S@@ al@@ u@@ di@@ s and the An@@ t@@ on@@ i@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ t retirement centre have group@@ ed together under the man@@ t@@ le of a social foundation and opened a new con@@ t@@ act point on Gra@@ f@@ -@@ St@@ a@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ en@@ b@@ er@@ g@@ -@@ Plat@@ z .
In addition to ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ing advice it is also possible to participate in co@@ ur@@ s@@ es there .
The social foundation is moving down from the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in into the town centre .
More pre@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ ely , to Gra@@ f@@ -@@ St@@ a@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ en@@ b@@ er@@ g@@ -@@ Plat@@ z .
A new ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation office will be opening there shortly .
Here , directly next to the shopping centre , senior citizens and other people seeking advice can with immediate effect receive information on issues such as n@@ ur@@ s@@ ing insurance or the services of n@@ ur@@ s@@ ing and health insurance companies .
With our out@@ p@@ at@@ i@@ ent care service we have for years re@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed that family c@@ are@@ g@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s are often left alone .
This raises n@@ um@@ er@@ ou@@ s questions .
" Not in@@ fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly , too , many services provided by in@@ s@@ ur@@ ers are not used because the com@@ p@@ le@@ x@@ ity of the insurance is so difficult to understand , " the new manager , J@@ ut@@ t@@ a W@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ and , who as head of the services division for old people 's welfare is also responsible for the An@@ t@@ on@@ i@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ t and the B@@ ü@@ r@@ ger@@ sp@@ it@@ al as well as for " A@@ m@@ a@@ de@@ us " out@@ p@@ at@@ i@@ ent services , e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed .
A@@ part from advice , the new ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation office also offers co@@ ur@@ s@@ es in prevention , health and w@@ ell@@ n@@ ess .
S@@ al@@ u@@ di@@ s has been taken on board for this .
As a result , additional off@@ er@@ ings such as prevention of falls , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapy treatment are also available .
The offers from the senior citizens centre and from S@@ al@@ u@@ di@@ s com@@ p@@ le@@ ment each other per@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ ly .
S@@ al@@ u@@ di@@ s represents prevention , pre@@ c@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ on , and re@@ hab@@ il@@ itation .
" The senior citizens ' centre for care and n@@ ur@@ s@@ ing , " is how H@@ e@@ i@@ k@@ e R@@ i@@ e@@ de@@ l , man@@ ag@@ ing director of S@@ al@@ u@@ di@@ s des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es it .
Both managers see the reason behind the opening of the new ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation office in the town centre as de@@ mo@@ cr@@ at@@ i@@ c change ,
as this makes a good de@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed in@@ f@@ r@@ a@@ structure in the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts of B@@ am@@ berg es@@ sen@@ ti@@ al in the future .
Furthermore , as Mayor W@@ ol@@ f@@ g@@ an@@ g M@@ e@@ t@@ z@@ ner ( S@@ P@@ D ) un@@ der@@ l@@ in@@ ed at the opening ceremony , the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation office is also dedicated to de@@ aling with the i@@ s@@ ol@@ ation of old people . " There are n@@ um@@ er@@ ou@@ s activities and offers on the programme and these e@@ x@@ tend in@@ v@@ it@@ ations to regular social g@@ a@@ th@@ er@@ ings . "
Th@@ us the social foundation makes a big con@@ tri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on towards making senior citizens as independent as possible and towards enabling them to live well in their fam@@ ili@@ ar environment .
The ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and S@@ at@@ ur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p@@ .@@ m .

Men set upon 17@@ -year-old A@@ f@@ g@@ an
Police are seeking w@@ it@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ es to an incident in Bad S@@ o@@ den@@ -S@@ al@@ m@@ ü@@ n@@ ster . At about 1@@ 1.@@ 45 on Friday evening , three young men were w@@ al@@ king from Bad S@@ o@@ d@@ en in the direction of S@@ al@@ m@@ ü@@ n@@ ster .
According to police one of the group , a 17@@ -year-old Afghan , was w@@ al@@ king about five m@@ e@@ t@@ res behind his friends and called out to them for them to wait for him .
At this point the group were level with the b@@ f@@ t p@@ e@@ t@@ ro@@ l station .

D@@ r Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler takes over F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen practice and in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ s € 3@@ 10,000
Syl@@ vi@@ a M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ er@@ -@@ G@@ on@@ g@@ ol@@ l and Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler ( from left ) take over practice from K@@ ar@@ l@@ -@@ H@@ ein@@ rich and U@@ r@@ se@@ l F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen .
The m@@ ay@@ or of the joint community , B@@ er@@ n@@ d B@@ or@@ man@@ n , business sp@@ on@@ s@@ or U@@ t@@ a S@@ e@@ i@@ m@@ -@@ S@@ ch@@ war@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ d@@ or@@ f 's m@@ ay@@ or H@@ ein@@ fri@@ ed K@@ ab@@ b@@ er@@ t are d@@ el@@ ig@@ h@@ ted at this turn of events .
Many areas in the country have no doctor - A@@ sen@@ d@@ or@@ f by con@@ tr@@ ast is f@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ ate : on 1 October D@@ r Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler is taking over the F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen practice .
While U@@ r@@ se@@ l F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen is retiring , her husband K@@ ar@@ l@@ -@@ H@@ ein@@ rich will spend the next few months working par@@ t@@ -@@ time with his successor .
D@@ r M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler re@@ opens the practice on 12 October after a period of renovation ; by then he will have invested € 3@@ 10,000 in the pre@@ mis@@ es at St@@ .@@ -@@ Mar@@ c@@ ell@@ us@@ str@@ as@@ se 6 .
When the F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ens met Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler and his wife D@@ r Sil@@ vi@@ a M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ er@@ -@@ G@@ on@@ g@@ ol@@ l , who at the time were fin@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing their re@@ si@@ den@@ c@@ i@@ es in V@@ er@@ d@@ en hospital and also wanted to take on a practice in the next few years , they liked each other immediately
" It was always in the back of our m@@ in@@ ds that the M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ ers would fit into this practice well , " says D@@ r U@@ r@@ se@@ l F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen and l@@ a@@ u@@ gh@@ s .
" When we were read@@ y , I simply called them up . "
The M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ d@@ or@@ f in the future .
" The p@@ ro@@ xim@@ ity and the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ou@@ s con@@ t@@ act with the patients are attractive to us , " says 3@@ 9@@ -year-old M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler .
" We want to get to know the families and support them over the years . "
He also se@@ es being his own bo@@ s@@ s as a benefit .
And so it was agreed that the M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ ers would buy the h@@ ou@@ se with the practice .
However in the m@@ e@@ an@@ time they are living in B@@ ru@@ ch@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ en@@ -@@ V@@ il@@ sen .
F@@ ather of two Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler also grew up there and after his medical st@@ u@@ dies in H@@ an@@ over he worked in a number of medical p@@ r@@ ac@@ ti@@ ces as well as in h@@ o@@ sp@@ it@@ als in S@@ ul@@ in@@ gen , N@@ i@@ en@@ bur@@ g un@@ d Ro@@ ten@@ bur@@ g .
He is currently working as a consultant in S@@ ul@@ in@@ gen , fur@@ th@@ er@@ more he was a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ ted chief emergency doctor in the co@@ un@@ ty of D@@ i@@ e@@ ph@@ ol@@ z in 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 and was involved on a voluntary b@@ a@@ si@@ s in the blood don@@ ation service in B@@ ru@@ ch@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ en@@ -@@ V@@ il@@ sen .
From 19 September the practice will be pre@@ par@@ ing for the new bo@@ s@@ s .
While surgeon D@@ r K@@ ar@@ l@@ -@@ H@@ ein@@ rich F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen worked as a general p@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ er , his wife U@@ r@@ se@@ l ( a specialist in internal m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine ) spec@@ i@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed in g@@ ast@@ ro@@ ent@@ er@@ ology .
The M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ ers , both spec@@ i@@ alists in internal m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine , wanted to establish themselves as general p@@ r@@ ac@@ t@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ers .
" So it 's out with the en@@ do@@ sc@@ op@@ y , " says 3@@ 8@@ -year-old Syl@@ vi@@ a M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ er@@ -@@ G@@ on@@ g@@ ol@@ l .
After the con@@ version the rooms will look more modern .
We will offer more ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d e@@ x@@ am@@ in@@ ations as well as long-term and stress E@@ K@@ G@@ s and we need one more con@@ su@@ l@@ ting room .
The IT system will also be com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely renewed .
The M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ ers are receiving a grant to@@ t@@ all@@ ing € 5@@ 0,000 as part of a f@@ un@@ ding programme from the co@@ un@@ ty ( € 2,500 ) as well as from the joint community ( € 1@@ 2@@ ,@@ 500 ) and the local authority ( € 1@@ 2@@ ,@@ 500 ) .
" This shows how p@@ ro@@ ud and happy we are that the practice will carry on , " stressed the m@@ ay@@ or of the joint community B@@ er@@ n@@ d B@@ or@@ man@@ n .
According to Syl@@ vi@@ a M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ er@@ -@@ G@@ on@@ g@@ ol@@ l , some 2,000 patients visit the F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen practice every quarter ; in north Germany the average practice se@@ es about 500 .
There is another G@@ P practice in A@@ sen@@ d@@ or@@ f .
Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice : according to U@@ r@@ se@@ l F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen , the ch@@ em@@ ist will stay in A@@ sen@@ d@@ or@@ f .
If they ha@@ d@@ n 't found any successor , it would have closed down .
An@@ y@@ one v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ing the M@@ ü@@ l@@ l@@ ers ' surgery will also first of all see fam@@ ili@@ ar faces : they are taking over the seven medical as@@ si@@ st@@ an@@ ts and the c@@ le@@ an@@ er from the F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ens .
With their leaving , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ d@@ or@@ f ; after all the doc@@ tors have had their practice there for 30 years .
" We started with only two rooms , " re@@ members U@@ r@@ se@@ l F@@ el@@ st@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen with a g@@ r@@ in .
After such a long time she fe@@ els a little w@@ i@@ st@@ ful .
" But we 'll still be living in H@@ oh@@ en@@ mo@@ or and I 'm sure we will be seeing many of our patients often , " says the internal m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine specialist .
Her husband adds with a smile , " We 've got a 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 m ² g@@ ar@@ d@@ en . "
" U@@ p to now I haven 't done much g@@ ar@@ den@@ ing , that might change now . "
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ing .
Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a : " We are le@@ t@@ ting the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es through "
" B@@ order control is being brought in now on our southern border too , " says Interior Minister J@@ oh@@ ann@@ a Mi@@ k@@ l@@ -@@ L@@ e@@ it@@ ner .
In par@@ al@@ le@@ l , checks on the H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian border remain in place .
It is still a priority that anyone w@@ an@@ ting to claim as@@ y@@ l@@ um can " of course " do so .
The care and safety of people is par@@ amount .
It is equally clear " that obvious si@@ gn@@ als are needed , " says the minister .
People must know that we do not accept an un@@ limited flow of migration , and not over the Au@@ stri@@ an@@ -S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ian border either .
A con@@ tro@@ l@@ led procedure is re@@ qu@@ i@@ red
Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a is con@@ si@@ der@@ ing a " cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or " - S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia has refused .
The Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an government had earlier announced that S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia also wanted to let in@@ coming re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es travel through towards Au@@ stri@@ a and Germany , and also potentially establish corridors for the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
However , Interior Minister V@@ es@@ n@@ a G@@ y@@ ö@@ r@@ k@@ ö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar in La@@ ib@@ a@@ ch did not see it in quite the same light .
The idea of corridors is " absolutely un@@ acceptable , " S@@ lo@@ v@@ ein@@ a in@@ ten@@ ds rather to step up its s@@ ur@@ ve@@ ill@@ ance of the bor@@ der@@ s - especially the border to H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y .
The border with Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a , as the external border to the S@@ ch@@ en@@ gen area , is however already heavily con@@ tro@@ l@@ led .
But as the Minister stressed , S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia is not suggesting se@@ aling its bor@@ der@@ s for re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
" Every member of the EU has to f@@ ul@@ f@@ ill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , " stressed G@@ y@@ ö@@ r@@ k@@ ö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar .
According to the Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an government , the first re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es attempted to enter E@@ ast@@ er@@ n Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a on Monday night over the T@@ o@@ v@@ ar@@ n@@ ik / S@@ id border c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing , in order to avo@@ id re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation .
The Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an police were able to p@@ ick them up in the nearby m@@ a@@ ize field .
Since then , according to local media , police vehicles are con@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ ly coming across new re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an T@@ av@@ ar@@ n@@ ik .
They are mostly Sy@@ ri@@ an and A@@ f@@ gh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
The emergency se@@ v@@ i@@ c@@ es and the Red C@@ ro@@ s@@ s are also already in place .
Interior Minister R@@ an@@ ko O@@ st@@ o@@ j@@ ic says that his country is e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ting around 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in the next few days .
In addition it was reported by both Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an and Ser@@ b@@ ian media on Wednesday that buses from Pre@@ se@@ v@@ o on the Mac@@ e@@ d@@ on@@ ian@@ -S@@ er@@ b@@ ian border , which have up to now taken mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts to the H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian border , are being di@@ v@@ er@@ ted to Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a
The government in Bel@@ grade denied , however , that it is the case that they are giving people in@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tions to take certain ro@@ ut@@ es . " We neither can nor want to do that , " they st@@ ated .
According to media reports , at least one b@@ us with around 50 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es arrived in the Ser@@ b@@ ian border town of S@@ id in the early hours , and in the course of the day more buses are expected .
Over Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a , S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia and Au@@ stri@@ a to Germany
The de@@ ta@@ in@@ e@@ es were tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ing the en@@ ti@@ re night through Ser@@ b@@ ia from the Mac@@ e@@ d@@ on@@ ian border , about 500 k@@ il@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res away .
" We heard that H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y is closed , so the police said we should come here , " said one of the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
They wanted to go through Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a , S@@ lo@@ w@@ en@@ ia and Au@@ stri@@ a to get to Germany .
This im@@ p@@ li@@ es that a sh@@ i@@ f@@ t in the former B@@ al@@ k@@ an rou@@ te through T@@ ur@@ key , G@@ re@@ e@@ ce , Mac@@ e@@ d@@ on@@ ia , Ser@@ b@@ ia and H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y to a rou@@ te somewhat further to the west , which ob@@ s@@ er@@ v@@ er@@ s have already predicted , could actually now be happening .
Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a : " Wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad op@@ tions for border control "
Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an Interior Minister O@@ st@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has already pre@@ p@@ a@@ red appro@@ pri@@ ate plans for potential e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ tional s@@ it@@ u@@ ations in the event of a large in@@ f@@ lu@@ x of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
He gave no details , but he indicated that Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a , as a n@@ on-@@ member of the S@@ ch@@ en@@ gen T@@ re@@ at@@ y , has " wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad op@@ tions for border control . "
Rig@@ or@@ ou@@ s checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the S@@ ch@@ e@@ gen area .
S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia has been a member since 2007 , since when its EU par@@ t@@ ners have presented a con@@ si@@ st@@ ent@@ ly good report on the country as far as border controls are conc@@ ern@@ ed .
There are also some 300 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es st@@ u@@ ck on the Ser@@ b@@ ian side behind the H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian border fence .
According to media reports from Bel@@ grade , they spent the past night at the H@@ or@@ go@@ s border c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing , which le@@ ads to R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ k@@ e .
The H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian authorities claim that both the H@@ or@@ go@@ s and the Back@@ i Bre@@ g border c@@ ro@@ ss@@ ings also remain com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely closed .
W@@ h@@ e@@ th@@ er the remaining re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es now want to travel on to the Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an border is still not clear .
At a local appearance on Wednesday morning , the Ser@@ b@@ ian Interior Minister , N@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ j@@ s@@ a S@@ te@@ f@@ an@@ o@@ vi@@ c , tried to re@@ as@@ s@@ ure people : he con@@ si@@ der@@ s the debate on the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es ' alternative ro@@ ut@@ es after the c@@ lo@@ s@@ ure of the H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian border to be premature .
At the moment there is not a large number of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es involved .
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y , Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a or another country .
A@@ id workers advise mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts to take - dangerous - alternative ro@@ ut@@ es .
But private H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian aid workers have already started to di@@ stri@@ b@@ u@@ te m@@ a@@ p@@ s marked with alternative ro@@ ut@@ es through Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a to re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es
The border c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing between Ser@@ b@@ ia and Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a is however not without danger : in parts of the border region , even 20 years after the end of the Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an war , there are still un@@ c@@ le@@ a@@ red m@@ in@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ el@@ ds .
On Wednesday afternoon the Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an police announced that a team of m@@ in@@ es@@ w@@ e@@ ep@@ ers has been sent to the border region .
Stock exchange h@@ acker : U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ in@@ i@@ ans pay $ 30 million
Sup@@ r@@ an@@ on@@ o@@ k b@@ el@@ on@@ ged to a ring of c@@ y@@ b@@ er criminals who since 20@@ 10 have repeatedly been accused of p@@ ro@@ vi@@ ding inside vie@@ ws of as yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Bus@@ in@@ ess W@@ ir@@ e , Mark@@ e@@ t@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ w@@ ir@@ e .
The information provided en@@ ab@@ led in@@ si@@ der de@@ aling on the financial m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets .
By this m@@ e@@ ans , according to in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ at@@ ors , a to@@ t@@ al of over $ 100 million was sc@@ am@@ m@@ ed .
" C@@ ur@@ rent information in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ es that even those outside our national bor@@ der@@ s have finally been caught , " an SEC report states .

The E@@ c@@ um@@ en@@ ical Ho@@ sp@@ i@@ c@@ e Care or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation is carrying out this campaign to raise awareness of their 20@@ th anniversary , and is en@@ counter@@ ing extremely m@@ i@@ x@@ ed re@@ actions .
" It 's about life , which is why we are carrying out this campaign in the middle of the town , right among the people , " says J@@ o@@ se@@ fine Lam@@ m@@ er .
The head of E@@ c@@ um@@ en@@ ical Ho@@ sp@@ i@@ c@@ e Care is also available to answer questions from and have discussions with p@@ as@@ s@@ er@@ s-@@ by , as are voluntary workers .
While many p@@ as@@ s@@ er@@ s-@@ by impul@@ si@@ v@@ ely grab the ch@@ al@@ k and complete the sentence with " aff@@ ir@@ m my life , " " be able to read , " " drive through the USA in a camp@@ er van , " " stop war " or " not su@@ f@@ f@@ er for long , " others stop b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly , read , say things like " I 'm not read@@ y for that yet , " and carry on .
A@@ g@@ a@@ in and again little discussions develop in cor@@ ners about the campaign itself , about life , about de@@ aling with d@@ y@@ ing .
Peter H@@ ü@@ b@@ in@@ g@@ er is also there now .
" It 's only when I consider that some day the end of this world is going to come for me that I can live re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ly , " says the Di@@ rec@@ tor of the Pro@@ te@@ st@@ ant social char@@ ity Di@@ ak@@ on@@ i@@ s@@ chen W@@ er@@ k in M@@ ann@@ heim , which is a responsible body along with the Car@@ it@@ as Association for E@@ c@@ um@@ en@@ ical Ho@@ sp@@ i@@ c@@ e Care .
Which is why these high v@@ i@@ s@@ ib@@ ility camp@@ a@@ ig@@ n@@ s are good for the 20@@ -year-old or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation .
Of course it 's un@@ der@@ stand@@ able that not everyone wants to share their m@@ es@@ s@@ age p@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ly on the b@@ l@@ ack@@ bo@@ ar@@ ds ; in the end it 's a very per@@ s@@ on@@ al matter .
The t@@ op@@ ics of life and death are still st@@ e@@ ep@@ ed in t@@ ab@@ oo@@ s , according to J@@ o@@ se@@ fine Lam@@ m@@ er 's experience , although the h@@ o@@ sp@@ i@@ c@@ e movement even over the last few years has done much to help people to accept it .

F@@ e@@ d@@ E@@ x e@@ ar@@ n@@ ings m@@ i@@ x@@ ed , lo@@ wers fiscal 20@@ 16 out@@ look
F@@ e@@ d@@ E@@ x reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery g@@ i@@ ant cut its full-year profit fo@@ rec@@ ast on w@@ e@@ ak@@ er demand for fre@@ ig@@ h@@ t services and higher costs in its ground division .
The company also said it plans to h@@ ir@@ e about 5@@ 5,000 se@@ as@@ on@@ al workers for the h@@ o@@ li@@ days .
At this time last year , F@@ e@@ d@@ E@@ x announced it would h@@ ir@@ e 5@@ 0,000 se@@ as@@ on@@ al workers for the h@@ o@@ li@@ days .
Its shares fell about 2.@@ 5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday 's opening b@@ el@@ l .
F@@ e@@ d@@ E@@ x Cor@@ p@@ . said that it expects to e@@ ar@@ n between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 cents from an earlier prediction .
Analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a s@@ ur@@ v@@ ey by Fac@@ t@@ S@@ et .
The reduced out@@ look comes despite rate h@@ i@@ k@@ es aver@@ ag@@ ing 4.@@ 9 percent , which will take effect J@@ an@@ . 4 , and higher s@@ ur@@ charges for ground sh@@ i@@ p@@ ment of heavy or large p@@ ack@@ ag@@ es , which begin in November .
The company said it still expects e@@ ar@@ n@@ ings to grow over the previous year because of co@@ st@@ -@@ c@@ ut@@ ting , higher revenue and growth in online com@@ mer@@ ce .
Chairman and CEO F@@ red Smith said the company was " per@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ing so@@ li@@ d@@ ly given w@@ e@@ ak@@ er-@@ th@@ an-@@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . "
The h@@ o@@ li@@ d@@ ay@@ -@@ h@@ ir@@ ing plans were announced a day after rival U@@ P@@ S said that that it plans to h@@ ir@@ e 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 e@@ x@@ tra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31 , F@@ e@@ d@@ E@@ x earned $ 6@@ 92 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
Earnings per share am@@ oun@@ ted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average fo@@ rec@@ ast of 12 an@@ al@@ y@@ st@@ s surveyed by Z@@ ac@@ ks In@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ment Research .
Re@@ ven@@ ue rose 5 percent , to $ 1@@ 2.@@ 3 billion .
Six an@@ al@@ y@@ st@@ s surveyed by Z@@ ac@@ ks expected $ 1@@ 2.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ e@@ d@@ E@@ x has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international sh@@ i@@ p@@ p@@ ing , which has caused revenue in its Ex@@ press unit to st@@ ag@@ n@@ ate .
But the b@@ oo@@ m in online shopping has b@@ oo@@ sted results at F@@ e@@ d@@ E@@ x Gro@@ un@@ d .
In the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 2@@ 9 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger p@@ ack@@ ag@@ es and self-@@ insurance .
The e@@ x@@ press unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the fre@@ ig@@ h@@ t business on higher labor costs .
In pre@@ market trading about an hour before the opening b@@ el@@ l , F@@ e@@ d@@ E@@ x shares were down $ 3@@ .@@ 85 , or 2.@@ 5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
At their most an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ated meeting in years , Federal Reserve po@@ li@@ c@@ y@@ m@@ ak@@ ers will spend two days this week se@@ ated around a 27@@ -@@ foot H@@ on@@ dur@@ an m@@ ah@@ o@@ g@@ an@@ y table de@@ c@@ i@@ ding if it 's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a de@@ c@@ a@@ de .
Lo@@ o@@ m@@ ing over them at one end of the central b@@ an@@ k 's or@@ n@@ ate , two-@@ story bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ o@@ m will be a m@@ ur@@ al of the United States .
The m@@ a@@ p is a re@@ m@@ in@@ der that Fed Cha@@ ir@@ woman J@@ an@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are su@@ p@@ posed to put the nation 's economic interests above all others .
The central b@@ an@@ k has a du@@ al charge from Congress : m@@ a@@ xim@@ ize U.S. em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment and keep prices here st@@ able .
But since the Great Rec@@ es@@ si@@ on , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there 's an un@@ w@@ r@@ it@@ ten third m@@ an@@ d@@ ate : financial st@@ ability .
And that third m@@ an@@ d@@ ate could be the X@@ -@@ factor in a too-@@ c@@ lo@@ se@@ -@@ to-@@ pre@@ di@@ c@@ t decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U.S. economy is read@@ y to start being w@@ e@@ an@@ ed from the un@@ pre@@ c@@ e@@ d@@ ent@@ ed stimul@@ us provided by the ne@@ ar@@ -@@ zer@@ o short@@ -@@ term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
Even though most data show the economy growing so@@ li@@ d@@ ly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in global financial m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets could make al@@ read@@ y-@@ cautious Fed officials sk@@ it@@ t@@ ish about adding to the v@@ ol@@ at@@ ility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a per@@ c@@ ent@@ age point .
" O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and fore@@ most the most important thing they watch , " said Lin@@ d@@ sey M@@ . Pie@@ g@@ z@@ a , chief e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ist at bro@@ k@@ er@@ age firm S@@ ti@@ f@@ el N@@ i@@ c@@ ol@@ a@@ u@@ s & Co .
" But I think if they were looking for an e@@ x@@ c@@ use not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unding the global m@@ ar@@ k@@ e@@ t@@ place is enough to provide them with j@@ u@@ st@@ ific@@ ation to wait further , " she said .
There 's no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ing financial market j@@ it@@ ters .
About half of e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ists surveyed recently by B@@ lo@@ o@@ m@@ berg predicted a rate increase this week .
Financial m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets , however , are e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , un@@ less po@@ li@@ c@@ y@@ m@@ ak@@ ers were to so@@ f@@ ten the b@@ low by p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ing that another increase would be a ways off .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones in@@ du@@ stri@@ al average jumped 2@@ 2@@ 8@@ .@@ 89 points , or 1.@@ 4 % , to 16@@ ,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 85 .
The rally was tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ed by expectations that Fed po@@ li@@ c@@ y@@ m@@ ak@@ ers will hold the rate steady this week , said John L@@ on@@ sk@@ i , chief e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy 's Capital Mark@@ ets Research Group .
" It would be a surprise if the Fed h@@ i@@ k@@ ed rates at this point in time , " he said .
If Fed po@@ li@@ c@@ y@@ m@@ ak@@ ers did , " they would have to go to great l@@ eng@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets ' hands so they don 't panic . "
Other experts ar@@ g@@ u@@ ed that a rate increase would c@@ al@@ m financial m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets because it would re@@ move uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 per@@ c@@ ent@@ age point this month , the first small step in a s@@ low ti@@ ghten@@ ing of m@@ on@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y conditions that would v@@ al@@ i@@ date the strength of the U.S. recovery .
Y@@ ellen had said through the sp@@ r@@ ing and early su@@ m@@ m@@ er that she expected a rate increase this year despite com@@ pl@@ ain@@ ts from liberals that more economic progress was needed .
Although job c@@ re@@ ation s@@ lo@@ w@@ ed in August , labor market growth has been so@@ li@@ d this year .
The un@@ em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment rate dropped to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed con@@ si@@ der@@ s to be full em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
W@@ age g@@ ain@@ s have sh@@ own signs of p@@ i@@ c@@ king up .
And although inflation con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed to run below the central b@@ an@@ k 's annual 2 % target , Fed po@@ li@@ c@@ y@@ m@@ ak@@ ers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
The economy " can cop@@ e with higher rates , and ne@@ e@@ ds them , given the ti@@ gh@@ t@@ n@@ ess of the labor market , " said Ian She@@ p@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ist at P@@ an@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics .
But financial m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets around the world started con@@ v@@ ul@@ sing late last month after China de@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ed its currency .
The Dow Jones in@@ du@@ stri@@ al average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ors fe@@ a@@ red a s@@ lo@@ w@@ ing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
The market has re@@ bo@@ unded somewhat this month , with the Dow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
For Fed po@@ li@@ c@@ y@@ m@@ ak@@ ers , the market tur@@ mo@@ il adds to the complex c@@ al@@ c@@ ul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
" Ab@@ sent what ha@@ p@@ p@@ en@@ ed in financial m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets and the news about the w@@ e@@ ak@@ n@@ ess in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be ti@@ ghten@@ ing at this meeting , " said Stephen D. O@@ l@@ in@@ er , a senior research fellow at the UCLA Zim@@ an Center for Real E@@ state and a former Fed official .
Now , he pre@@ di@@ c@@ ts they 'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
" There 's a lot of uncertainty about what the im@@ p@@ acts on the U.S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to re@@ ly on that po@@ st@@ -@@ dates the developments in China , " O@@ l@@ in@@ er said .
The health of the global economy isn 't one of the Fed 's primary concerns , so te@@ ch@@ n@@ ically it sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't be f@@ ac@@ to@@ red into its de@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on-@@ making .
But , in effect , the Fed has become the m@@ on@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y authority of the world .
The central b@@ an@@ k 's influence in recent years has been enormous .
The mere h@@ in@@ t by th@@ en@@ -@@ Chairman Ben S@@ . Bernanke in 20@@ 13 that the Fed might " t@@ a@@ p@@ er " its m@@ on@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y e@@ x@@ p@@ an@@ si@@ on tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ed market con@@ v@@ ul@@ sions around the g@@ lo@@ be .
In a world where m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets and e@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ in@@ ed , Fed officials can be expected not only to m@@ on@@ itor the developments elsewhere but also to con@@ su@@ l@@ t with other central b@@ an@@ k@@ ers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
Its de@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on-@@ making process is " more art than science , " said Z@@ a@@ ch@@ ar@@ y K@@ ar@@ ab@@ el@@ l , head of global strategy for w@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ -@@ management firm En@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ net Inc .
J@@ eff@@ re@@ y L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of R@@ ich@@ mond , Va . , noted this month that " the Fed has a history of over@@ re@@ ac@@ ting to financial market movements that seem un@@ con@@ ne@@ c@@ ted to economic f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ als . "
L@@ acker , a voting member of the po@@ li@@ c@@ y@@ making Federal O@@ p@@ en Mark@@ et Committee who has been p@@ ush@@ ing for a rate increase , c@@ it@@ ed de@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on@@ s in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 8-@@ 99 as an example .
A financial crisis in A@@ si@@ a led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.@@ 75 per@@ c@@ ent@@ age point over three meetings " despite limited i@@ den@@ ti@@ fi@@ able im@@ p@@ lic@@ ations for U.S. growth , " L@@ acker said .
A year later , Fed officials re@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ed those cuts .
The Fed should put financial st@@ ability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market mel@@ t@@ down , said Ad@@ am S@@ . Po@@ sen , a former member of the Bank of England 's r@@ at@@ e-@@ se@@ t@@ ting com@@ mit@@ tee .
The latest tur@@ mo@@ il doesn 't come close to that level , he said .
" You certainly don 't want to be put in a situation of being sc@@ a@@ red of a rate hike because m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets got u@@ p@@ set , " said Po@@ sen , president of the Peterson Institute for International E@@ con@@ o@@ m@@ ics .
The Federal Reserve Act still has the du@@ al m@@ an@@ d@@ ate and does not men@@ ti@@ on financial st@@ ability , and until that is changed , I don 't think they should get ahead of the cur@@ v@@ e .

However , new research suggests that increasing c@@ al@@ or@@ ie in@@ take is not the only di@@ e@@ t@@ ar@@ y adjust@@ ment mothers should make .
A recent study conducted by Robert W@@ at@@ er@@ land , a p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ s@@ or at the Bay@@ l@@ or College of Me@@ di@@ c@@ ine in Texas revealed that h@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y di@@ ets of pre@@ gn@@ ant women actually affected the gen@@ etic expression of their babies and p@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ ted them from developing t@@ um@@ ors .

Ex@@ c@@ ep@@ tions for the new B@@ er@@ n@@ ri@@ ed sp@@ or@@ ts h@@ all
B@@ er@@ n@@ ri@@ ed di@@ stri@@ c@@ t council has approved the planning app@@ lic@@ ation for the € 2.@@ 3 million sp@@ or@@ ts h@@ all .
And it is making an e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ on .
The ro@@ of may be flat@@ ter to accommodate a sol@@ ar energy system .
P@@ l@@ anning for the long-@@ a@@ wa@@ it@@ ed sp@@ or@@ ts building on the B@@ er@@ n@@ ri@@ ed sp@@ or@@ ts ground are moving ahead step by step : in the latest council meeting the planning app@@ lic@@ ation was approved un@@ anim@@ ously without any great discussion .
The com@@ mit@@ tee had earlier agreed , among other things , to an " e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ on , " or rather an " e@@ x@@ em@@ p@@ ti@@ on " under building law to the app@@ lic@@ able building plan .
The " e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ on " re@@ f@@ ers to per@@ mission for a special shape for the ro@@ of structure .
According to this a " g@@ able ro@@ of with an off@@ -@@ centre ri@@ dge and ro@@ of over@@ h@@ an@@ g " will be con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ted .
The background for the plan is the planned use of the ro@@ of surface for sol@@ ar p@@ an@@ els . " This m@@ e@@ ans we will have a w@@ on@@ der@@ fully large sou@@ th-@@ facing ro@@ of , " e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed m@@ ay@@ or J@@ o@@ se@@ f St@@ e@@ i@@ gen@@ b@@ er@@ ger at the meeting .
The " e@@ x@@ em@@ p@@ ti@@ on " on the other hand re@@ f@@ ers to the ro@@ of pitch , which for energy re@@ as@@ on@@ s - con@@ tr@@ ar@@ y to the st@@ i@@ p@@ ulations in the development plan - will be less than 10 de@@ g@@ re@@ es .
This will reduce the volume of the h@@ all .
Th@@ er@@ e@@ f@@ or@@ e an " e@@ x@@ em@@ p@@ ti@@ on " is necessary , since the development plan allows no " e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ tions " with re@@ g@@ ar@@ d to ro@@ of pitch - while the B@@ er@@ n@@ ri@@ ed council as a rule has a more re@@ stri@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ e approach to re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s for e@@ x@@ em@@ p@@ tions .
The sp@@ or@@ ts h@@ all is however more of a recurring project . " We are not se@@ t@@ ting a pre@@ ce@@ dent with this , " says St@@ e@@ i@@ gen@@ b@@ er@@ ger .
The h@@ all at the sp@@ or@@ ts centre is a joint project between the di@@ stri@@ c@@ t and S@@ V B@@ er@@ n@@ ri@@ ed .
C@@ o@@ st@@ s have been c@@ al@@ c@@ ul@@ ated at around € 2.@@ 3 million .
Con@@ tri@@ b@@ u@@ tions are expected through f@@ un@@ ding from schools and popular sp@@ or@@ ts .
In the next step of the project , the planning app@@ lic@@ ation for the 18 x 36 m@@ e@@ t@@ re h@@ all will be presented to the di@@ stri@@ c@@ t administration for re@@ view .

At the same time D@@ r Wil@@ h@@ el@@ m F@@ i@@ s@@ cher ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the S@@ ch@@ on@@ g@@ au Hospital .
The war@@ ds and the majority of employees are moving to S@@ ch@@ on@@ g@@ au from Pe@@ i@@ s@@ sen@@ berg .
This allows for the di@@ stri@@ c@@ t 's limited company hospital 's surprising plans , con@@ f@@ ir@@ ms di@@ stri@@ c@@ t ad@@ m@@ in@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ at@@ or Andre@@ a J@@ o@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Weiss .
The Board of Di@@ rec@@ tors , however , will come to a decision about this and they meet next Wednesday , 23 September .
If these plans are implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pe@@ i@@ s@@ sen@@ berg will remain in em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment .
The v@@ ast majority will move with F@@ i@@ s@@ cher and the internal m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine ward that still continues to exist to S@@ ch@@ on@@ g@@ au .
The pre@@ mis@@ es are available .
Those employees who are not able to go to S@@ ch@@ on@@ g@@ au will be offered po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s in We@@ il@@ heim , according to J@@ o@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Weiss .
Employees have been in@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ed about the plans .
The changes were tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ed by the re@@ si@@ gn@@ ation of D@@ r Andreas E@@ der , who has been clinical director of the S@@ ch@@ on@@ g@@ au c@@ l@@ in@@ ic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate v@@ i@@ c@@ in@@ ity of the hospital .
When the question of who his successor should be , according to J@@ o@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Weiss , the name of " F@@ i@@ s@@ cher , " who had de@@ c@@ la@@ red that he was pre@@ p@@ a@@ red to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to S@@ ch@@ on@@ g@@ au , was raised .
For the S@@ ch@@ on@@ g@@ au hospital , these changes mean an " u@@ p@@ grade " and an e@@ x@@ p@@ an@@ si@@ on of the services offered in the field of internal m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine , says J@@ o@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Weiss .
Fisher is a specialist in car@@ di@@ a@@ c p@@ ac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers and de@@ fi@@ b@@ r@@ ill@@ at@@ ors .
S@@ ch@@ on@@ g@@ au ( 180 be@@ ds ) spec@@ i@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ es in g@@ ast@@ ro@@ ent@@ er@@ ological disorders in its internal m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine department .
In the trans@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ar@@ y period over the next two years F@@ i@@ s@@ cher and his team , if the Board of Management ag@@ re@@ es to this , will run both e@@ st@@ ab@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ments , and in the next year the former m@@ in@@ ers ' hospital in Pe@@ i@@ s@@ sen@@ berg , which still has over 35 be@@ ds , will finally be closed after almost 1@@ 40 years .
Th@@ us far the di@@ stri@@ c@@ t has planned this for 20@@ 18 , when the currently ongoing re@@ st@@ or@@ ation of the We@@ il@@ heim hospital is finished .
D@@ i@@ st@@ ri@@ c@@ t ad@@ m@@ in@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ at@@ or J@@ o@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Board of Management , con@@ tra@@ di@@ c@@ ts rumours that the building , which is owned by the Federal Association for Min@@ ers , will in the future be used as ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation for as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers .
" I can rule that out . " What will happen to the building , J@@ o@@ ch@@ n@@ er-@@ Weiss cannot say ; that ne@@ e@@ ds more con@@ si@@ der@@ ation .
At the moment a Car@@ it@@ as short@@ -@@ term care f@@ ac@@ ility and a d@@ ay@@ time p@@ sy@@ chi@@ at@@ ri@@ c f@@ ac@@ ility are housed there .
" It 's the best thing that could have ha@@ p@@ p@@ en@@ ed for us ; we won 't get this sort of opportunity again , " says F@@ i@@ s@@ cher about the move to the Le@@ ch , which has been accepted " po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ely and with understanding " by employees .
Real p@@ ro@@ spec@@ ts for the building where F@@ i@@ s@@ cher has worked for over 30 years as chief physician do not really exist .
He was asked by his colleagues at S@@ ch@@ on@@ g@@ au to take over the post of medical director .
The P@@ i@@ es@@ sen@@ berg hospital , which once had 100 be@@ ds , has been con@@ st@@ an@@ t@@ ly under threat of c@@ lo@@ s@@ ure over the last decades . De@@ par@@ t@@ ments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ e@@ t@@ ri@@ c@@ s .
The h@@ an@@ d@@ ball@@ ers of R@@ h@@ ein@@ -@@ N@@ ec@@ k@@ ar L@@ ö@@ w@@ en are being challenged this evening ( 8 : 15 p.m. ) at B@@ er@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ cher H@@ C .
The leaders of the B@@ un@@ des@@ li@@ g@@ a are the clear f@@ a@@ vo@@ ur@@ it@@ es in W@@ u@@ p@@ per@@ t@@ al , however there are no gro@@ un@@ ds for ar@@ ro@@ g@@ an@@ ce .
In the past season the B@@ a@@ d@@ en team suffered a painful de@@ fe@@ at at B@@ H@@ C and they have some ground to make up there .
Two injured in hun@@ ting accident near P@@ r@@ at@@ au
Two trac@@ tor drivers were seriously injured when they were shot during the m@@ a@@ ize har@@ v@@ est on Tuesday af@@ ter@@ n@@ o@@ o@@ on .
A number of hun@@ t@@ s@@ men were in action on a corn field near P@@ r@@ at@@ au ( W@@ it@@ ten@@ bur@@ g di@@ stri@@ c@@ t ) during the har@@ v@@ est , according to police .
After shots were fired , two men , one 6@@ 3 and the other 22 , suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospital .
The pre@@ c@@ ise cause of the accident was initially unclear .
C@@ ri@@ m@@ in@@ al in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ at@@ ors are trying to determine the details .
M@@ i@@ s@@ sing 16@@ -year-old from R@@ h@@ in@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine the victim of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of a 16@@ -year-old from R@@ h@@ in@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine who has been missing since Saturday .
When questioned the 20@@ -year-old ad@@ mit@@ ted to having killed the teenager and thrown her body into a can@@ al in Ro@@ ck@@ en@@ hau@@ sen .
S@@ i@@ x@@ te@@ en@@ -@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old missing from R@@ h@@ in@@ el@@ and-@@ Pal@@ at@@ ine since Saturday is the victim of a violent crime .
The body of a young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Ro@@ ck@@ en@@ hau@@ sen near K@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ er@@ s@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ ter@@ n the public p@@ ro@@ se@@ c@@ ut@@ or 's office and police reported on Wednesday .
A 20@@ -year-old suspect , who con@@ f@@ essed to the crime and led in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ at@@ ors to the site where the body was found , was arrested also on Tuesday evening .
The 16@@ -year-old was reported as missing Sunday morning when she did not return home as agreed after at@@ ten@@ ding an a@@ u@@ t@@ um@@ n party in Ro@@ ck@@ en@@ hau@@ sen .
In their search for the young woman , in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ at@@ ors initially found per@@ s@@ on@@ al items b@@ el@@ on@@ ging to the victim .
In@@ ter@@ vie@@ ws with the missing g@@ ir@@ l 's c@@ ir@@ c@@ le of friends and ac@@ qu@@ ain@@ tan@@ ces ultimately resulted in 20@@ -year-old becoming a suspect .

Further investigation is being carried out regarding details of the exact circumstances of the crime
Re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es need ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation : study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense
And more and more re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es are seeking an affordable place to stay .
P@@ re@@ s@@ sure on the housing market is growing .
S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al housing is facing a challenge .
The st@@ ru@@ g@@ g@@ le for al@@ locations in the German housing market began long ago .
With the arrival of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es and job se@@ e@@ k@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are crowding into a market which in many large towns is already over@@ bur@@ den@@ ed .
They are competing with residents on low in@@ comes for the last affordable homes .
To supply the demand for affordable homes , 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 new units must be built every year up to 20@@ 20 .
This is the conclusion re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed by a study com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed by the " S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Housing " fe@@ der@@ ation of associations .
In com@@ par@@ i@@ s@@ on , 2@@ 6@@ 0,000 units were completed in this year in Germany .
This amounts to a short@@ fall of 1@@ 4@@ 0,000 homes .
After the first three months of their stay , re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es are no longer ob@@ li@@ ged to live as as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers in initial reception ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation .
Many then p@@ ush onto the housing market and st@@ and in long qu@@ e@@ u@@ es in front of r@@ ent@@ al flat@@ s .
According to the German Federal St@@ at@@ i@@ st@@ ical Office , however , in the last year fewer than half of all as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers have lived as ten@@ an@@ ts .
The negative development in the housing market , however , is not just due to the increasing numbers of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
The study points to significant f@@ a@@ il@@ ings in housing policy over the last year .
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year .
There is a current short@@ fall in urban areas of around 7@@ 7@@ 0,000 living units lam@@ ent@@ s M@@ at@@ th@@ i@@ as G@@ ü@@ n@@ th@@ er , a@@ u@@ th@@ or of the study .
This is why many p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als in large towns are forced to live in flat shares .
D@@ ue to the sl@@ um@@ p in the housing market , young ad@@ ul@@ ts of ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ity live longer in " Ho@@ te@@ l M@@ ama . "
In large towns over the last few years , the number of square m@@ e@@ t@@ res per head has de@@ c@@ re@@ ased for the first time .
In order to sol@@ v@@ e the problem , the " S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ al Housing " alliance suggests a fresh start .
New incentives should re@@ vi@@ v@@ e social housing .
For example land transfer tax could be wa@@ i@@ v@@ ed and the land tax for sp@@ on@@ so@@ red housing te@@ m@@ p@@ or@@ ar@@ il@@ y suspended .
In addition , according to the association , attractive tax de@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ation po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ es are necessary .
The K@@ f@@ W state b@@ an@@ k 's refugee f@@ un@@ ding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities .
On Monday evening , a good week after start of the programme , € 18@@ 4 million - more than half of the around € 300 million which had been made available - had already been re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ ed .
The project may now even be st@@ e@@ pped up .
Re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es have sa@@ f@@ e conduct : Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a and S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia put cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or in place
Since H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y has v@@ ir@@ tu@@ ally st@@ op@@ p@@ ed le@@ t@@ ting them through , the choice of more and more re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es is the rou@@ te over Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a .
Z@@ ag@@ re@@ b has announced that they will al@@ low pass@@ age over S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia towards the north without ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es .
However the rou@@ te is dangerous .
Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a wants to come to an agreement with n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ ing S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia about the establishment of a cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or for re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
" I have sp@@ o@@ ken to the S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ian Minister for the Interior , and if necessary we will or@@ g@@ an@@ ise a cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , " said Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an Minister for the Interior R@@ an@@ ko O@@ st@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
S@@ lo@@ ven@@ ia li@@ es between Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a and Au@@ stri@@ a and already b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ s to the S@@ ch@@ en@@ gen zone .
EU member Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a is not yet a S@@ ch@@ en@@ gen country .
After the se@@ aling off of the Ser@@ b@@ ian H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian border , hundreds of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es set out for Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a in order to reach West Europe from there .
F@@ i@@ v@@ e hundred people came over the border at T@@ o@@ v@@ ar@@ n@@ ik , reports Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an television station RT@@ L .
H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y had c@@ or@@ d@@ on@@ ed off its bor@@ der@@ s for re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es the previous day .
Mo@@ re@@ over , new la@@ ws which came into force on the same day make fair as@@ y@@ l@@ um p@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ ings in H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y p@@ r@@ ac@@ tic@@ ally red@@ und@@ ant .
Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a wants to let the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es pass through .
The Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an Prime Minister Z@@ or@@ an M@@ il@@ an@@ o@@ vi@@ c explains , " They may pass through and we are pre@@ par@@ ing ourselves for this po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ility . "
These people are there , they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
They are however people who do not want to live in Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a .
The Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an police p@@ i@@ c@@ ked up the first re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es on the Ser@@ b@@ ian border to EU n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ our Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a in the morning .
According to media reports most come from Syria , Iran and A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an .
They arrived at the Ser@@ b@@ ian border town of S@@ id both by b@@ us and in ta@@ x@@ is .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after their arrival they tried to reach the g@@ re@@ en border to Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a on foot .
At the Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an@@ -S@@ er@@ b@@ ian border the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es did not come across border fences .
The border stri@@ ps hold other d@@ ang@@ ers : there are still active mines there from the Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ la@@ vi@@ an civil war in the 9@@ 0@@ s .
It is now planned for m@@ in@@ es@@ w@@ e@@ ep@@ ers to quickly create a sa@@ f@@ e pass@@ age .
Me@@ an@@ while after the c@@ lo@@ s@@ ure of the border har@@ d@@ ly any more re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es come to H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y .
On Tuesday police counted 366 people that they had p@@ i@@ c@@ ked up .
Sh@@ or@@ t@@ ly before the c@@ lo@@ s@@ ing of the gate on Monday the number was 9@@ ,@@ 3@@ 80 .
The new H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian la@@ ws c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fy clim@@ b@@ ing and d@@ am@@ ag@@ ing the border fences as criminal off@@ en@@ ces .
This has led to 35 criminal p@@ ro@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ ings being in@@ it@@ i@@ ated in the South H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian border town of S@@ z@@ eg@@ ed .
Those con@@ v@@ i@@ c@@ ted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and e@@ x@@ tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on from the country .
According to the immigration authorities , a to@@ t@@ al of 9@@ 4 as@@ y@@ l@@ um applications was accepted in the new " trans@@ it@@ i@@ on zone " set up at the border , almost all - 9@@ 3 - at the biggest c@@ ro@@ s@@ sing at R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ k@@ e .
Among the app@@ lic@@ an@@ ts were 13 families with small children and two older people .
On Wednesday morning another 40 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es were st@@ op@@ p@@ ed there .
In practice , however , n@@ o@@ body else has a chance of being granted as@@ y@@ l@@ um in H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y .
According to opinion in H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y , Ser@@ b@@ ia is " a sa@@ f@@ e third country . "
The re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers will be de@@ p@@ or@@ ted there .
Only a few hundred re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es now are g@@ a@@ th@@ er@@ ing by " the trans@@ it@@ i@@ on zone " in R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ k@@ e .
Workers have begun to c@@ le@@ an up in R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ k@@ e .
They are c@@ olle@@ c@@ ting the rub@@ bish that ten@@ s of thousands of people have left l@@ y@@ ing at the sides of the roads over the last weeks .
Cro@@ w@@ d barriers are being di@@ s@@ man@@ t@@ led and one of the reception c@@ ent@@ res in the border town is being re@@ built .
No one wants to talk about the goal of this rebuilding .
After the c@@ lo@@ s@@ ure of the border between Ser@@ b@@ ia and H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y , Au@@ stri@@ a is getting only a few re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
Furthermore the country has strengthened its border controls .
According to the go@@ v@@ er@@ ment , around 20,000 mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts are still in the country .
In S@@ al@@ z@@ bur@@ g , some 1,@@ 4@@ 00 people are waiting to travel on to Germany .
The train service from there to Germany was st@@ op@@ p@@ ed in the morning on the in@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tions of the German authorities .
In Fre@@ il@@ as@@ s@@ ing one regularly m@@ e@@ ets small groups of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es on foot .
Mayor drives " str@@ an@@ d@@ ed people " over the border
" We were b@@ us@@ y cleaning up after the Bridge F@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ v@@ al on Sunday , when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the t@@ ent with su@@ it@@ cases , " says Mayor of W@@ ern@@ stein A@@ lo@@ is St@@ ad@@ ler .
T@@ o@@ ur@@ ists who wanted to get to P@@ as@@ sa@@ u by train .
Because Germany had un@@ e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ te@@ d@@ ly st@@ op@@ p@@ ed train services to Au@@ stri@@ a on Sunday due to the in@@ f@@ lu@@ x of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es , their journey had come to a halt in W@@ ern@@ stein , " says St@@ ad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and together with two other h@@ el@@ p@@ ers and their cars ch@@ a@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ u@@ red the str@@ an@@ d@@ ed people over the border to P@@ as@@ sa@@ u .
Be@@ f@@ or@@ e that we ent@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ed our surprise g@@ u@@ e@@ st@@ s with s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks and d@@ r@@ in@@ ks .
We said at once that we would take them to P@@ as@@ sa@@ u by car .
" It was a matter of course for us , " says St@@ ad@@ ler , talking to O@@ Ö@@ N .
They were very g@@ r@@ at@@ eful .
One man insisted on handing over a gen@@ er@@ ou@@ s don@@ ation - € 100 for the fire bri@@ g@@ a@@ de .
" We were very p@@ le@@ ased about that , " says St@@ ad@@ ler .
The str@@ an@@ d@@ ed train passengers had changed trains in W@@ el@@ s on Sunday evening from an I@@ C@@ E train to a regional train to P@@ as@@ sa@@ u after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended , in an attempt to c@@ ro@@ s@@ s the border anyway .
But the regional train was st@@ op@@ p@@ ed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am In@@ n .
In W@@ ern@@ stein , e@@ x@@ cur@@ sions over the border are generally very popular .
The Bridge F@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ v@@ al is a joint effort between W@@ ern@@ stein and B@@ av@@ ar@@ i@@ ans from Ne@@ u@@ k@@ ir@@ chen ; the Bridge F@@ e@@ st@@ i@@ v@@ al Association or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ es the social event on Sunday and an a@@ th@@ le@@ tic two bri@@ dge walk the day before with their B@@ av@@ ar@@ ian n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ s .
The fact that V@@ i@@ k@@ tor Or@@ b@@ á@@ n is sen@@ ding us ten@@ s of thousands more is a lo@@ g@@ ical result of his h@@ y@@ po@@ c@@ r@@ it@@ ical po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es :
In@@ st@@ e@@ ad of p@@ ro@@ vi@@ ding immediate help to the R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ k@@ e camp by con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ting st@@ ru@@ c@@ tu@@ res which ensure a level of h@@ um@@ an@@ ity , our Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or has officially and p@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ly mo@@ v@@ ed the H@@ ung@@ ar@@ ian government 's st@@ ance closer to an atmosphere of national so@@ c@@ i@@ alism .
It is not only those Au@@ stri@@ ans who are now con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ted with ch@@ a@@ o@@ tic conditions in the border areas who are v@@ i@@ c@@ tim@@ s of the policy .
Those who have f@@ led , too , must notice that the " p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed land " which had invited and welcomed them is not considered another refugee camp .
It will be a huge challenge , in the light of the continuing flow of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es and the appro@@ a@@ ch@@ ing winter , to create h@@ um@@ ane conditions for as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers .
There is a still greater one - maintaining peace , security and st@@ ability in Au@@ stri@@ a .
K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d is looking for w@@ inter@@ -@@ p@@ ro@@ of ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation for 3@@ 5,000
K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d has his hands full with the h@@ o@@ st@@ ing of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ian K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d is used to the fact that his word carries weight .
The government has engaged the former powerful R@@ ai@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ i@@ s@@ en b@@ an@@ ker to establish ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation for thousands of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d has already got to g@@ ri@@ ps with the ch@@ a@@ os in the T@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ k@@ ir@@ chen reception centre .
" We no longer have any h@@ o@@ m@@ el@@ ess people in T@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ k@@ ir@@ chen , " he reported on his first achievement .
And the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation of the 20,000 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es who arrived in Au@@ stri@@ a on Monday ha@@ p@@ p@@ en@@ ed without any great f@@ us@@ s , said K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d , p@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ ing the or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ational " m@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ piece . "
The Minister of the Interior , however , talked of a " c@@ r@@ it@@ ical situation . "
In to@@ t@@ al , K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d e@@ st@@ im@@ at@@ es that ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation for 8@@ 5,000 will be re@@ qu@@ i@@ red in the current year .
In order to meet this figure , ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation for another 3@@ 5,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 to be provided for by the states and 15@@ ,000 by the federal government .
If there are more re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es , we can man@@ age .
" But it is not a bott@@ o@@ m@@ less p@@ it , " says K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d .
He has already carried out talks with the State Go@@ v@@ er@@ n@@ ors .
They have as@@ su@@ red him that ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation will also be found for the next re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es to arrive .
" It is going well in Au@@ stri@@ a , " says F@@ er@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
The former V@@ P m@@ an@@ d@@ at@@ ar@@ y is as@@ si@@ st@@ ing K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d .
T@@ o@@ m@@ or@@ row there will be a meeting with Car@@ d@@ in@@ al Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ op@@ h S@@ ch@@ ö@@ n@@ bor@@ n , in which it will be confirmed how the Ch@@ ur@@ ch will help .
The as@@ y@@ l@@ um coordinator has also got high expectations of the OR@@ F " Help the way we are " campaign .
Private in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als can offer simple ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation over this platform .
It is also hoped that this will include h@@ o@@ tel@@ s , which are often em@@ p@@ ty in winter .
K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d and Ma@@ ier yesterday c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ s@@ ised the spec@@ ific@@ ations for ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation as " too high . "
In times of need it should not be necessary for those p@@ ro@@ vi@@ ding ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation to have to comply with certain h@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ ts for towel r@@ a@@ il@@ s or si@@ z@@ es of sk@@ y@@ li@@ gh@@ ts .
" E@@ mer@@ gen@@ cy standards " should apply for a limited period .
K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d us@@ es his experience as j@@ u@@ st@@ ific@@ ation for why he , in con@@ tr@@ ast to the Ministry for the Interior , should be successful with the ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation .
I am an older man , and n@@ o@@ body re@@ a@@ di@@ ly t@@ ells un@@ tru@@ ths to my face
His most important weap@@ on is the power of per@@ su@@ a@@ si@@ on .
K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d and Ma@@ ier are not co@@ st@@ ing the Re@@ public anything , as they themselves explain .
The want to raise the number of their staff from three to four .
Their own search for ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation has not yet been successful .
K@@ on@@ r@@ a@@ d wanted to set up a con@@ ta@@ in@@ er on S@@ te@@ ph@@ an@@ sp@@ lat@@ z as an office .
But a@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly there are problems with ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ing approval .
Lin@@ z de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ing a better allocation
For the time being the city of Lin@@ z is not planning to open new sp@@ or@@ ts halls and other buildings such as the T@@ i@@ ps Ar@@ ena or the Design C@@ ent@@ re as ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation for re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
At the moment this should not be ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ s@@ ar@@ y , as the people in question can currently be ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor K@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ s L@@ u@@ ger ( S@@ P ) .
But in case of emergency further locations need to be checked for their su@@ it@@ ability .
The town chief is c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ ing the allocation of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es within the federal states .
Other di@@ stri@@ c@@ ts should also make their own con@@ tri@@ b@@ u@@ tions .
S@@ e@@ e@@ h@@ o@@ fer : " B@@ or@@ der@@ s will not be c@@ or@@ d@@ on@@ ed off "
In a long tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one call with B@@ av@@ ar@@ ian Prime Minister H@@ or@@ s@@ t S@@ e@@ e@@ h@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , State Go@@ v@@ er@@ n@@ or J@@ o@@ se@@ f P@@ ü@@ h@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ er ( V@@ P ) on Monday agreed to further action on the issue of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
S@@ e@@ e@@ h@@ o@@ fer has as@@ su@@ red me that the German bor@@ der@@ s will not be c@@ or@@ d@@ on@@ ed off .
The on@@ ward journey of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es into the Federal Re@@ public continues to be possible .
However appro@@ pri@@ ate border controls do now exist .
There will now no longer be any special trains with re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ing to Germany .
Those seeking protection will however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
P@@ ü@@ h@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ er once more called for increased so@@ li@@ d@@ ar@@ ity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
The fact that Au@@ stri@@ a is also now re@@ in@@ tro@@ du@@ c@@ ing controls at its bor@@ der@@ s is for P@@ ü@@ h@@ r@@ in@@ g@@ er " a lo@@ g@@ ical con@@ sequ@@ ence " of Germany 's approach .
The next Run@@ ta@@ st@@ ic is only a matter of time
The general renovation of the " Ne@@ u@@ en W@@ er@@ f@@ t " in the Lin@@ tz in@@ du@@ stri@@ al area is officially finished .
The p@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ly li@@ sted IT group S & T has mo@@ v@@ ed into four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing building . It is planned that the rest ( 27@@ 00 m ² ) will be r@@ ent@@ ed to young , in@@ n@@ o@@ v@@ ative b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es in the technology sector .
" In IT c@@ le@@ ver heads are our r@@ a@@ w material - and we must try to get them to work for us , " says S & T bo@@ s@@ s H@@ ann@@ es N@@ i@@ e@@ der@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ er .
He can im@@ ag@@ ine investing in star@@ t@@ -@@ up b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es in Ne@@ u@@ en W@@ er@@ f@@ t , and also later ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing these .
S & T wants to c@@ ol@@ l@@ abor@@ ate with the new n@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ bo@@ ur@@ s from the start - and N@@ i@@ e@@ der@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ er promises : " The next Run@@ ta@@ st@@ ic is only a matter of time . "
S@@ M@@ T is investing € 1.@@ 7 million in the lo@@ c@@ ation and € 3@@ .@@ 3 million is coming from Te@@ ch@@ centre , a third of which b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ s to each of the town of Lin@@ tz , the state of Upper Au@@ stri@@ a and the federal government ( F@@ FG ) .
The building is le@@ ased by Lin@@ z A@@ G to S & T and Te@@ ch@@ centre for 60 years .
Th@@ ir@@ ty percent of the remaining 27@@ 00 m ² in the building is already r@@ ent@@ ed out and there have been en@@ qu@@ i@@ ries about the other 40 percent .
Ow@@ ner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni opens second business in the ar@@ c@@ a@@ de .
In the new shop the focus is on F@@ ur@@ la h@@ an@@ d@@ b@@ ags .
J@@ ut@@ t@@ a Bre@@ it actually wanted to get a dog .
The 49@@ -year-old p@@ ro@@ pri@@ e@@ t@@ or of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ b@@ en@@ m@@ ar@@ k@@ t ar@@ c@@ a@@ de had to un@@ c@@ er@@ em@@ on@@ i@@ ously post@@ p@@ one this plan : now she has finally expanded by taking on new pre@@ mis@@ es
In the F@@ ur@@ la shop opposite the business where she s@@ ells among other things b@@ ags , cases , shoes and g@@ ar@@ ments from different man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ ers , everything now re@@ v@@ ol@@ ves around F@@ ur@@ la women 's h@@ an@@ d@@ b@@ ags ; p@@ ur@@ s@@ es can be ob@@ ta@@ in@@ ed starting at € 75 .
Lar@@ ger b@@ ags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
The new shop opened yesterday .
It has been con@@ v@@ er@@ ted over the last few weeks .
" I have been con@@ si@@ der@@ ing for a long time whether I should open another shop , " says Bre@@ it .
C@@ ru@@ c@@ i@@ al for this decision was among other things that the F@@ ur@@ la man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ ers , who are based in B@@ ol@@ o@@ gn@@ a , were impressed with the idea of their own lo@@ c@@ ation where only their h@@ an@@ d@@ b@@ ags are sold .
" We are the only people in the greater Lin@@ tz area who sell this brand , " said the mother of two d@@ a@@ u@@ gh@@ ters , who herself has Italian ro@@ o@@ ts .
Bre@@ it got her interest in fashion from her mother , when she was still in the c@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ le .
It su@@ its me best if something em@@ er@@ g@@ es and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
The expert can with ab@@ sol@@ ute c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into r@@ a@@ p@@ tu@@ res at the si@@ g@@ h@@ t of a beautiful h@@ an@@ d@@ bag .
Per@@ ha@@ ps it 's because a beautiful h@@ an@@ d@@ bag can enhance any out@@ fit .
The b@@ r@@ ag@@ g@@ art from K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t
The Pal@@ at@@ ine anc@@ e@@ st@@ ors of D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p came from a place whose in@@ hab@@ it@@ an@@ ts are known as b@@ r@@ ag@@ g@@ ar@@ ts .
This char@@ ac@@ ter@@ istic also con@@ ne@@ c@@ ts many with the b@@ illi@@ onaire who wants to become US president .
D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p ( 6@@ 9 ) is always the source of controversy .
W@@ h@@ e@@ th@@ er he is e@@ x@@ pre@@ s@@ sing x@@ en@@ op@@ h@@ o@@ b@@ ic opinions , being ru@@ de to journal@@ ists or revealing g@@ a@@ p@@ s in knowledge on crisis politics , the US presidential candidate c@@ re@@ at@@ es a stir in the election campaign .
And comes out of it well .
This is also something that happens in the Pal@@ at@@ ine town of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t , from where the property b@@ illi@@ onaire 's grandparents or@@ ig@@ in@@ ate .
The New Y@@ or@@ ker with the b@@ lo@@ w@@ -@@ d@@ r@@ y ha@@ ir@@ style is a conc@@ ep@@ t to many in the win@@ em@@ aking village on the wine rou@@ te .
Many in the village of 1,@@ 200 in@@ hab@@ it@@ an@@ ts are related to him .
His g@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ father came from K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t in the Pal@@ at@@ ine : D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p , here in election campaign mo@@ de .
S@@ im@@ one W@@ en@@ de@@ l , a re@@ si@@ dent of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t , has made a film about T@@ ru@@ m@@ p .
And what do the in@@ hab@@ it@@ an@@ ts of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world ?
" I think they find it rather e@@ x@@ c@@ it@@ ing , but also in the way of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t people they are not deeply impressed .
The native of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t has made an am@@ us@@ ing doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ar@@ y film about the place and its fam@@ ou@@ s off@@ sh@@ oo@@ ts , included in whom b@@ es@@ ides T@@ ru@@ m@@ p are also the H@@ ein@@ z k@@ e@@ t@@ ch@@ up family .
T@@ ru@@ m@@ p , who is not known for his mo@@ de@@ st@@ y , also gets a chance to speak in " K@@ ings of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t " ( 20@@ 14 ) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway , even had he lived in K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t .
He has not won over the people there .
There is in@@ de@@ ed a certain respect for his family 's a@@ ch@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ em@@ ent@@ s , but there also tends to be a view that T@@ ru@@ m@@ p " is a bit of a b@@ ig@@ m@@ ou@@ th , " says W@@ en@@ de@@ l .
C@@ o@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ dent@@ ally , K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t 's nickname in the region is , " D@@ ie B@@ r@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ m@@ a@@ ch@@ er , " a di@@ al@@ ec@@ t term which trans@@ l@@ at@@ es as " The B@@ r@@ ag@@ g@@ art , " she says .
T@@ ru@@ m@@ p comes from the village of the b@@ r@@ ag@@ g@@ ar@@ ts .
The story of the T@@ ru@@ mp@@ s ' success began in 18@@ 85 when the man who would become D@@ on@@ al@@ d T@@ ru@@ m@@ p 's g@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ father em@@ ig@@ r@@ ated and opened a sal@@ o@@ on for gold p@@ ro@@ spec@@ tors in the USA .
The foundation stone for his property business was his first pur@@ ch@@ as@@ e of land in New York .
But his grandparents ' li@@ ves were not free of tra@@ g@@ e@@ dy : their wish to return per@@ man@@ ent@@ ly to their home country c@@ ol@@ l@@ a@@ p@@ s@@ ed in the B@@ av@@ ar@@ ian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ ine then b@@ el@@ on@@ ged .
They would not let T@@ ru@@ m@@ p enter as he had or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally left without a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ i@@ s@@ ation , the Di@@ rec@@ tor of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate History and Cul@@ tur@@ al An@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ y , Roland Paul , explains at the beginning of the film .
T@@ ru@@ m@@ p is the grandson of " illegal em@@ ig@@ r@@ an@@ ts . "
This is at odds with the sometimes p@@ i@@ th@@ y statements of his des@@ c@@ en@@ d@@ ant .
He has repeatedly sp@@ o@@ ken in der@@ o@@ g@@ at@@ or@@ y terms about M@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ c@@ an immigrants in the US , and de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ed the building of a border w@@ all in order to de@@ ter illegal immigrants .
" The f@@ us@@ s he makes about it is not very nice , " says H@@ an@@ s@@ -@@ J@@ o@@ a@@ ch@@ im B@@ en@@ der , a di@@ st@@ ant rel@@ ative of T@@ ru@@ m@@ p ( " My g@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ mother was bor@@ n a T@@ ru@@ m@@ p , my g@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ father was bor@@ n a H@@ ein@@ z " ) .
The re@@ ti@@ red win@@ em@@ ak@@ er se@@ es the American as rather al@@ o@@ of , " he always has a short f@@ use . "
Do@@ es he think T@@ ru@@ m@@ p will come ?
" I can 't im@@ ag@@ ine it , " says the 7@@ 2@@ -year-old .
" He has never had any interest in K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t . "
G@@ u@@ est h@@ ou@@ se l@@ an@@ d@@ l@@ ad@@ y V@@ er@@ on@@ i@@ k@@ a S@@ ch@@ ram@@ m , like many of K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ t 's in@@ hab@@ it@@ an@@ ts , men@@ tions that des@@ c@@ en@@ d@@ an@@ ts of the H@@ ein@@ z family made a don@@ ation towards the ch@@ ur@@ ch organ when they v@@ i@@ s@@ it@@ ed , which was very well received .
" I can 't im@@ ag@@ ine D@@ on@@ al@@ d doing that , " says the 68@@ -year-old .
She would pre@@ fer it if he doesn 't win the election as " he has such r@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ al opinions , I don 't know whether it would be a good thing . "
If anyone like him had been in charge in his g@@ r@@ an@@ d@@ father 's time , " he would never have gone there . "
" There are more inter@@ e@@ st@@ ing t@@ op@@ ics than him , " says win@@ em@@ ak@@ er 's daughter S@@ ar@@ ah B@@ ü@@ h@@ ler .
And as president ?
" He 's certainly not my president , " she says .
And , " the g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ es will ri@@ p@@ en without President T@@ ru@@ m@@ p . "
W@@ en@@ de@@ l 's film , for which T@@ ru@@ m@@ p gave a l@@ eng@@ th@@ y interview , has been seen by 12,000 c@@ in@@ em@@ a@@ -@@ go@@ ers , and interest is also growing in the USA .

The woman who Sam W@@ ood ends up with on The B@@ a@@ ch@@ el@@ or has been s@@ w@@ athed in ut@@ most se@@ c@@ rec@@ y .
And the three girls left standing certainly aren 't le@@ t@@ ting sli@@ p whether they are the one who received his final rose .
But when we checked in with S@@ ar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ sk@@ i and L@@ ana J@@ e@@ av@@ on@@ s@@ -@@ F@@ el@@ lo@@ w@@ s the day before three become two , they may have in@@ ad@@ v@@ er@@ t@@ ent@@ ly given away a c@@ lu@@ e as to who the win@@ ner will be .
Sam W@@ ood is keeping his li@@ ps f@@ ir@@ m@@ ly sealed until Thursday 's fin@@ al@@ e
All three women wa@@ x@@ ed l@@ y@@ ri@@ cal over why W@@ ood is the per@@ f@@ ec@@ t man , citing his sense of h@@ um@@ our , ambition , family v@@ al@@ ues and po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ ity as re@@ as@@ on@@ s they would each love to be his par@@ t@@ ner .
However when asked the question , " If not you , who should get W@@ ood 's final rose ? , " their answers could have provided a sp@@ o@@ iler as to who won the B@@ a@@ ch@@ el@@ ors h@@ e@@ art .
Both J@@ e@@ av@@ on@@ s@@ -@@ F@@ el@@ lo@@ w@@ s and Mark@@ o@@ sk@@ i were quick to name M@@ ack@@ ay as , a@@ p@@ art from themselves , the best match for W@@ ood .
S@@ ar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam W@@ ood have shared an easy r@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ or@@ t since day one .
" From the moment I walked into the h@@ ou@@ se , reading ( S@@ ar@@ ah 's ) energy and Sam 's energy I felt like they were quite com@@ p@@ at@@ i@@ ble and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show , " said J@@ e@@ av@@ on@@ s@@ -@@ F@@ el@@ lo@@ w@@ s .
" S@@ ar@@ ah is really down to e@@ ar@@ th , she 's so much fun to be around , " added Mark@@ o@@ sk@@ i .
I 've seen them together and they do have that ch@@ em@@ i@@ st@@ ry there .
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other .
S@@ ar@@ ah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam W@@ ood would be well su@@ it@@ ed as a couple .
For her part , M@@ ack@@ ay said last week 's home visit dates made her real@@ ise W@@ ood could be " the one . "
" Once I saw him with my friends and family I re@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed this ob@@ vi@@ ously isn 't just a game - I 'm w@@ h@@ ol@@ e@@ h@@ e@@ ar@@ te@@ d@@ ly invested in him now , " she said .
And asked who W@@ ood should choose if not her , she was en@@ ig@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c .

J@@ ar@@ r@@ y@@ d H@@ ay@@ n@@ e had several op@@ tions of where to begin his NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making in@@ qu@@ i@@ ries after his impressive open training day late last year .
But H@@ ay@@ n@@ e chose the San Franc@@ i@@ s@@ co 49@@ ers and coach Jim T@@ o@@ m@@ su@@ la and it 's looking like a w@@ ise decision .
Some co@@ a@@ ch@@ es would have b@@ en@@ ched H@@ ay@@ n@@ e for the rest of the game for lo@@ s@@ ing a f@@ um@@ ble like the A@@ us@@ sie ru@@ g@@ by league con@@ v@@ er@@ t did on his first pun@@ t return in Tuesday 's 20-@@ 3 win against Minnesota .
But T@@ o@@ m@@ su@@ la showed f@@ a@@ it@@ h in his man , giving H@@ ay@@ n@@ e the next opportunity to return a pun@@ t and including him in the running game after an injury to Reg@@ g@@ ie Bush .
T@@ o@@ m@@ su@@ la con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed to show his tru@@ e col@@ ours in the lo@@ ck@@ er room after the game .
In@@ st@@ e@@ ad of ch@@ e@@ wing out his ro@@ o@@ k@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he en@@ cour@@ ag@@ ed them .

It was certainly not the start H@@ ay@@ n@@ e and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut .

" Of course the subject of as@@ y@@ l@@ um is the main issue at the conc@@ la@@ v@@ e , " says A@@ i@@ w@@ an@@ ger .
A@@ i@@ w@@ an@@ ger is de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ing the establishment of a U@@ N safety zone in Syria , similar to the one during the Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ la@@ vi@@ an war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
" It can 't go on like this , we have to get to the c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ es , " says the Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler head .
The Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler want to de@@ p@@ or@@ t failed as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers as quickly as possible .
For this reason , A@@ i@@ w@@ an@@ ger also wants more personnel for the ad@@ m@@ in@@ str@@ ative courts , which are responsible for as@@ y@@ l@@ um cases : " We need at least 50 new as@@ y@@ l@@ um j@@ ud@@ g@@ es as well , " says A@@ i@@ w@@ an@@ ger .
The F@@ W head c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ised the lack of con@@ si@@ st@@ en@@ cy between several federal states : " We need uni@@ fied standards in the Federal states nationwide . "
" B@@ av@@ ar@@ ia de@@ p@@ or@@ ts ; others don 't . "
" We must be more eff@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ent . "

But that is not enough for A@@ i@@ w@@ an@@ ger .
" The G@@ 9 issue must be sp@@ e@@ e@@ ded up , " says the F@@ W head .
We demand freedom of choice for all g@@ r@@ am@@ m@@ ar schools that want it .
A free move to G@@ 9 e@@ very@@ where it is wanted .

4 K@@ ill@@ ed After Police Fire R@@ u@@ b@@ b@@ er Bul@@ lets at Pro@@ te@@ st@@ ers in Ne@@ p@@ al
Four people , including a 4@@ -year-old boy , were killed in southern Ne@@ p@@ al after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd de@@ m@@ on@@ str@@ ating against the country 's proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
The viol@@ ence occurred Tuesday evening in the di@@ stri@@ c@@ t of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of K@@ a@@ th@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ u , the capital .
B@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ n@@ u P@@ r@@ as@@ ad Dha@@ k@@ al , the chief di@@ stri@@ c@@ t officer , said more than 1,000 p@@ ro@@ te@@ st@@ ers had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing st@@ on@@ es and fi@@ re@@ b@@ o@@ m@@ bs .
Mr. Dha@@ k@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before re@@ s@@ or@@ ting to rubber bullets .
T@@ w@@ enty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets , which are known to kill but are tra@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ally used as a l@@ es@@ s@@ -@@ lethal alternative , a@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly produced such a high death t@@ ol@@ l .
The c@@ lash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Ne@@ p@@ al 's southern pl@@ ain@@ s , where members of the Mad@@ h@@ es@@ i ethnic group say new p@@ ro@@ v@@ inc@@ es established under the proposed new constitution would di@@ lu@@ te their political influence .
There have also been protests in western Ne@@ p@@ al from ethnic Th@@ ar@@ us who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since Au@@ g .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to di@@ vi@@ de the country into p@@ ro@@ v@@ inc@@ es - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly con@@ ten@@ ti@@ ou@@ s issue in Ne@@ p@@ al , which has been c@@ ent@@ rally go@@ v@@ er@@ n@@ ed for c@@ ent@@ ur@@ ies .
Work on a new constitution has been un@@ der@@ way since 2008 , but law@@ m@@ ak@@ ers ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated the process after the dev@@ ast@@ ating earth@@ quake that killed thousands of people in April .
L@@ aw@@ m@@ ak@@ ers have been voting on cl@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ es in the dra@@ f@@ t constitution in K@@ a@@ th@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new char@@ ter could be en@@ acted by Sunday .

H@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ e project : facts are in the open
Plans for the h@@ o@@ li@@ day home development at the K@@ l@@ ein@@ es Me@@ er near E@@ m@@ d@@ en are taking shape .
Investors have presented their plans for the project to the public .
A number of residents are again conc@@ ern@@ ed - they are worried about the sale of their le@@ i@@ s@@ ure re@@ f@@ u@@ ge .
Plans have been ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ated , mul@@ led over , de@@ b@@ ated , and plo@@ t@@ ted behind closed do@@ ors for months .
Now the plans for a new h@@ o@@ li@@ day home development on the K@@ l@@ ein@@ es Me@@ er near E@@ m@@ d@@ en are in the open .
The interested party , the E@@ m@@ d@@ en company " Sy@@ st@@ em@@ -B@@ au , " presented their plans to the E@@ m@@ d@@ en Council development com@@ mit@@ tee for the first time on Monday evening .
O@@ ri@@ g@@ in@@ ally this point was scheduled as a part of the ag@@ en@@ d@@ a not open to the public .
Under pressure from c@@ r@@ it@@ ics of the project and from the F@@ D@@ P f@@ ac@@ ti@@ on , who had accused in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ors and the administration of se@@ c@@ re@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , R@@ al@@ f Be@@ h@@ r@@ ends of the Sy@@ st@@ em@@ -B@@ au management went on the off@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e . " We don 't yet have an answer for all the questions , " he said in front of the council members and more than 50 spectators .
But it is good to be able to counter all the rumours now .
The € 10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
Pictures and new details of the proposed hotel building provoked strong re@@ actions among owners of p@@ ro@@ per@@ ties at the lake who attended the meeting ,
Ro@@ b@@ er@@ to S@@ ch@@ ul@@ z , property owner and member of the board of the residents ' lobby group , Pro H@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ e , claims : " It 's going to be a huge development which lo@@ o@@ m@@ s over all the other buildings . "
Furthermore , like a number of other c@@ r@@ it@@ ics of the project , he is af@@ r@@ a@@ id that traffic will increase enormously due to the proposed size of the f@@ ac@@ ility . " We have to reck@@ on with whole b@@ us@@ lo@@ ads arriving , " said S@@ ch@@ ul@@ z .
However it is not yet clear what exactly is going to happen on the h@@ ec@@ t@@ are si@@ z@@ ed area of the former rest@@ a@@ u@@ rant .
No op@@ er@@ ator has yet been identified .
" First of all we have to present a co@@ her@@ ent conc@@ ep@@ t , " says R@@ al@@ f Be@@ h@@ r@@ ends .
Since this does not yet exist , con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction plans are still subject to v@@ ar@@ i@@ ation .

Rather than having an executive make the announcement , R@@ it@@ a M@@ as@@ oud , a G@@ oo@@ g@@ le employee who f@@ led Kabul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her per@@ s@@ on@@ al experience .
" Our journey involved many dark train and b@@ us ri@@ des , as well as h@@ ung@@ er , th@@ ir@@ s@@ t , cold and fear , " she wrote .

For m@@ il@@ d@@ ly ob@@ ese di@@ a@@ be@@ tic@@ s , weight loss surgery may be h@@ el@@ p@@ ful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for m@@ il@@ d@@ ly ob@@ ese people with t@@ y@@ p@@ e 2 diabetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
It 's still to early to say whether m@@ il@@ d@@ ly ob@@ ese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive n@@ on-@@ s@@ ur@@ g@@ ical tre@@ at@@ ments , however .
" The m@@ or@@ t@@ ality data take a long time to show up , " said Dr. Rob@@ in Black@@ stone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ A@@ M@@ A Sur@@ ger@@ y .
W@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t loss operations , or bar@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c surgery , use v@@ ar@@ ious methods to s@@ h@@ r@@ ink the size of the stomach .
They reduce h@@ ung@@ er and limit the body 's ability to ab@@ sor@@ b food .
Over the years , bar@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c s@@ ur@@ ger@@ ies have proved effective for tre@@ ating t@@ y@@ p@@ e 2 diabetes , but most st@@ u@@ dies were done in people who are m@@ or@@ b@@ id@@ ly ob@@ ese , with a body m@@ ass index ( B@@ M@@ I ) of 35 or above .
B@@ M@@ I , a measure of weight in rel@@ ation to h@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t , is considered n@@ or@@ m@@ al between 18@@ .@@ 5 and 2@@ 4.@@ 9 .
A B@@ M@@ I of 25 or higher in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ es that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a B@@ M@@ I over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
You can c@@ al@@ c@@ ul@@ ate your B@@ M@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a@@ .@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
For the new study , researchers from T@@ ai@@ w@@ an 's Min@@ -S@@ h@@ en@@ g General Hospital used data c@@ olle@@ c@@ ted since 2007 in a trial com@@ par@@ ing two kin@@ ds of bar@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c surgery - g@@ ast@@ ri@@ c b@@ y@@ p@@ ass and sle@@ e@@ v@@ e g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tomy - to medical tre@@ at@@ ments for t@@ y@@ p@@ e 2 diabetes in people who were m@@ il@@ d@@ ly ob@@ ese .
The average B@@ M@@ I among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 2@@ 4.@@ 5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
Me@@ an@@ while , the B@@ M@@ I among those receiving n@@ on-@@ s@@ ur@@ g@@ ical diabetes tre@@ at@@ ments stayed about the same at 2@@ 9 .
Among those who had surgery , diabetes re@@ sol@@ v@@ ed com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely in 36 percent and parti@@ ally in 28 percent .
In the m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ all@@ y-@@ treated group , by com@@ par@@ i@@ s@@ on , diabetes re@@ sol@@ v@@ ed com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely in only 1 percent and parti@@ ally in only about 2 percent .
In addition , control of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ y@@ c@@ er@@ i@@ des , and " bad " L@@ D@@ L ch@@ ol@@ e@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ l " was generally better in the s@@ ur@@ g@@ ical group , " the authors found .
The researchers also m@@ on@@ it@@ o@@ red patients ' blood levels of h@@ em@@ o@@ g@@ lo@@ b@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t blood su@@ gar levels over time .
H@@ em@@ o@@ g@@ lo@@ b@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After surgery , the average h@@ em@@ o@@ g@@ lo@@ b@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
But this better " gl@@ y@@ c@@ em@@ ic control " - as re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted by the improved h@@ em@@ o@@ g@@ lo@@ b@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the m@@ or@@ t@@ ality rate at five years , according to lead re@@ sear@@ cher Dr. Ch@@ i@@ h@@ -@@ Ch@@ en@@ g H@@ s@@ u and colleagues .
The research team also compared average out@@ comes with the two types of surgery .
At the fifth year , compared to the sle@@ e@@ v@@ e g@@ ast@@ rec@@ tomy group , the b@@ y@@ p@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18@@ .@@ 7 v@@ s 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 2 k@@ g ) , achieved larger drops in B@@ M@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 v@@ s 5.@@ 1 ) and in h@@ em@@ o@@ g@@ lo@@ b@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3@@ .@@ 1 percent v@@ s 2.@@ 1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete diabetes re@@ mission ( 4@@ 6@@ .@@ 9 percent v@@ s 16@@ .@@ 7 percent ) .
While the new study does not show a s@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ al benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of h@@ e@@ a@@ vi@@ er people in S@@ w@@ e@@ d@@ en that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone , of the University of Arizona College of Me@@ di@@ c@@ in@@ e-@@ Phoenix .
In the S@@ w@@ e@@ di@@ s@@ h study , ob@@ ese people who had bar@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c surgery were about 2@@ 9 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more con@@ ven@@ tional methods .
Th@@ ou@@ gh the new study didn 't show a benefit in s@@ ur@@ vi@@ v@@ al among surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it 's re@@ as@@ s@@ uring for people with a B@@ M@@ I under 35 interested in the procedure .
" This is where this p@@ a@@ p@@ er is c@@ r@@ it@@ ical , because it says this surgery is sa@@ f@@ e in that lower B@@ M@@ I group , " with no increased risk of death or ren@@ al disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doc@@ tors should start taking weight seriously once the p@@ at@@ i@@ ent 's B@@ M@@ I falls between 27 and 30 .
" I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , " she said .
I think that once they 've accumulated these gen@@ etic changes that hard@@ wi@@ red their bodies into obesity and diabetes , re@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ing that is really hard .

Europe could not host all re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es , the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis li@@ es in the M@@ id@@ d@@ le East .
The T@@ i@@ be@@ t@@ an Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ist leader has called for the ending viol@@ ence in the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es " home countries .
The D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama C@@ ent@@ re for Com@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ on in Oxford , which is dedicated to e@@ th@@ ics st@@ u@@ dies , at the beginning of his 10-@@ day visit to the U@@ K .
He claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of h@@ um@@ an@@ ity should be put before the interests of single n@@ ations or even con@@ t@@ in@@ ent@@ s .
He also stressed that , however ad@@ m@@ ir@@ able , the W@@ e@@ st@@ -@@ European countries " response to the refugee crisis is in@@ adequate to the situation .
" It it 's im@@ possible for everyone to come to Europe , " he said in his speech .
Although the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama p@@ r@@ a@@ ised Germany 's and Au@@ stri@@ a 's efforts in de@@ aling with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
" So taking care of several th@@ ou@@ s@@ and re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es is w@@ on@@ der@@ ful , but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , " he em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ z@@ ed .
Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
We have to reduce the use of force .
The use of force has never sol@@ v@@ ed these problems , " he added .
Ad@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ sing the issue of viol@@ ence , the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama also commented on George Bush 's actions following 9 / 11 terrorist att@@ ac@@ ks , c@@ la@@ im@@ ing that the US " violent response en@@ gen@@ der@@ ed a chain of un@@ con@@ tro@@ l@@ l@@ able events .
After 9 / 11 I expressed my con@@ d@@ ol@@ en@@ ces in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to sol@@ v@@ e this problem was through n@@ on-@@ viol@@ ence .
I know his mo@@ ti@@ ves were good but he used force and it created unexpected con@@ sequ@@ en@@ ces , " the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama said .

According to Dr. G@@ ay@@ l@@ or@@ d L@@ op@@ e@@ z , director of the Georgia Po@@ i@@ s@@ on Center , hand s@@ an@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ er in@@ g@@ e@@ st@@ ion cases in children under 12 that were reported to po@@ i@@ s@@ on control centers went up from 3@@ ,@@ 2@@ 6@@ 6 in 20@@ 10 to 16@@ ,@@ 1@@ 17 in 20@@ 14 .
" K@@ ids are getting into these products more fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly , and unfortunately , there 's a per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of them going to the emergency room , " L@@ op@@ e@@ z told C@@ N@@ N .

Y@@ o@@ ung@@ er children can be drawn to attractive s@@ an@@ it@@ i@@ z@@ er sc@@ ent@@ s .
" A kid is not thinking this is bad for them , " L@@ op@@ e@@ z said .
A lot of the more attractive ( hand s@@ an@@ it@@ i@@ zers ) are the on@@ es that are sc@@ ent@@ ed .
There are stra@@ w@@ b@@ er@@ ry , g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ e , or@@ an@@ g@@ e@@ -@@ f@@ la@@ vo@@ red hand s@@ an@@ it@@ i@@ zers that are very a@@ p@@ pe@@ aling to k@@ ids .

In young children , especially , only a few s@@ qu@@ ir@@ ts can cause alcohol po@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ ing .
" It 's highly con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ated alcohol , " Dr. Stephen Th@@ or@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ i@@ s@@ on control center at University of Kansas Hospital , told Fox 4 in Kansas City .
So you w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't leave a shot of w@@ h@@ i@@ s@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand s@@ an@@ it@@ i@@ zers out and if k@@ ids get into it , it 's a quick way to con@@ su@@ me a lot of alcohol .

G@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ ths plays down di@@ sh@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ y talk
It has sp@@ ar@@ k@@ ed rumours of di@@ sh@@ ar@@ m@@ on@@ y at C@@ el@@ tic , which was dismissed out of hand by G@@ ri@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ ths , who insisted he and his te@@ am@@ -@@ mates are not l@@ abo@@ uring under any sense of increased sc@@ r@@ ut@@ in@@ y as they pre@@ p@@ are to face the D@@ ut@@ ch League leaders .
I don 't think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
L@@ ac@@ k of S@@ co@@ ts title race bo@@ res D@@ ut@@ ch - de Bo@@ er
Former R@@ ang@@ ers mid@@ fielder and e@@ x@@ -@@ Ne@@ th@@ er@@ lands international R@@ on@@ al@@ d de Bo@@ er has said that D@@ ut@@ ch football fans have lost interest in C@@ el@@ tic - because there 's no title rivalry with R@@ ang@@ ers .
De Bo@@ er , currently an am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for A@@ j@@ a@@ x , said : " In H@@ ol@@ l@@ and , they don 't show highlights of the C@@ el@@ tic games any more and why ? "
It is because R@@ ang@@ ers aren 't there .
People here don 't only talk about R@@ ang@@ ers coming back .
They talk about the O@@ l@@ d Firm .
They talk about both teams together and that 's what they are interested in .
There is a lot of tension in the O@@ l@@ d Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I 'll turn things around , v@@ ows De@@ il@@ a
R@@ ON@@ N@@ Y De@@ il@@ a has accepted C@@ el@@ tic are struggling , but the Nor@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ an bo@@ s@@ s vowed to turn things around .
De@@ fe@@ at to Mal@@ m@@ o and sub@@ sequ@@ ent Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League e@@ x@@ it was s@@ wi@@ ft@@ ly fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed by lo@@ s@@ ing to 10-@@ man A@@ b@@ er@@ de@@ en , who now sit five points clear at the top of the table .
But De@@ il@@ a said : " C@@ el@@ tic have had bad periods before and we will come again . "
Now we want to come out of it as quickly as possible .
I know it is very f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very an@@ g@@ r@@ y or sad about what is happening .
That is the same as we are - but we have to go on .
We really , really need the support of C@@ el@@ tic because that makes the players much better .
To stay together now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton war@@ y of January transfers
Despite comments just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he had identified some January transfer targets , R@@ ang@@ ers bo@@ s@@ s Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is war@@ y of a signing spree , in@@ si@@ st@@ ing he doesn 't want to di@@ s@@ ru@@ p@@ t the I@@ bro@@ x s@@ qu@@ ad 's un@@ ity .
The e@@ x@@ -@@ B@@ r@@ ent@@ f@@ or@@ d g@@ aff@@ er said : " The January transfer win@@ do@@ w is very different from the su@@ m@@ m@@ er win@@ do@@ w . "
In terms of players coming in the su@@ m@@ m@@ er , you have that pre@@ -@@ season period to bed them in , which you 've seen with our own group this season .
The s@@ qu@@ ad is doing really well .
Sometimes more harm is done by adding un@@ necessary players to what you really need .
C@@ el@@ tic target M@@ ich@@ u in retirement h@@ in@@ t
S@@ w@@ an@@ sea striker M@@ ich@@ u , linked with C@@ el@@ tic during the transfer win@@ do@@ w , has dropped h@@ in@@ ts that he could re@@ ti@@ re when his contract with the S@@ w@@ ans is up .
The 29@@ -year-old has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed with a troub@@ les@@ o@@ m@@ e an@@ k@@ le for two years , and failed to find a move away from Wales in the su@@ m@@ m@@ er .

Scotland 's un@@ em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was above the U@@ K 's rate of 5.@@ 5 per cent , the Office for National St@@ at@@ i@@ st@@ ics ( ON@@ S ) figures showed .

The em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment rate for Scotland fell over the quarter at 7@@ 4.@@ 0 per cent - a figure above the U@@ K average of 7@@ 3@@ .@@ 5 per cent .
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ el@@ l , com@@ m@@ ent@@ ing on the latest figures , said : " The government 's long term plan has la@@ id the fo@@ und@@ ations for a str@@ on@@ ger economy . "
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the U@@ K .

W@@ h@@ y I 'm A W@@ it@@ n@@ ess At An Ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ti@@ on In Oklahoma
L@@ ater today , bar@@ ring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
If it happens , and I hope it won 't , I will sit in a vie@@ wing g@@ all@@ er@@ y in the death ch@@ am@@ b@@ er at Oklahoma State P@@ en@@ it@@ en@@ ti@@ ar@@ y as R@@ ich@@ ar@@ d G@@ lo@@ s@@ si@@ p is executed by lethal injection .
He has asked me to be one of four official w@@ it@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ es to his death .
The in@@ v@@ itation was first made back in January , vi@@ a his best friend , and though I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day appro@@ a@@ ch@@ es , I 've come to d@@ re@@ ad it .
So why do it ?
I agreed because I th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t it was a good way of telling the full story about the death p@@ en@@ al@@ ty .
It would offer a uni@@ que perspective .
True , journal@@ ists are per@@ mit@@ ted to watch e@@ x@@ ec@@ u@@ tions in America and because there are often more applications than se@@ ats available , a m@@ ac@@ ab@@ re lo@@ t@@ ter@@ y takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media se@@ ats from 12 to five .
W@@ h@@ o@@ ever is p@@ i@@ c@@ ked will watch it disp@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ ately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting al@@ on@@ g@@ side R@@ ich@@ ar@@ d G@@ lo@@ s@@ si@@ p 's closest friends , and I have developed my own rel@@ ation@@ ship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two-@@ and-@@ a@@ -@@ half hours .
I like the guy .
We often l@@ a@@ u@@ gh a lot when we talk .
The p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on authorities say I cannot be both a w@@ it@@ n@@ ess and a journalist , so I won 't be allowed a n@@ o@@ te@@ book and p@@ en to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on T@@ w@@ it@@ ter of com@@ p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ing my im@@ parti@@ ality .
Here 's the lesson .
T@@ el@@ l the in@@ mate 's story the way he likes it , get access .
I complained to her .
She ad@@ mit@@ ted that she " could have p@@ h@@ r@@ ased it better , " but still th@@ in@@ ks I 'm w@@ r@@ ong to do what I 'm doing .
R@@ ich@@ ar@@ d G@@ lo@@ s@@ si@@ p has taken issue with some of the things I 've said and w@@ r@@ it@@ ten .
He doesn 't tell me what to write , and I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't do it even if he did .
I 've told him he can re@@ move me from his list of w@@ it@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ es at any time .
But he wants an international re@@ p@@ or@@ ter to be there to write about it .
If he dies , he th@@ in@@ ks the p@@ u@@ b@@ li@@ city will help the anti-@@ death p@@ en@@ al@@ ty movement .
Kim B@@ ell@@ w@@ are , a re@@ p@@ or@@ ter from the Huff@@ in@@ g@@ ton Post , will be al@@ on@@ g@@ side me .
If you want to know more about the case , p@@ le@@ as@@ e listen to the series of po@@ d@@ c@@ ast@@ s I 've made .
I won 't go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty that R@@ ich@@ ar@@ d G@@ lo@@ s@@ si@@ p is in@@ n@@ o@@ cent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van T@@ re@@ ese would make him guilty of being an ac@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ or@@ y after the fact .
But I believe there is a strong p@@ ro@@ b@@ ability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to j@@ u@@ st@@ i@@ f@@ y a death sentence .
I believe his execution is w@@ r@@ ong .
And it 's from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
What you will get from me is what it 's like to watch a man I like die an un@@ necessary death .
Man co@@ a@@ x@@ ed from C@@ ann@@ ing Ri@@ ver after so@@ g@@ g@@ y police ch@@ as@@ e
The C@@ ann@@ ing Vale con@@ st@@ able remained d@@ r@@ y as he co@@ a@@ x@@ ed the man from the C@@ ann@@ ing Ri@@ ver .
A Perth man 's bid to lose a police ta@@ il came und@@ one after he found himself in sh@@ al@@ low , m@@ u@@ d@@ dy water just m@@ e@@ t@@ res from a police officer trying to " co@@ a@@ x him g@@ ent@@ ly back to sh@@ or@@ e . "
C@@ ann@@ ing Vale police were called to a tre@@ sp@@ as@@ s@@ ing incident in B@@ ec@@ ken@@ ham on Tuesday .
When they spotted the suspect he tried to d@@ it@@ ch them by heading into the C@@ ann@@ ing Ri@@ ver .
But he didn 't get too far .
" He was standing in the water saying ' I 'm not getting out , ' come and get me ' , " Senior Ser@@ g@@ e@@ ant S@@ h@@ an@@ d@@ el@@ l C@@ ast@@ le@@ d@@ ine said .
Con@@ st@@ able L@@ a@@ ch@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c wasn 't too keen on getting his uni@@ form w@@ e@@ t , so he employed a sa@@ fer t@@ ac@@ tic - " good police ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ation . "
" Sometimes people do f@@ un@@ n@@ y things to try and es@@ c@@ a@@ p@@ e , " Senior Ser@@ g@@ e@@ ant C@@ ast@@ le@@ d@@ ine said .
Ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion f@@ oo@@ t@@ ball@@ er Ben C@@ ou@@ s@@ ins provides a m@@ em@@ or@@ able example .
In 2006 , C@@ ou@@ s@@ ins d@@ it@@ ched his car to avo@@ id a b@@ oo@@ ze b@@ us and attempted to swim across the S@@ w@@ an Ri@@ ver .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy al@@ le@@ g@@ es st@@ e@@ war@@ ds tried to sp@@ y on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy has alleged R@@ acing V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ ia st@@ e@@ war@@ ds attempted to plant a sp@@ y in his stab@@ l@@ es last year and threatened to quit racing immediately .
He took a@@ im at st@@ e@@ war@@ ds and R@@ acing V@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ ia 's in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ity department , alleging they have a per@@ s@@ on@@ al campaign against him with the late sc@@ r@@ at@@ ching of Lady T@@ at@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final stra@@ w on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ f@@ a@@ x Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to L@@ id@@ ari 's po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ v@@ e s@@ w@@ ab to co@@ b@@ al@@ t , which he can not explain .
He had bit@@ ten his t@@ ongue about the sp@@ y al@@ le@@ g@@ ations for 18 months and didn 't want it " to look like s@@ our g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ es . "
" I wasn 't going to say anything about that and I have s@@ at on it for a long time but sometimes you get so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated it all comes out at once , " M@@ oo@@ dy said .
They know it went on .
Sometimes you re@@ act and have to live the con@@ sequ@@ en@@ ces and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home t@@ on@@ ig@@ h@@ t and sle@@ ep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
When they start to think I 'm not that 's when I sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't be a tra@@ in@@ er .
I would then have to consider what I do with my lic@@ ence .
Earlier , M@@ oo@@ dy had dropped the b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ sh@@ el@@ l in a r@@ ac@@ in@@ g@@ .com interview that the in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ity department had tried to sp@@ y on his st@@ able .
" E@@ ig@@ h@@ te@@ en months ago T@@ er@@ ry B@@ a@@ il@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and D@@ r Brian S@@ te@@ war@@ t s@@ at in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment to work in my stab@@ l@@ es to offer information on what I was doing within my stab@@ l@@ es , " M@@ oo@@ dy said on R@@ ac@@ in@@ g@@ .com .
They ob@@ vi@@ ously believe I 'm a ch@@ e@@ at .
If that 's the case su@@ re@@ ly they should all hand in their b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ s because they 've been in@@ com@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ ent in trying to cat@@ ch me .
Robert R@@ oul@@ st@@ on , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and B@@ er@@ n@@ ar@@ d S@@ a@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aw@@ are of that at the time and are aw@@ are of that today .
Should that make me think it 's becoming per@@ s@@ on@@ al ?
Has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of ball@@ s and m@@ ay@@ be make people outside of tra@@ in@@ ers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
A@@ m I bad for the industry ?
A@@ m I that bad for the industry ?
M@@ ay@@ be people out there think I am .
M@@ ay@@ be they need to take my lic@@ ence off me and p@@ ush me away and I 've got no doubt what I 'm saying now might make them think about that .
But I 've got to the point now where I don 't care and that sa@@ d@@ den@@ s me .
That really sa@@ d@@ den@@ s me .
I will put the pressure on them and on@@ us on them to make a decision .
I 've got the support of my family and I can walk away .
The tra@@ in@@ er 's f@@ ru@@ stration levels have built with the long-@@ running co@@ b@@ al@@ t in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y involving L@@ id@@ ari and the late sc@@ r@@ at@@ ching had him saying that he could " throw my lic@@ ence across the table . "
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for pre@@ par@@ ing unbeaten ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion Black C@@ a@@ vi@@ ar , lab@@ elled the r@@ ac@@ e-@@ day treatment rule " ri@@ di@@ c@@ ul@@ ou@@ s " after a m@@ u@@ d or cl@@ ay p@@ oul@@ ti@@ ce had been app@@ li@@ ed to the h@@ or@@ s@@ es legs , which is against the r@@ ul@@ es .
It 's against the r@@ ul@@ es of racing .
I 've got to accept full re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility for that , " he said .
One of my staff m@@ i@@ st@@ ak@@ enly l@@ ac@@ ed m@@ u@@ d on its leg .
It could have had it last night .
It could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
It had it on race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a th@@ re@@ e-@@ month di@@ s@@ qu@@ al@@ i@@ fication for the race day treatment us@@ ing the p@@ oul@@ ti@@ ce , which st@@ e@@ war@@ ds have opened an in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into .
It is a jo@@ k@@ e .
People making these r@@ ul@@ es know nothing about the horse .
" We all understand that we need for r@@ ul@@ es but it has gone too far , " M@@ oo@@ dy said .

Mel@@ bo@@ ur@@ n@@ e Storm coach Craig B@@ ell@@ am@@ y hits back at ri@@ v@@ als over wrest@@ ling claims
Mel@@ bo@@ ur@@ n@@ e Storm coach Craig B@@ ell@@ am@@ y has called criticism of his side 's t@@ ac@@ k@@ l@@ ing as " ag@@ en@@ d@@ a se@@ t@@ ting " by the N@@ R@@ L 's two pre@@ m@@ i@@ er@@ ship f@@ a@@ vo@@ ur@@ it@@ es .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ st@@ ers coach Trent Robinson said the re@@ fer@@ e@@ es allowed the Storm to " wrest@@ le " his side during the Storm 's u@@ p@@ set win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
B@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ b@@ an@@ e B@@ r@@ on@@ co@@ s coach W@@ ay@@ n@@ e Bennett made a th@@ in@@ ly ve@@ il@@ ed reference to the Storm after his side 's qualifying final win over North Q@@ u@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a " show@@ case " of the ru@@ g@@ by league and said the two Q@@ u@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land weren 't " too big " into wrest@@ ling .
B@@ ell@@ am@@ y def@@ ended his side 's t@@ ac@@ k@@ l@@ ing and said they just focused on their " con@@ t@@ act " when t@@ ac@@ k@@ l@@ ing .
B@@ ell@@ am@@ y added he took confidence from having two leading co@@ a@@ ch@@ es c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ise his side as it meant they were conc@@ ern@@ ed about the Storm beating them .
" That ke@@ ep@@ s coming up - I didn 't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrest@@ ling when they beat us 2@@ 4@@ -@@ 2 , " B@@ ell@@ am@@ y said on Wednesday .
I can g@@ u@@ ar@@ an@@ tee we haven 't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or te@@ ch@@ n@@ i@@ qu@@ es , it 's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our con@@ t@@ act in t@@ ac@@ k@@ l@@ es and that has been the turn around for us .
Trent has been there three years and he ob@@ vi@@ ously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to lo@@ s@@ ing so it was a bit of a sh@@ o@@ ck to him .
It 's f@@ un@@ n@@ y how this always comes up at this time of year .
B@@ ell@@ am@@ y challenged Bennett 's idea of " e@@ x@@ c@@ it@@ ing football " re@@ m@@ in@@ ding his m@@ ent@@ or that Bennett 's St Ge@@ or@@ g@@ e@@ -@@ I@@ l@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dr@@ ag@@ on@@ s won the pre@@ m@@ i@@ er@@ ship in 20@@ 10 by playing " bor@@ ing " football .
W@@ ay@@ n@@ e is talking about e@@ x@@ c@@ it@@ ing f@@ oo@@ ty .
He made a point of com@@ par@@ ing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how e@@ x@@ c@@ it@@ ing their game was , " B@@ ell@@ am@@ y said .
I remember in 20@@ 10 St George was c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ised a lot for being a bor@@ ing team and W@@ ay@@ n@@ e said he didn 't give a r@@ at 's ar@@ se .
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as e@@ x@@ c@@ it@@ ing f@@ oo@@ ty , especially his young hal@@ ves with their speed .
That 's the f@@ oo@@ ty you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
He made that point in 20@@ 10 , now he wants everyone to play his style of f@@ oo@@ ty - not every team has two hal@@ ves like An@@ th@@ ony M@@ il@@ f@@ or@@ d and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like that .
To me it b@@ u@@ il@@ ds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit conc@@ ern@@ ed about playing us .
Six weeks ago they probably weren 't thinking of us when they get to the big games .
B@@ ell@@ am@@ y also po@@ in@@ ted out the Storm and R@@ oo@@ st@@ ers game was a higher sc@@ or@@ ing con@@ t@@ est than the B@@ r@@ on@@ co@@ s and Cowboys game .
The B@@ r@@ on@@ co@@ s game was probably a good game , I haven 't w@@ at@@ ched it yet but what was the score ? 16-@@ 12 ?
Our game it was 20-@@ 18 , there was two more tri@@ es in our game but is that e@@ x@@ c@@ it@@ ing f@@ oo@@ ty ?
Or is it making bre@@ ak@@ s and not sc@@ or@@ ing tri@@ es that is e@@ x@@ c@@ it@@ ing ?
To me it 's ag@@ en@@ d@@ as .
If they are men@@ ti@@ on@@ ing us it m@@ e@@ ans that at some stage we might meet them there .
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Q@@ u@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land Cowboys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sharks in next Saturday night 's preliminary final at A@@ A@@ M@@ I Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .

S@@ te@@ van H@@ o@@ g@@ g used girls phone to l@@ ure p@@ a@@ e@@ d@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
A p@@ a@@ e@@ d@@ op@@ h@@ ile used an 11@@ -year-old g@@ ir@@ l 's phone to so@@ lic@@ it child abuse images .
S@@ te@@ van H@@ o@@ g@@ g took the g@@ ir@@ l 's phone as she slept then lo@@ g@@ ged into an online mes@@ sag@@ ing service where he had a su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ on of in@@ de@@ cent images of children sent to him by another us@@ er .
The g@@ ir@@ l later w@@ o@@ k@@ e up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping H@@ o@@ g@@ g 's hand .
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately al@@ er@@ ting her mother .
Police attended and saw the five pictures , then an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ ed computers found at the address and discovered " conc@@ ern@@ ing " w@@ e@@ b sear@@ ches us@@ ing terms for finding in@@ de@@ cent image of children .
H@@ o@@ g@@ g then claimed to officers he had done it as it would " lead p@@ a@@ e@@ d@@ op@@ hil@@ es " on the inter@@ net before " pre@@ ten@@ ding he was a police officer to sc@@ are them . "
Fis@@ cal de@@ p@@ ute E@@ ili@@ dh Robertson told D@@ un@@ de@@ e Sheriff Court : " He said it was an ad@@ di@@ c@@ ti@@ on - that he was ad@@ di@@ c@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
He accepted the sear@@ ches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pre@@ tend to be a police officer to sc@@ are p@@ a@@ e@@ d@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
He was asked about his con@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ations with the un@@ k@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ n person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
He said he was doing it to l@@ ure them in .
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view r@@ a@@ p@@ e and murder images .
M@@ s Robertson added : " When the g@@ ir@@ l found the messages on the phone she sh@@ ou@@ ted her mother and was s@@ ha@@ king and cr@@ y@@ ing .
She saw the in@@ de@@ cent images on the phone and the accused was then con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ted .
The g@@ ir@@ l was inter@@ vie@@ wed and spoke of the accused us@@ ing the computer and P@@ l@@ ay@@ station to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .

More and more re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es are being p@@ i@@ c@@ ked up away from major control points on the G@@ er@@ man@@ -@@ Au@@ stri@@ an border .
D@@ ue to fear of discovery and people being arrested , many tra@@ f@@ f@@ ick@@ ers are leaving

St@@ ut@@ t@@ g@@ art : ta@@ il end of tropical storm " H@@ en@@ ry " expected in the s@@ ou@@ th west
Me@@ te@@ or@@ ologists are warning of s@@ qu@@ all@@ s in the s@@ ou@@ th west from Wednesday evening on@@ war@@ ds .
D@@ ue to a depression over western Europe at the moment , warm sea air is f@@ lo@@ w@@ ing into the country , the German Me@@ te@@ or@@ ological service ( D@@ W@@ D ) has ad@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ ed .
The powerful tro@@ u@@ gh is the ta@@ il end of tropical storm " H@@ en@@ ry , " which has mo@@ v@@ ed over the Atlantic from the B@@ er@@ m@@ u@@ d@@ a I@@ s@@ lands in the last few days .
V@@ i@@ ol@@ ent storms and th@@ un@@ der@@ storms are an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ated , particularly in B@@ a@@ d@@ en .
According to D@@ W@@ D , g@@ u@@ st@@ s of between 60 and 90 k@@ il@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res per hour can be an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ated on the S@@ w@@ ab@@ ian Mountains and in Bo@@ den@@ se@@ e@@ k@@ re@@ is .
On Friday the su@@ n is fo@@ rec@@ ast@@ ed to put in a longer appearance once again
The ch@@ as@@ si@@ s makes the di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence : every two years car man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ ers present their new mo@@ d@@ el@@ s at the I@@ A@@ A
In 20@@ 15 movement can be n@@ o@@ tic@@ ed in partic@@ ul@@ ar in com@@ p@@ act cars , which are selling especially well at the moment .
Com@@ p@@ act class cars are currently very much in demand : according to the Federal Office for Motor Tran@@ sport ( K@@ BA ) about 2@@ 8@@ .@@ 1 percent of new re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ations in August alone b@@ el@@ on@@ ged to this se@@ g@@ ment .
This is also re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ted at the I@@ A@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
In among all the f@@ ut@@ ur@@ istic conc@@ ep@@ t vehicles and the new high@@ -@@ end and lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y mo@@ d@@ el@@ s , this year above all it is new com@@ p@@ act mo@@ d@@ el@@ s which are being introduced .
One of the biggest pre@@ m@@ i@@ er@@ es for the German car sector here is the O@@ pe@@ l A@@ str@@ a , which hits the car de@@ al@@ er@@ ships in the a@@ u@@ t@@ um@@ n .
" The A@@ str@@ a is an extremely important model for us , " said O@@ pe@@ l bo@@ s@@ s K@@ ar@@ l@@ -@@ Thomas Ne@@ um@@ an@@ n at the show .
It is at the h@@ e@@ art of the brand .
To ensure that it s@@ ells well , the price of the new A@@ str@@ a is not increasing si@@ gn@@ ific@@ an@@ t@@ ly .
O@@ pe@@ l p@@ ro@@ po@@ s@@ es an ent@@ ry point below that of its main com@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ itor , the V@@ W G@@ ol@@ f , which starts at € 17@@ ,@@ 650 .
The latest A@@ str@@ a costs from € 16@@ ,@@ 9@@ 90 .
With a new 1.@@ 4 litre eng@@ ine , the A@@ str@@ a has an output of 74 k@@ w / 100 h@@ p .
The H@@ es@@ si@@ an man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er also offers di@@ es@@ el and p@@ e@@ t@@ ro@@ l eng@@ ines from 70 k@@ w / 95 h@@ p to 1@@ 4@@ 7 k@@ w / 200 h@@ p , including the first three c@@ y@@ l@@ in@@ der p@@ e@@ t@@ ro@@ l model .
Un@@ like its most important competitors , V@@ W G@@ ol@@ f and Ford F@@ o@@ c@@ us , for the first time the O@@ pe@@ l A@@ str@@ a is only available as a five do@@ or .
In sp@@ r@@ ing the e@@ st@@ ate car , already seen at the I@@ A@@ A , will follow as the second option
And what other com@@ p@@ act cars are being introduced al@@ on@@ g@@ side the A@@ str@@ a at the I@@ A@@ A ?
Ren@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t M@@ é@@ g@@ an@@ e : Ren@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t introduces the fourth generation of its com@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ itor to the A@@ str@@ a , the M@@ é@@ g@@ an@@ e , into the race .
The M@@ é@@ g@@ an@@ e can be seen at the show e@@ x@@ c@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ ely as a fi@@ v@@ e-@@ do@@ or , in a con@@ ven@@ tional and a di@@ st@@ inc@@ t@@ ly sp@@ or@@ ty version .
It will be available in de@@ al@@ er@@ ships at the beginning of next year , then also as an e@@ st@@ ate model .
In@@ fin@@ it@@ i : the In@@ fin@@ it@@ i Q@@ 30 is brand new in this se@@ g@@ ment .
The N@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ an off@@ shoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing se@@ g@@ ment with the new model .
The com@@ p@@ act In@@ fin@@ it@@ i , with its cur@@ v@@ ed lines , fits right into the des@@ ig@@ n line of the brand .
The b@@ a@@ si@@ c model will have a p@@ e@@ t@@ ro@@ l eng@@ ine with a performance of at least 90 k@@ w / 1@@ 2@@ 2 h@@ p .
A di@@ es@@ el with 80 k@@ w / 109 h@@ p or 1@@ 25 k@@ w / 17@@ 0 h@@ p is also on offer .
Su@@ z@@ u@@ ki B@@ al@@ en@@ o : also new in the se@@ g@@ ment is the Su@@ z@@ u@@ ki B@@ al@@ en@@ o , which c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ rates its world pre@@ m@@ i@@ er@@ e in F@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ f@@ urt .
On offer is the p@@ e@@ t@@ ro@@ l eng@@ ine model , including a newly developed 1.@@ 0 litre tur@@ b@@ o eng@@ ine and a performance of 8@@ 2 k@@ w / 1@@ 11 h@@ p .
According to the man@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er 's spec@@ ific@@ ations , the m@@ a@@ xim@@ um t@@ or@@ que is 17@@ 0 New@@ ton m@@ e@@ t@@ res ( N@@ m ) .
The B@@ al@@ en@@ o is launched in Europe in early 20@@ 16 .
D@@ S@@ 4 : not totally new , but com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely re@@ designed , is the D@@ S 4 com@@ p@@ act car model , which can be seen at the I@@ A@@ A .
The des@@ ign@@ ers at the cl@@ as@@ s@@ y Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n off@@ shoot have turned their hand primarily to the front end : here the r@@ a@@ di@@ ator g@@ r@@ ille has been newly designed and the modified head@@ li@@ gh@@ ts have been equipped with LE@@ D technology .
In the inter@@ i@@ or the in@@ fo@@ ta@@ in@@ ment system in partic@@ ul@@ ar has been mo@@ der@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ ed , the number of b@@ ut@@ t@@ on@@ s on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple 's Car@@ P@@ l@@ ay has been inc@@ or@@ p@@ or@@ ated .
In the com@@ p@@ act class the I@@ A@@ A also features a str@@ ing of re@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ ed and new versions such as the u@@ p@@ d@@ ated Mercedes A Class or the P@@ e@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ o@@ t 3@@ 0@@ 8 .
J@@ VA B@@ er@@ lin Te@@ g@@ e@@ l : fi@@ v@@ e-@@ s@@ qu@@ are@@ -@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ re c@@ ells are un@@ fit for human beings
The Federal Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional Court has upheld a com@@ pl@@ ain@@ t by a former in@@ mate of Te@@ g@@ e@@ l p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on that he had been housed for months in too small a c@@ el@@ l .
In p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le , p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ ers have a right to financial com@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ation for viol@@ ation to their human di@@ gn@@ ity if they are kept in c@@ ells which are too small .
The Federal Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional Court re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed this decision in a public r@@ ul@@ ing on Wednesday .
According to the judge , those affected can actually hope for money if they have been shut in too small a room for only a few days ( re@@ f : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 1@@ 2@@ 7 / 14 ) .
For this reason a former p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ er was successful with his con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional com@@ pl@@ ain@@ t in K@@ ar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he . He was detained in B@@ er@@ lin Te@@ g@@ e@@ l p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on between June and November 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 in a single c@@ el@@ l with a flo@@ or area of around five square m@@ e@@ t@@ res : the to@@ il@@ et was not in a separate room .
A@@ f@@ ter@@ war@@ ds the man , who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released , was trans@@ fer@@ red to a larger c@@ el@@ l .
His liability claim against the state of B@@ er@@ lin by reason of un@@ su@@ it@@ able p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on conditions however , failed .
But the con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional j@@ ud@@ g@@ es set aside the judgement of the Supreme Court in B@@ er@@ lin and re@@ sub@@ mit@@ ted the case there for renewed as@@ s@@ es@@ s@@ ment .
In their view the human di@@ gn@@ ity of the man had been viol@@ ated .
The Supreme Court is now de@@ c@@ i@@ ding the amount of the damages .
Even if for legal re@@ as@@ on@@ s only a few days of the period in custody are significant for com@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ation , ent@@ it@@ le@@ ment to a claim for com@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ation e@@ x@@ ists .
O@@ th@@ er@@ w@@ ise there would be " fears of de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ation of a person 's right to protection . "
The Supreme Court must now settle the amount of p@@ ec@@ uni@@ ar@@ y com@@ p@@ en@@ s@@ ation .
Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional j@@ ud@@ g@@ es have often strengthened the rights of p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ ers in the past .
As recently as April they awarded damages to a p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ er because he had been locked in his c@@ el@@ l n@@ aked .
A c@@ el@@ l with mul@@ ti@@ p@@ le f@@ un@@ c@@ tions and without a separate to@@ il@@ et is also in@@ h@@ um@@ ane , according to a decision from 20@@ 11 .
Furthermore K@@ ar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he confirmed on Wednesday that in addition , according to the B@@ er@@ lin Con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional Court , a p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ er in a par@@ al@@ le@@ l case in November 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 had at@@ tested to in@@ h@@ um@@ ane ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation
The p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ er at that time was kept in a similar c@@ el@@ l to that in the K@@ ar@@ l@@ s@@ ru@@ he case daily between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. for over three months
B@@ er@@ lin prisons have also hit the head@@ lines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff .
Because of this , p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on@@ ers are time and again locked up for 23 hours , ag@@ g@@ re@@ s@@ si@@ ven@@ ess r@@ i@@ s@@ es and it has even led to bra@@ w@@ ls due to the tense situation .
According to information from the press office of the public p@@ ro@@ se@@ c@@ ut@@ or , 21 po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ s in Te@@ g@@ e@@ l have not been filled due to a lack of young people , and 19 will ce@@ as@@ e to exist in 20@@ 16 .
An@@ g@@ el@@ a M@@ er@@ k@@ el and the refugee policy : " We can handle it "
The in@@ f@@ lu@@ x of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es is an enormous challenge - the German Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is de@@ ter@@ m@@ in@@ ed to accept it .
What changes will we see in Germany ?
According to the pre@@ di@@ c@@ tions of the Federal Minister of the Interior , around 800,000 as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers will arrive in Germany this year , and according to a statement by Vice Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Sig@@ m@@ ar G@@ ab@@ ri@@ el ( S@@ P@@ D ) , Germany is actually in a position to take in a million re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
German Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or An@@ g@@ el@@ a M@@ er@@ k@@ el ( C@@ D@@ U ) has de@@ m@@ on@@ str@@ ated determination in the face of this un@@ usual challenge . " I say again and again : we can handle it , and we will handle it . "
The following is a su@@ m@@ m@@ ar@@ y of what is coming to Germany .
According to v@@ ar@@ ious fo@@ rec@@ asts between 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 ( e@@ st@@ im@@ ation by the Ministry of buildings ) and 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 ( e@@ st@@ im@@ ation by the P@@ e@@ st@@ el Institute ) homes will be needed annually - and in fact for the next five years .
That is twice as many as are being built at the moment ( 250,000 homes ) .
The lack of living sp@@ ace is dramatic but above all for affordable r@@ ent@@ al p@@ ro@@ per@@ ties : between 6@@ 0,000 and 8@@ 0,000 social d@@ w@@ ell@@ ings per year are e@@ x@@ c@@ lu@@ ded from rent control and re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es will also compete for these particularly ch@@ e@@ a@@ p homes .
Federal building minister Barbara H@@ en@@ d@@ ri@@ cks ( S@@ P@@ D ) th@@ us wants to double f@@ un@@ ding from the current € 5@@ 18 million to € 1 billion .
In the view of the P@@ e@@ st@@ el Institute this is far too little : 8@@ 0,000 social d@@ w@@ ell@@ ings must be developed annually and for this the government must in@@ v@@ est a su@@ m of € 6@@ .@@ 4 billion per year .
A@@ c@@ a@@ de@@ m@@ ics and the Federal Bu@@ il@@ ding Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing .
According to e@@ st@@ im@@ at@@ es by the Institute for Emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment Research , it could be expected that in the long term 5@@ 5 percent of the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in Germany should be able to work .
However the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es in Germany are not being sy@@ st@@ em@@ at@@ i@@ c@@ ally asked about their qu@@ al@@ i@@ fic@@ ations so as to be able to help them get started , c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ ised C@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ dia Wal@@ ter , project manager for in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ation and training in the B@@ er@@ tel@@ s@@ man@@ n Foundation .
But it is crucial for the in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ation of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social con@@ t@@ act and to a@@ p@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ation of the host society , and also to the self-@@ e@@ st@@ e@@ e@@ m of the immigrant says migration re@@ sear@@ cher D@@ i@@ e@@ tri@@ ch T@@ h@@ r@@ ä@@ n@@ har@@ d@@ t .
According to T@@ h@@ r@@ ä@@ n@@ har@@ d@@ t , a political sh@@ i@@ f@@ t has taken place in Germany : from a ban on em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment for re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es to an a@@ p@@ pre@@ c@@ i@@ ation of work .
While in the past as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers were forbidden to work for up to five years , this was reduced in November 20@@ 14 to three months , as with the re@@ si@@ den@@ ce obligation which limits as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers to one place of d@@ o@@ m@@ i@@ c@@ ile .
As far as the majority of society is now conc@@ ern@@ ed , particularly in view of skills short@@ age , re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es should be allowed to gain faster access to the job market .
One big ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language .
To date there is still no adequate supply of general and work-@@ related language co@@ ur@@ s@@ es .
St@@ u@@ dies also show that jobs are most often found through per@@ s@@ on@@ al con@@ t@@ act .
Th@@ us , in T@@ h@@ r@@ ä@@ n@@ har@@ d@@ t 's view , the building of networks is the i@@ de@@ al solution to work in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ation .
The B@@ er@@ lin school administration has n@@ o@@ tic@@ ed that only a few refugee parents have plac@@ ed their children in kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten ; an estimated one to 15 percent . " For the u@@ p@@ ro@@ o@@ ted parents their first priority is to keep the family together , " says I@@ l@@ j@@ a Ko@@ s@@ ch@@ em@@ bar , spokesman for youth and family affairs in the B@@ er@@ lin Senate administration .
To be able to con@@ v@@ in@@ ce families of the benefits of kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ s , the administration is i@@ s@@ su@@ ing le@@ af@@ lets in a number of l@@ an@@ g@@ u@@ ag@@ es .
If the need for teachers increases sharply because of the large number of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es the B@@ er@@ lin Senate would try to raise the training capacity , for example by allowing for more te@@ ch@@ n@@ ical col@@ le@@ g@@ es .
In the states , p@@ u@@ p@@ il@@ s with no knowledge of German will be pre@@ p@@ a@@ red for l@@ es@@ s@@ on@@ s in w@@ el@@ coming cl@@ as@@ s@@ es .
However they will not always be taught by fully qu@@ al@@ i@@ fied teachers but , as in B@@ er@@ lin , also by teachers who only have a qu@@ al@@ i@@ fication in German as a second language .
There is no short@@ age of these , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the B@@ er@@ lin school administration .
The German student services estimate that around 20 percent of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es want to study in Germany .
In p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le no federal state p@@ ro@@ h@@ ib@@ its as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers or those with long-term refugee status from st@@ ud@@ y@@ ing - the only e@@ x@@ c@@ ep@@ ti@@ on up to now was B@@ er@@ lin : Sen@@ ator for the Interior Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( C@@ D@@ U ) has however now ab@@ an@@ d@@ on@@ ed his st@@ ance .
Re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es who want to study may have their entrance to un@@ i@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ity f@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ated .
Re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es with a re@@ si@@ den@@ ce permit or protection against de@@ port@@ ation no longer receive benefits according to the as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers benefits act if they begin a course of study .
In p@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ le the latter receive no grant , as they do not fall into the category of per@@ s@@ on@@ s ent@@ it@@ led to a grant .
T@@ ol@@ er@@ ated re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es up to now must have lived for years in Germany in order to be ent@@ it@@ led to a grant ; from 1 January 20@@ 16 this period is reduced to 15 months .
But this fin@@ anc@@ ing gap must also be closed , claim S@@ te@@ f@@ f@@ en K@@ r@@ a@@ ch , B@@ er@@ lin 's State Secretary for Science , and the German student services .
The students should receive a grant immediately .
I@@ s@@ l@@ am will play an important role in the future as the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their id@@ ent@@ ity .
The state should g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ ally grant I@@ s@@ l@@ am the same rights as the ch@@ ur@@ ches have and the e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ing st@@ at@@ e-@@ ch@@ ur@@ ch law should be developed into a st@@ at@@ e-@@ religion rel@@ ation@@ ship .
The fo@@ unding of an Islamic welfare or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation , which looks after new ar@@ ri@@ v@@ als in a professional man@@ ner , is also important .
Rights also involve re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ es .
Th@@ us the re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ at@@ i@@ ves of I@@ s@@ l@@ am must agree to clear points of con@@ t@@ act and be read@@ y to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate with the state in many areas and to conce@@ de certain control op@@ tions .
This also requires the readiness to act cour@@ age@@ ously against religious f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ alism .
The chairman of the Centr@@ al Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ z@@ ye@@ k , expressed the fear on Thursday that religious con@@ fli@@ c@@ t could also be brought to Germany .
Those who want to w@@ age such con@@ fli@@ c@@ t in Germany " have immediately f@@ or@@ f@@ e@@ it@@ ed their right to stay here in Germany , " he said on B@@ av@@ ar@@ ian r@@ a@@ di@@ o .
He suggested trans@@ lat@@ ing this b@@ a@@ si@@ c law into Arab@@ ic .
In the future in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ation will be a t@@ op@@ ic for the whole of society even more than it is today .
This m@@ e@@ ans too that mainstream society will have to change and the re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of discrimination and r@@ ac@@ ism is becoming more ur@@ g@@ ent .
For nearly 10 years , as a result of European r@@ ul@@ ings , Germany has had an anti-@@ discrimination agency and a general equality act .
But it is le@@ ar@@ n@@ ing very s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly , as the N@@ S@@ U murder series shows , that r@@ ac@@ ist mo@@ ti@@ ves are sy@@ st@@ em@@ at@@ i@@ c@@ ally ig@@ n@@ o@@ red in the police and the authorities .
E@@ qu@@ al op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es for all : what mig@@ rant or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ations and n@@ on-@@ white German pressure groups have de@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ed for a long time , and to which international tre@@ at@@ i@@ es such as the anti r@@ ac@@ ism con@@ ven@@ ti@@ on in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next 10 years if the country wants to remain at peace and to exploit the op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es of its new citizens - for the good of everyone .
Germany is in a position generally to provide medical care for the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es expected up to now , is the opinion of the president of the D@@ o@@ c@@ tors ' Association , Frank Ul@@ rich Mon@@ t@@ g@@ o@@ m@@ er@@ y .
" As far as man@@ power and capacity are conc@@ ern@@ ed , we can cop@@ e , " he told the T@@ ag@@ es@@ sp@@ i@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ l .
However e@@ x@@ tra money must be added to the system for this .
In order to avo@@ id bott@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ ks , Mon@@ t@@ g@@ o@@ m@@ er@@ y asked for all new ar@@ ri@@ v@@ als to be issued with healthcare cards when they re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ er .
Services provided can be ac@@ co@@ un@@ ted for with the Federal states later .
And in the long term it is highly dou@@ b@@ t@@ ful that so many people can be fo@@ b@@ bed off with the limited cat@@ alogue of services for which the Ben@@ e@@ f@@ its for A@@ sy@@ l@@ um S@@ e@@ e@@ k@@ ers Act provides .
A@@ part from this , doc@@ tors are making it their priority to deal with the language bar@@ ri@@ er .
U@@ p to now , as B@@ er@@ lin health re@@ sear@@ cher T@@ h@@ e@@ a B@@ or@@ de has established , mig@@ r@@ an@@ ts have received po@@ or@@ er information about their ill@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ es than other patients .

But many re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es would also already be helped with more general m@@ e@@ di@@ c@@ ine dro@@ p-@@ in c@@ ent@@ res in emergency rooms .
And with a different di@@ ag@@ n@@ o@@ st@@ ic view .
Re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e children for example clearly su@@ f@@ f@@ er from more un@@ treated di@@ s@@ ab@@ il@@ it@@ i@@ es , and with young people it is more a case of information about HI@@ V .
German doc@@ tors though are able to use their training to deal with the partly different disease p@@ at@@ ter@@ n@@ s , said Mon@@ t@@ g@@ o@@ m@@ er@@ y
" P@@ ar@@ as@@ it@@ e in@@ f@@ ections or tu@@ b@@ er@@ c@@ u@@ lo@@ sis are not that difficult to recognise . " And because of the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es there is possibly relief in si@@ g@@ h@@ t for the short@@ age of doc@@ tors .
Syria has a highly developed e@@ du@@ c@@ ational system and a number of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es are expected to be doc@@ tors .
To be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qu@@ al@@ i@@ fic@@ ations and possibly take more e@@ x@@ am@@ s .
In the e@@ st@@ im@@ ation of the Federal P@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ th@@ er@@ a@@ p@@ e@@ u@@ tic Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es arriving in Germany are m@@ ent@@ ally ill : most of them are su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ing from po@@ st@@ -@@ tr@@ a@@ u@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c stress di@@ s@@ order or depression .
Re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e children are particularly vulnerable , explains D@@ i@@ e@@ tri@@ ch M@@ un@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
A so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be published study by the T@@ U in M@@ un@@ i@@ ch documents that every fifth Sy@@ ri@@ an refugee child ar@@ ri@@ ves tr@@ a@@ u@@ m@@ at@@ ised in Germany .

Further sy@@ mp@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ s are sle@@ ep and con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ation disorders , ner@@ v@@ ou@@ s@@ n@@ ess and emo@@ tional n@@ um@@ b@@ n@@ ess .
In order to prevent the sy@@ mp@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ s becoming ch@@ ron@@ ic , early treatment is necessary , e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed M@@ un@@ z .
U@@ p to now , however , only four percent of m@@ ent@@ ally ill re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es have received p@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ therapy .
M@@ ent@@ ally ill as@@ y@@ l@@ um se@@ e@@ k@@ ers are per@@ mit@@ ted to make an app@@ lic@@ ation with the social security services for p@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ therapy , but p@@ ro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ing usually takes several months .
In addition , it is mostly officials or doc@@ tors in the social services who are not trained in psych@@ ological ill@@ n@@ es@@ s@@ es who decide whether therapy is necessary or not .

S@@ te@@ ph@@ an@@ ie Pro@@ b@@ s@@ t has her own answer to this : " If our animals aren 't happy , then nor are we . "
About 80 animals from five different con@@ t@@ in@@ ent@@ s enjoy every bit of attention .

We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
If the anim@@ al doesn 't feel well , it doesn 't want to go in the ring either .
So the top priority is to look after the animals well .

Zim@@ b@@ ab@@ we 's Robert Mu@@ g@@ ab@@ e deli@@ v@@ er@@ s w@@ r@@ ong speech in par@@ li@@ am@@ ent
Mr Mu@@ g@@ ab@@ e , Africa 's ol@@ dest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a po@@ di@@ um .
He was un@@ hurt , but video of the fall went v@@ ir@@ al on social media .
The opening of par@@ li@@ am@@ ent was also tar@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ed by claims by opposition le@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ lat@@ ors that they had received an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ou@@ s death th@@ re@@ ats warning them against b@@ oo@@ ing Mr Mu@@ g@@ ab@@ e during his address .
Last month , they b@@ oo@@ ed and h@@ ec@@ k@@ l@@ ed him during his state of the nation address in par@@ li@@ am@@ ent - which is the speech he re@@ pe@@ ated on Tuesday .
Mo@@ v@@ em@@ ent for Democratic Ch@@ an@@ ge ( M@@ D@@ C ) chief w@@ h@@ i@@ p In@@ n@@ o@@ cent G@@ on@@ ese said seven opposition p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans received te@@ x@@ t messages on their mobile ph@@ on@@ es warning them not to di@@ s@@ ru@@ p@@ t N@@ r Mu@@ g@@ ab@@ e 's address .
" The m@@ es@@ s@@ age is coming from a number which is not re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ ting but it 's tit@@ led ' death ' , " he told journal@@ ists after Mr Mu@@ g@@ ab@@ e 's speech .
It warns the members conc@@ ern@@ ed to know that im@@ m@@ un@@ ity ends at par@@ li@@ am@@ ent and once they step out of par@@ li@@ am@@ ent that parliamentary im@@ m@@ un@@ ity does not op@@ er@@ ate .

H@@ e@@ wle@@ tt@@ -P@@ ack@@ ar@@ d to cut up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ e@@ wle@@ tt@@ -P@@ ack@@ ar@@ d expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its re@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tur@@ ing and co@@ st@@ -@@ saving efforts at it ent@@ er@@ p@@ rise services business .
H@@ P is splitting into two li@@ sted companies later this year , se@@ par@@ ating its computer and p@@ r@@ in@@ ter b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es from its f@@ ast@@ er-@@ growing cor@@ p@@ or@@ ate hardware and services operations .
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7@@ b@@ n , beginning in the fourth quarter , H@@ P said in a statement .
" These re@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tur@@ ing activities will enable a more competitive , sustain@@ able cost structure for the new H@@ e@@ wle@@ t@@ t P@@ ack@@ ar@@ d En@@ ter@@ p@@ rise , " said Me@@ g W@@ h@@ it@@ man , the H@@ P chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the sp@@ lit .
" H@@ e@@ wle@@ t@@ t P@@ ack@@ ar@@ d En@@ ter@@ p@@ rise will be s@@ m@@ aller and more focused than H@@ P is today , and we will have a bro@@ ad and deep port@@ fo@@ li@@ o of b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es that will help enterprises trans@@ it@@ i@@ on to the new style of business , " said W@@ h@@ it@@ man .
As a separate company , we are better po@@ s@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ ed than ever to meet the e@@ v@@ ol@@ ving ne@@ e@@ ds of our customers around the world .
H@@ e@@ wle@@ t@@ t P@@ ack@@ ar@@ d En@@ ter@@ p@@ rise will have more than $ 50@@ b@@ n in annual revenue and " will be focused on deli@@ v@@ er@@ ing un@@ ri@@ v@@ al@@ ed in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ated technology solutions " to companies , according to a company statement .
It bre@@ ak@@ s up a company formed in the 1@@ 9@@ 3@@ 0@@ s by Stanford University g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ at@@ es Bill H@@ e@@ wle@@ t@@ t and Dave P@@ ack@@ ar@@ d to make electric equipment , and whose Pal@@ o Al@@ to g@@ ar@@ age has been dubbed " the b@@ ir@@ th@@ place of S@@ ili@@ c@@ on V@@ al@@ le@@ y .

H@@ P has been un@@ der@@ going a massive re@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation to cop@@ e with the move away from traditional per@@ s@@ on@@ al computers to mobile de@@ v@@ i@@ c@@ es .
The move by H@@ P , the world 's second-largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that ti@@ gh@@ t@@ ly focused firms perform better .
Arsenal c@@ a@@ p@@ ta@@ in M@@ i@@ k@@ el Ar@@ te@@ t@@ a says te@@ am@@ -@@ mates must get behind injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ er@@ e ahead of D@@ in@@ am@@ o Z@@ ag@@ re@@ b ti@@ e
W@@ en@@ ger has also stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ er@@ e that it is still only September and , p@@ ro@@ vi@@ ding his re@@ hab@@ il@@ itation go@@ es to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas .
That best-@@ case sc@@ en@@ ar@@ io already m@@ e@@ ans that Wil@@ sh@@ er@@ e is certain to mis@@ s at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next su@@ m@@ m@@ er 's European Championship is clearly un@@ certain .
The great sh@@ am@@ e of this latest problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ er@@ e had finished last season str@@ on@@ g@@ ly after a separate an@@ k@@ le injury and then looked back to his old sh@@ ar@@ p@@ n@@ ess during pre@@ -@@ season .
" This kind of injury is not c@@ are@@ er-@@ threatening , " said W@@ en@@ ger .
It is a bone that did not h@@ e@@ al well .
It is nothing major .
This was just an accident .
It was not linked with his an@@ k@@ l@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
That might be tru@@ e from a pu@@ re@@ ly medical perspective but , as W@@ en@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further injuries w@@ h@@ en@@ ever any player tri@@ es to return mid@@ season .
There is also an un@@ comfortable p@@ at@@ ter@@ n developing .
Research by Prem@@ ier In@@ j@@ ur@@ ies Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ er@@ e a@@ il@@ ments since he made his debut six years ago .
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal 's 15@@ 7 league games during the last five seasons .
The wi@@ der picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 7-@@ 0@@ 8 , they have been one of the two Prem@@ ier League c@@ lu@@ bs to lose most days through injury .
W@@ en@@ ger ac@@ c@@ ep@@ ts the potential of a vicious c@@ ir@@ c@@ le but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
" Sometimes , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to str@@ eng@@ then your body and gain competition , " said W@@ en@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body st@@ ab@@ il@@ i@@ s@@ es , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he des@@ er@@ ves .
With Arsenal beginning their Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League campaign on Wednesday night against D@@ in@@ am@@ o Z@@ ag@@ re@@ b ahead of m@@ at@@ ches with Chelsea on Saturday and T@@ o@@ t@@ ten@@ ham Ho@@ t@@ sp@@ u@@ r next Wednesday , W@@ en@@ ger is pre@@ par@@ ing to ro@@ t@@ ate his team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor B@@ ell@@ er@@ í@@ n and Aaron R@@ am@@ sey have not tra@@ v@@ elled to Cro@@ at@@ i@@ a , meaning Ma@@ th@@ i@@ e@@ u D@@ e@@ b@@ u@@ ch@@ y and Ar@@ te@@ t@@ a are likely to start .
W@@ en@@ ger may also begin with K@@ i@@ er@@ an Gibbs and O@@ li@@ vi@@ er G@@ i@@ rou@@ d in place of N@@ a@@ ch@@ o Mon@@ real and T@@ h@@ e@@ o Wal@@ co@@ t@@ t .
" I try to keep the balance and give a little bre@@ ather to players who need it , " said W@@ en@@ ger .
Although Arsenal are clear f@@ a@@ vo@@ ur@@ it@@ es to progress through Group F , the M@@ ak@@ si@@ m@@ ir st@@ a@@ di@@ um in Z@@ ag@@ re@@ b is among Europe 's most in@@ tim@@ id@@ ating .
D@@ in@@ am@@ o are also unbeaten in 4@@ 1 m@@ at@@ ches after p@@ ro@@ du@@ c@@ ing their own " In@@ v@@ in@@ c@@ i@@ ble " campaign last season .
The st@@ a@@ di@@ um was s@@ ha@@ ken on Tuesday night by an e@@ ar@@ th tre@@ m@@ or that m@@ e@@ as@@ ured 3@@ .@@ 2 on the R@@ ich@@ ter .
It was the 10@@ th in Z@@ ag@@ re@@ b this year .
W@@ en@@ ger believes that Arsenal have le@@ ar@@ n@@ t the lesson of last season 's Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League c@@ a@@ p@@ it@@ ul@@ ation against Mon@@ ac@@ o and remains dri@@ v@@ en by the di@@ st@@ ant hope of man@@ ag@@ ing the club to a first European Cup triumph .
" This drive is im@@ men@@ se , " said W@@ en@@ ger .
It has never been done at Arsenal .
We were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be real@@ istic .

F@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ s@@ F@@ est : the com@@ e@@ d@@ y show that taught us serious l@@ es@@ s@@ on@@ s about m@@ al@@ e fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship
The absence of similar p@@ or@@ tra@@ y@@ als in shows is g@@ l@@ ar@@ ing , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more des@@ per@@ ate now than ever , with su@@ icide rates am@@ on@@ g@@ s@@ t young m@@ ales at 15 year high .
In 20@@ 13 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men ag@@ ed 20-@@ 45 in the U@@ K , and remains three times more common in m@@ ales than f@@ em@@ ales .
In a bid to address the problem , the C@@ am@@ p@@ a@@ ig@@ n A@@ g@@ ain@@ s@@ t Li@@ ving M@@ i@@ s@@ er@@ ab@@ ly ( C@@ A@@ L@@ M ) announced 20@@ 15 as the Year of the M@@ al@@ e , aim@@ ing to challenge the culture that pre@@ v@@ ent@@ s men from seeking help when they need it .
F@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ ship li@@ es at the h@@ e@@ art of the battle to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high@@ -@@ school students disp@@ l@@ ay@@ ing de@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ v@@ e sy@@ mp@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ s found that if the su@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ er had a high enough per@@ c@@ ent@@ age of " h@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y mood " friends , their ch@@ an@@ ces of re@@ covering doubled .
E@@ qu@@ ally , for those not depressed , a c@@ ir@@ c@@ le of m@@ ent@@ ally h@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y friends hal@@ v@@ ed the ch@@ an@@ ces of mental challenges ar@@ i@@ s@@ ing .
But of course , for fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship to work , it ne@@ e@@ ds to be ac@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ble in the first place .
In this age of so@@ c@@ i@@ al-@@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , im@@ medi@@ acy of response is often pri@@ or@@ it@@ ised over m@@ e@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ ful con@@ t@@ act .
Our di@@ g@@ it@@ al li@@ ves have doubled the need to appear strong , f@@ un@@ -@@ lo@@ ving and successful , even if in reality i@@ s@@ ol@@ ation is king .
This super@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ al success is d@@ o@@ m@@ in@@ ated by what psych@@ ologists term e@@ x@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c v@@ al@@ ues ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ c v@@ al@@ ues - our in@@ ner year@@ n@@ ing for per@@ s@@ on@@ al growth and fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship - that more deeply im@@ p@@ acts our mental health .
And as a b@@ illi@@ onaire vi@@ de@@ o-@@ game c@@ re@@ ator e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed recently , money really doesn 't buy greater ha@@ p@@ p@@ in@@ ess .
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
Each of the characters were not de@@ fin@@ ed by their work , but rather their per@@ s@@ on@@ al@@ it@@ i@@ es , which sh@@ one through the inter@@ action as friends .
The h@@ um@@ our of J@@ o@@ ey and Ch@@ an@@ d@@ ler 's fre@@ qu@@ ent h@@ u@@ g@@ s , m@@ o@@ m@@ ent@@ s watching football on the com@@ fy ch@@ a@@ ir@@ s , and Ro@@ s@@ s 's p@@ in@@ ing for Rach@@ el , came from the knowledge that y@@ es , men can all rel@@ ate to this , even if they often hold back from fully exploring their fe@@ el@@ ings .
As a S@@ am@@ ar@@ it@@ an worker e@@ x@@ pl@@ ain@@ ed to me : .@@ .@@ .. " my list@@ en@@ ing role to people feeling depressed and su@@ i@@ c@@ id@@ al has really high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted how even the s@@ m@@ all@@ est inter@@ actions from friends can make a di@@ f@@ f@@ er@@ ence . "
O@@ f@@ ten the men who con@@ t@@ act us feel unable to speak to friends .
The old ad@@ age of " getting on with it " is strong , as is the sense that it will be per@@ c@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ed as w@@ e@@ ak to open up about problems . "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term cop@@ ing m@@ e@@ ch@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ms .
It high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted the little m@@ o@@ m@@ ent@@ s of m@@ al@@ e fri@@ en@@ d@@ ship .
As much as my objective , out@@ si@@ der status over the phone helps people in m@@ o@@ m@@ ent@@ s of des@@ per@@ ation , the long-term support comes from a close , per@@ s@@ on@@ al family and friend network .
And so , if you attend Com@@ e@@ d@@ y Centr@@ al 's F@@ ri@@ en@@ d@@ s@@ F@@ est this weekend , with the sets fully re@@ designed in c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ ation , why not take your friends for a drink at Centr@@ al Per@@ k .

D@@ i Maria scores to help P@@ S@@ G s@@ w@@ at aside Mal@@ m@@ o
An@@ g@@ e@@ l D@@ i Maria c@@ el@@ e@@ b@@ rates with B@@ la@@ ise M@@ at@@ u@@ id@@ i and E@@ d@@ inson C@@ av@@ ani after sc@@ or@@ ing against Mal@@ m@@ o .
An@@ g@@ e@@ l D@@ i Maria scored on his Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League debut to help P@@ S@@ G e@@ as@@ e past S@@ w@@ e@@ di@@ s@@ h side Mal@@ m@@ o on Tuesday .
Here 's the match report and re@@ action to the game .
An@@ g@@ e@@ l D@@ i Maria and E@@ d@@ inson C@@ av@@ ani were on target as Paris S@@ ain@@ t@@ -@@ G@@ er@@ main began their Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-@@ 0 win against Mal@@ m@@ o at the P@@ ar@@ c des Princ@@ es on Tuesday .
D@@ i Maria scored less than four minutes into his Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League debut as a P@@ S@@ G player to set the French ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s on their way , but they missed a su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ on of op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es before finally e@@ x@@ ten@@ ding their advantage when C@@ av@@ ani head@@ ed home in the 6@@ 1@@ s@@ t minute .
With Real Mad@@ ri@@ d and Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ ar D@@ on@@ e@@ t@@ s@@ k also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the S@@ w@@ e@@ di@@ s@@ h ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s as they target not just qu@@ al@@ i@@ fication for the k@@ n@@ o@@ ck@@ out ro@@ un@@ ds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three camp@@ a@@ ig@@ n@@ s .
But while they got the points , it was not a v@@ in@@ t@@ age display by L@@ a@@ u@@ rent B@@ l@@ an@@ c 's side with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vi@@ c w@@ ast@@ eful in front of goal and later being sub@@ st@@ it@@ ut@@ ed against his h@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ own team and the club with whom he started his illu@@ stri@@ ou@@ s career back in 1999 .
" It 's not easy to win at home or away in the Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League , so to win 2-@@ 0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to per@@ f@@ ec@@ t as the season go@@ es on , " said B@@ l@@ an@@ c .
It a@@ u@@ g@@ ur@@ s well .
We wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two go@@ als more .
I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vi@@ c re@@ turned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-@@ 2 draw at home by B@@ or@@ de@@ a@@ u@@ x in L@@ ig@@ ue 1 at the weekend , but he was u@@ p@@ st@@ ag@@ ed in the fourth minute by D@@ i Maria .
The Argentina w@@ in@@ g@@ er was lab@@ elled as the man to take P@@ S@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from M@@ an@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ er United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Mar@@ co V@@ er@@ r@@ att@@ i 's pass in behind the Mal@@ m@@ o def@@ ence before ang@@ ling a beautiful finish past J@@ oh@@ an Wil@@ and and into the far cor@@ ner of the net .
However , if anyone then expected P@@ S@@ G to ro@@ m@@ p to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ m@@ o , who beat C@@ el@@ tic in a pl@@ ay@@ -off to reach this stage , l@@ in@@ ed up with nine full inter@@ nation@@ als on the field at k@@ ick@@ -off and , with a fi@@ v@@ e-@@ man def@@ ence and two deep in mid@@ field , were st@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ y opponents .
But , save for a N@@ i@@ k@@ ola D@@ j@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic shot that sli@@ d just wide of K@@ e@@ v@@ in T@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ p 's far post in the 3@@ 4@@ th minute , they offered little in attack .
In@@ st@@ e@@ ad , P@@ S@@ G let themselves down at times with some w@@ ast@@ eful passing and poor fin@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing , not least from I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vi@@ c , who failed to con@@ v@@ er@@ t no fewer than five at@@ te@@ mp@@ ts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by C@@ av@@ ani just after the re@@ start .
Ne@@ v@@ er@@ th@@ el@@ ess , he proved much more a@@ de@@ p@@ t when it came to se@@ t@@ ting up his colleagues , and it was from an I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vi@@ c pass that D@@ i Maria sent in a cur@@ ling shot which was ti@@ pped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark th@@ an@@ ks to C@@ av@@ ani , the U@@ ru@@ g@@ u@@ ay@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vi@@ c had fli@@ ck@@ ed on a le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ wing c@@ ro@@ s@@ s from Maxwell .
That ended any i@@ de@@ as that Mal@@ m@@ o had of coming back into the game , and only a super@@ b stop by Wil@@ and from po@@ in@@ t@@ -@@ blan@@ k range to deny David L@@ u@@ i@@ z kept the final score down before sub@@ st@@ it@@ ute E@@ z@@ e@@ qu@@ i@@ e@@ l L@@ av@@ e@@ z@@ z@@ i had a goal di@@ s@@ allowed right at the death .

L@@ on@@ d@@ on-@@ li@@ sted Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
The company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with tumbling com@@ mo@@ d@@ ity prices as China 's economic s@@ lo@@ w@@ down w@@ e@@ i@@ gh@@ s on demand and sp@@ ar@@ k@@ s ha@@ vo@@ c across m@@ ar@@ k@@ ets .

Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ing will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday .
The visit , X@@ i 's first official one to Washington , will take place on Sept . 25 and re@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ro@@ c@@ at@@ es President Barack Obama 's trip to Beijing last November , the statement said .
The U.S. President and First Lady M@@ ich@@ el@@ le Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife P@@ en@@ g Li@@ yuan at a state d@@ in@@ ner that evening , after the two leaders have engaged in b@@ il@@ at@@ er@@ al talks .

X@@ i , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington , before going on to New York City for the U.N. General A@@ s@@ se@@ m@@ b@@ ly on Sept .
Obama and X@@ i are expected to bro@@ a@@ ch a range of con@@ ten@@ ti@@ ou@@ s issues , including Washington 's concerns over China 's alleged c@@ y@@ b@@ er@@ es@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ age and its increasing as@@ s@@ er@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in the disp@@ ut@@ ed waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : Pe@@ p Guar@@ di@@ ola pre@@ vent@@ ed s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to FC Bay@@ er@@ n in 2008
World and European ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion X@@ av@@ i has played for the al@@ -S@@ add Sport Club in Q@@ at@@ ar since su@@ m@@ m@@ er 20@@ 15 .
A few years ago , FC Bay@@ er@@ n was a@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly close to com@@ mit@@ ting to Spain 's super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona .
E@@ ig@@ h@@ t times Spanish ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion , three times c@@ up win@@ ner , four times Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League win@@ ner , twice club world ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion , twice European ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion , one time world ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion - X@@ av@@ i 's list of tit@@ l@@ es is bre@@ a@@ th@@ -@@ taking .
In the su@@ m@@ m@@ er the then 3@@ 5@@ -year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and trans@@ fer@@ red to Q@@ at@@ ar and the al@@ -S@@ add Sport Club .
But in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i re@@ ve@@ als now that just before the 2008 European Championship he was read@@ y to leave Barcelona .
" I was told that Bar@@ ç@@ a wanted to sell me . "
" At the time Mad@@ ri@@ d were winning everything and we weren 't , " he says .
And FC Bay@@ er@@ n n@@ o@@ tic@@ ed that too .
X@@ av@@ i : " There was an offer from Bay@@ er@@ n . "
" R@@ um@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . "
A quick re@@ m@@ in@@ der : in the su@@ m@@ m@@ er of 2008 , J@@ ü@@ r@@ gen K@@ l@@ in@@ s@@ man@@ n took over at FC Bay@@ er@@ n .
Guar@@ di@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not transfer .
The transfer never ha@@ p@@ p@@ en@@ ed .
And instead the crucial man now works for the German record ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion : Pe@@ p Guar@@ di@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why . " Bar@@ ç@@ a had signed on Guar@@ di@@ ola and I played a b@@ r@@ illi@@ ant European Championship . "
" P@@ ep@@ e told me that I sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't transfer , that he couldn 't im@@ ag@@ ine the team without me . "
" He got me with that . "
Who knows how Bay@@ er@@ n 's 2008 / 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 9 season would have turned out if X@@ av@@ i had left .
X@@ av@@ i co@@ v@@ er@@ ed the en@@ ti@@ re distance on the tur@@ f for Bar@@ ç@@ a in the quarter final of the Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League against Bay@@ er@@ n , k@@ n@@ o@@ ck@@ ed the Re@@ ds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the pre@@ m@@ i@@ er@@ e class triumph .
Matt D@@ am@@ on down@@ plays diversity in fil@@ m@@ making
Matt D@@ am@@ on con@@ f@@ r@@ on@@ ted A@@ f@@ ri@@ can@@ -@@ American fil@@ m@@ maker E@@ f@@ f@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn 't needed behind the sc@@ en@@ es .
During Sunday night 's episode of H@@ B@@ O 's Project G@@ re@@ en@@ light , the se@@ as@@ on@@ ed actor cut Brown off while she was em@@ p@@ ha@@ si@@ z@@ ing the need for alternative per@@ spectives regarding a black p@@ ro@@ t@@ ag@@ on@@ ist in the project 's chosen sc@@ re@@ en@@ play .
" When we 're talking about diversity you do it in the c@@ ast@@ ing of the film not in the c@@ ast@@ ing of the show , " D@@ am@@ on as@@ s@@ er@@ ted .
Sho@@ ck@@ ed , Brown re@@ acted with off@@ en@@ ded disbelief , le@@ t@@ ting out " Ho@@ o ! W@@ o@@ w . Ok@@ ay , " as The Mar@@ ti@@ an actor 's comments settled in the air .
D@@ am@@ on and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben A@@ f@@ f@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show 's fin@@ alists .
" I would urge people to think about -- w@@ h@@ o@@ ever the director is , how they 're going to tre@@ at the char@@ ac@@ ter of Har@@ m@@ on@@ y , " Brown initially said .
The only black char@@ ac@@ ter who 's a h@@ oo@@ ker who gets hit by her white p@@ im@@ p .
The De@@ ar White People producer pushed for fin@@ alists Le@@ o An@@ g@@ el@@ os and K@@ ri@@ st@@ en B@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ ac@@ c@@ i@@ o for the rights to direct the film ; D@@ am@@ on re@@ t@@ or@@ ted their direc@@ ting could " end up giving us something we don 't want . "
After the discussion ai@@ red , social media exploded in disap@@ p@@ ro@@ v@@ al over D@@ am@@ on 's comments .
T@@ w@@ it@@ ter us@@ er M@@ r@@ Po@@ oni expressed an@@ ger toward the cli@@ p writing , " Matt D@@ am@@ on speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is S@@ O WH@@ IT@@ E it h@@ ur@@ ts . "
The t@@ w@@ e@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ t@@ w@@ e@@ ets and 4,000 likes since being posted .
D@@ am@@ on 's comments come at a time where ac@@ c@@ ur@@ ate r@@ ac@@ ial re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ ation in media is at the forefront of social discussion .
After te@@ en Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 20@@ 14 , the Black Li@@ ves M@@ at@@ ter movement took nationwide effect , urging law@@ m@@ ak@@ ers and authorities to halt di@@ sc@@ ri@@ m@@ in@@ at@@ or@@ y p@@ r@@ ac@@ ti@@ ces against people of color .
In February , singer Prince all@@ u@@ ded to the movement while in@@ tro@@ du@@ c@@ ing the nominees of Al@@ b@@ um of the Year at the Grammy A@@ war@@ ds .
" Al@@ b@@ um@@ s still matter , " he said .
Li@@ k@@ e b@@ oo@@ ks and black li@@ ves , albums still matter .
More recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves M@@ at@@ ter movement released a statement in response to Fox News per@@ s@@ on@@ ality El@@ i@@ s@@ a@@ be@@ th H@@ as@@ s@@ el@@ be@@ ck 's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group .
" The Black Li@@ ves M@@ at@@ ter Network is a love group , " leaders said .

'@@ American N@@ in@@ j@@ a War@@ ri@@ or ' c@@ ro@@ w@@ n@@ s first ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion
Pro@@ -@@ ro@@ ck clim@@ b@@ er and b@@ us@@ boy I@@ sa@@ a@@ c Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o became the first athlete to win American N@@ in@@ j@@ a War@@ ri@@ or Monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
The competition show , which just w@@ r@@ a@@ pped up its 7th season , has never seen any com@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ itor complete all st@@ ag@@ es of its ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le course .
During the season fin@@ al@@ e , two men , Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o and camer@@ aman Geoff B@@ r@@ it@@ ten , made it to the final round .
The final t@@ ask involved clim@@ b@@ ing a 7@@ 5-@@ foot ro@@ p@@ e in 30 se@@ con@@ ds .
B@@ r@@ it@@ ten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the f@@ ir@@ st@@ -@@ ever athlete to complete American N@@ in@@ j@@ a War@@ ri@@ or 's g@@ ru@@ eling stage 4 , however , Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o finished the challenge a full three se@@ con@@ ds faster making him the win@@ ner .
Cal@@ di@@ er@@ o spoke with E ! News after the hard-@@ fought victory , still in sh@@ o@@ ck about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
" I mean it 's am@@ a@@ z@@ ing to think about , like I 've never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , " I@@ sa@@ a@@ c told E ! of his serious p@@ ay@@ -@@ b@@ um@@ p .
So to all of a su@@ d@@ d@@ en ... like I can 't even im@@ ag@@ ine what it 's going to be like ... the future is un@@ k@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ n .
Executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed s@@ at down with The Hollywood Re@@ p@@ or@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ al@@ e and why , despite B@@ r@@ it@@ ten being the first ever com@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ itor to finish the course , won 't be awarded any prize money .
By the r@@ ul@@ es , the money go@@ es to the f@@ ast@@ est person .
" If there 's more than one fin@@ isher , the one with the f@@ ast@@ est time gets it , " said We@@ ed .
As much as the money is a w@@ on@@ der@@ ful prize and life ch@@ ang@@ ing , he does get the great g@@ r@@ at@@ i@@ fication .
I don 't think he har@@ b@@ ors any ill will about it .
He 's just so happy to have done what he 's done .
He 's received t@@ on@@ s of ac@@ c@@ ol@@ ad@@ es from fans .
He 's such a great guy , and a family man .
He 's a hero to his k@@ ids and his wife .
Geoff said to me , " If I was going to be beat by someone , I 'm g@@ la@@ d it 's I@@ sa@@ a@@ c . "
And I think I@@ sa@@ a@@ c would have felt the same way if they roles were re@@ v@@ er@@ s@@ ed .
America N@@ in@@ j@@ a War@@ ri@@ or was renewed for an eighth season , which will begin fil@@ m@@ ing in Sp@@ r@@ ing 20@@ 16 .
Detroit Tigers ti@@ p@@ toe past Minnesota T@@ wins
M@@ IN@@ NE@@ A@@ P@@ O@@ L@@ I@@ S -- The second half the season hasn 't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers .
Once one of the best teams in baseball , the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Centr@@ al .
Re@@ du@@ c@@ ing to being a sp@@ o@@ iler , the Tigers played the part per@@ f@@ ec@@ t@@ ly Tuesday , beating the Minnesota T@@ wins 5-@@ 4 at T@@ ar@@ get F@@ i@@ el@@ d .
The T@@ wins s@@ qu@@ an@@ der@@ ed a chance to clim@@ b to within one-@@ half game of the Houston A@@ st@@ ro@@ s for the second American League w@@ il@@ d@@ -@@ card sp@@ o@@ t .
For Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the th@@ re@@ e-@@ letter F@@ -@@ word that has been so el@@ u@@ si@@ v@@ e over much of the season 's second half .
" All wins are fun , no matter how it happens , " Tigers manager B@@ r@@ a@@ d A@@ us@@ m@@ us said .
Tigers p@@ it@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do S@@ im@@ on made his early off@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ e support hold up , as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings , then t@@ ack@@ ed one in the sixth and one more in the ninth .
S@@ im@@ on ( 13-@@ 9 ) p@@ it@@ ched 6 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs .
It was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
" I just want to finish strong this year , " S@@ im@@ on said .
It 's hard for the bul@@ l@@ p@@ en to throw every game , and that 's why I want to go deep into the game .
Tigers des@@ ign@@ ated hitter V@@ i@@ c@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and drove in two runs , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid-@@ August .
It was Mart@@ ine@@ z 's first th@@ re@@ e-@@ hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
" He s@@ w@@ un@@ g the bat well , " A@@ us@@ m@@ us said .
He looked good in ( b@@ at@@ ting practice ) , looked n@@ o@@ tic@@ e@@ ab@@ ly better in B@@ P , and he carried it right into the game .
T@@ r@@ a@@ iling by three runs in the bo@@ t@@ to@@ m of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
Center fielder B@@ y@@ r@@ on Bu@@ xton led off the inning with a double down the left field line .
R@@ ig@@ h@@ t fielder Aaron Hicks re@@ a@@ ch@@ ed on a b@@ un@@ t single , and S@@ im@@ on got second baseman Brian Do@@ z@@ ier to strike out s@@ w@@ in@@ g@@ ing before being li@@ f@@ ted for le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ h@@ an@@ der B@@ la@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy walked M@@ a@@ u@@ er , the only man he faced , ahead of ro@@ o@@ k@@ ie des@@ ign@@ ated hitter M@@ ig@@ u@@ el San@@ o , who ripped a two-run single to left off ri@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ h@@ an@@ der Drew V@@ er@@ H@@ ag@@ en .
With a pair of runners on and the t@@ y@@ ing run at second , V@@ er@@ H@@ ag@@ en got third baseman T@@ re@@ v@@ or P@@ l@@ ou@@ f@@ f@@ e to ground into a double play .
It was the m@@ a@@ j@@ or-@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ e-@@ leading 27@@ th time this season that P@@ l@@ ou@@ f@@ f@@ e hit into a D@@ P .
After Detroit t@@ ack@@ ed on an insurance run in the top of the ninth , M@@ a@@ u@@ er ripped an R@@ B@@ I double to the gap against Tigers closer B@@ ru@@ ce R@@ on@@ don to make it 5-@@ 4 .
However , the ri@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ h@@ an@@ der struck out San@@ o on three p@@ it@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit took advantage of a ru@@ st@@ y P@@ h@@ il Hu@@ gh@@ es in the early going .
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran ri@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ h@@ an@@ der , who came off the di@@ s@@ ab@@ led list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back infl@@ am@@ m@@ ation .
" O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously not the start I 'd like to have , " Hu@@ gh@@ es said , " but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to e@@ x@@ ec@@ ute some pretty good p@@ it@@ ches there in the third inning . "
After getting the le@@ ad@@ off b@@ at@@ ter in the first , H@@ ush@@ es gave up a single to second baseman Ian K@@ in@@ s@@ ler .
A two-@@ out walk to right fielder J@@ .@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought up V@@ i@@ c@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who s@@ in@@ g@@ led up the middle for the first run of the game .
V@@ i@@ c@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z snapped his 0-@@ for-@@ 21 streak with runners in sc@@ or@@ ing position .
Third baseman N@@ ick C@@ a@@ st@@ ell@@ an@@ os fol@@ lo@@ w@@ ed with a single to right , sc@@ or@@ ing another run , but V@@ i@@ c@@ tor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
The Tigers added on in the second , getting a one-@@ out double from catcher James McCann and a two-@@ out single by center fielder An@@ th@@ ony G@@ o@@ se to make it 3-@@ 0 .
" That was a big hit , " T@@ wins manager Paul M@@ ol@@ itor said .
He didn 't hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right sp@@ o@@ t .
Hu@@ gh@@ es , who was on a pitch count , p@@ it@@ ched a sco@@ rel@@ ess third inning before being re@@ plac@@ ed by ri@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ h@@ an@@ d@@ ed re@@ li@@ e@@ ver A.@@ J. A@@ ch@@ ter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts .
N@@ O@@ T@@ E@@ S : Tigers R@@ H@@ P An@@ ib@@ al Sanchez was shut down with a stra@@ in in his throwing shoulder .
He will be e@@ x@@ am@@ in@@ ed by Dr. James Andrews , who performed surgery on Sanchez 's shoulder back in 2007 .
Sanchez , on the di@@ s@@ ab@@ led list with a shoulder stra@@ in since mid-@@ August , was scheduled to be ac@@ tiv@@ ated for a Wednesday start .
With Sanchez out , L@@ H@@ P Daniel Nor@@ r@@ is will come off the D@@ L to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ r@@ is is 1-@@ 1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for L@@ H@@ P David Price on July 30 .
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a stra@@ in@@ ed right ob@@ li@@ que .
The Tigers and T@@ wins will w@@ r@@ a@@ p up their th@@ re@@ e-@@ game series at T@@ ar@@ get F@@ i@@ el@@ d on Wednesday .
Nor@@ r@@ is ( 2-@@ 2 , 4.@@ 4@@ 3 E@@ R@@ A ) will oppose Minnesota R@@ H@@ P E@@ r@@ v@@ in S@@ an@@ t@@ ana ( 5-@@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 E@@ R@@ A ) .
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es to be given ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation in Wi@@ es@@ b@@ a@@ d@@ en
A train carrying hundreds of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es is on the way to H@@ esse .
They are expected to arrive by Wednesday night .
The people who have tra@@ v@@ elled there will then be housed in emergency shelters in Wi@@ es@@ b@@ a@@ d@@ en , according to a statement made by the city of Wi@@ es@@ b@@ a@@ d@@ en on Tuesday evening .
They estimate that between 4@@ 50 and 750 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es will arrive .
A number of sp@@ or@@ ts halls in the H@@ es@@ si@@ an capital have been pre@@ p@@ a@@ red for this event@@ u@@ ality over the last few days .
U@@ p to 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es can be provided with temporary ac@@ com@@ mo@@ d@@ ation in these .
After this they should be re@@ distributed to other communities .
According to a statement by the regional council of G@@ i@@ es@@ sen , responsible for their initial reception , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse in the past ten days alone

I@@ s@@ ch@@ in@@ g@@ er : German military action in Syria an option
The head of the M@@ un@@ i@@ ch Security Conference , W@@ ol@@ f@@ g@@ an@@ g I@@ s@@ ch@@ in@@ g@@ er , believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a po@@ s@@ si@@ b@@ ility .
" I believe that de@@ ter@@ m@@ in@@ ed con@@ si@@ der@@ ation about military co@@ ur@@ s@@ es of action should not take place without Germany , " he said .
He accused the European n@@ ations of " c@@ olle@@ c@@ tiv@@ ely looking the other way . "
Four years ago one would have been happy for the ch@@ al@@ i@@ c@@ e of military involvement to pass Germany by .
" Now the con@@ fli@@ c@@ t has come cr@@ ash@@ ing down at our front do@@ or , " he said on the German World Service .
The former German Am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid lo@@ c@@ ally for the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
Au@@ stri@@ a running checks on southern and eastern bor@@ der@@ s
According to Germany , Au@@ stri@@ a has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern bor@@ der@@ s .
The Au@@ stri@@ an Interior Minister , J@@ oh@@ ann@@ a Mi@@ k@@ l@@ -@@ L@@ e@@ it@@ ner , st@@ ated on the Au@@ stri@@ an television channel OR@@ F on Tuesday evening that currently n@@ o@@ body is being sent back to H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y .
N@@ or has Germany sent any re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es back to Au@@ stri@@ a .
" No , that is the agreement , " she confirmed .
On the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es per day can be taken to go to Germany from Au@@ stri@@ a , Mi@@ k@@ l@@ -@@ L@@ e@@ it@@ ner said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ at@@ i@@ ves of Germany .
She gave no specific figures and re@@ fer@@ red to talks in B@@ er@@ lin on Wednesday .
Over the last few days ten@@ s of thousands of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es have arrived in Au@@ stri@@ a from H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y over the so@@ -@@ called B@@ al@@ k@@ an rou@@ te .
Most of them are heading to Germany .
German Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or An@@ g@@ el@@ a M@@ er@@ k@@ el ( C@@ D@@ U ) and her Au@@ stri@@ an c@@ olle@@ ag@@ ue , W@@ er@@ ner F@@ ay@@ man@@ n , together with a number of other EU states and heads of government , are p@@ ro@@ po@@ s@@ ing a special summit for next week .
On Sunday Germany started to im@@ po@@ se temporary border controls .
To date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis .
At a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU inter@@ i@@ or ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory re@@ di@@ stri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on of a further 1@@ 20,000 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
In view of the heavy in@@ f@@ lu@@ x of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es into Germany , the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial reception and di@@ stri@@ b@@ u@@ ti@@ on of people .
The Federal government will man@@ age this jo@@ in@@ t@@ ly with the states , announced M@@ er@@ k@@ el late on Tuesday evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or 's office in B@@ er@@ lin .
M@@ er@@ k@@ el stressed that those people who need protection will get it .
But those who have no p@@ ro@@ spec@@ ts of per@@ man@@ ent re@@ si@@ den@@ cy will not be able to stay in Germany .

On Monday night H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y closed its 175 km long border with Ser@@ b@@ ia .
A few hours later the government in Bud@@ a@@ p@@ est announced that it was also going to se@@ al off the border with R@@ o@@ m@@ an@@ ia with a fence .

H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y wants to prevent people s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers finding alternative ro@@ ut@@ es through R@@ o@@ m@@ an@@ ia , said H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y 's Foreign Minister Peter S@@ z@@ i@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to about the planned new border fences .
The R@@ o@@ m@@ an@@ ian government immediately condemned the plan .
The first ar@@ re@@ st@@ s of people who had bre@@ a@@ ch@@ ed the fence have taken place .

" C@@ as@@ s@@ in@@ i " sp@@ ace probe fin@@ ds ocean on S@@ at@@ ur@@ n 's moon En@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us
Under the i@@ c@@ y cr@@ us@@ t of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n 's moon En@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us sp@@ l@@ as@@ h@@ es a global ocean .
Sci@@ en@@ ti@@ st@@ s have de@@ du@@ c@@ ed this from ob@@ serving the " C@@ as@@ s@@ in@@ i " sp@@ ace probe
This is the reason the moon w@@ ob@@ b@@ l@@ es slightly in its or@@ bit of the ring@@ ed pl@@ an@@ et .
This w@@ ob@@ b@@ l@@ ing is only m@@ in@@ or , but ne@@ v@@ er@@ th@@ el@@ ess too much for a so@@ li@@ d c@@ el@@ e@@ st@@ ial body , it was st@@ ated on Tuesday in a communication from Cor@@ n@@ el@@ l University in I@@ th@@ ica in the US state of New York .
The s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ st@@ s have published their fin@@ d@@ ings in the " I@@ car@@ us " s@@ c@@ i@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ c jo@@ ur@@ n@@ al .
It has long been known that there must be li@@ qu@@ id water under En@@ c@@ el@@ ad@@ us 's cr@@ us@@ t of i@@ c@@ e .
" C@@ as@@ s@@ in@@ i " had already discovered i@@ c@@ e v@@ ol@@ can@@ o@@ es , which sp@@ e@@ w water v@@ a@@ p@@ our and i@@ c@@ e partic@@ l@@ es that fe@@ ed the so@@ -@@ called E ring of S@@ at@@ ur@@ n , at the s@@ ou@@ th p@@ ol@@ e of this moon in 2006 .
A@@ st@@ on@@ o@@ m@@ ers concluded at the time that there had to be a sub@@ surface sea at least at the s@@ ou@@ th p@@ ol@@ e .
The extent of the h@@ id@@ d@@ en ocean was however not clear .
R@@ ama ab@@ sent from 18@@ 60 M@@ un@@ i@@ ch for several weeks
18@@ 60 M@@ un@@ i@@ ch must do without attacking mid@@ fielder V@@ al@@ de@@ t R@@ ama for about a month .
An e@@ x@@ am@@ in@@ ation revealed that the 27@@ -year-old has suffered an ad@@ du@@ c@@ tor injury , the club revealed .
R@@ ama had complained of pain at the beginning of the week .
According to the M@@ un@@ i@@ ch Lions , the di@@ ag@@ n@@ o@@ sis m@@ e@@ ans " probably a four week com@@ p@@ ul@@ s@@ or@@ y break . "
" It 's hit us hard . R@@ ama is a bitter loss . "
" We have to think about it of course , " Sports Di@@ rec@@ tor N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ü@@ n told the " B@@ il@@ d " newspaper , regarding the possible eng@@ age@@ ment of a professional who is not att@@ a@@ ch@@ ed to a club .
However the next training g@@ u@@ est the se@@ x@@ ag@@ en@@ ar@@ ian is due to present is a def@@ en@@ der .
Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y-@@ ye@@ ar@@ -@@ old H@@ r@@ vo@@ j@@ e C@@ al@@ e last played in Belgium and was f@@ or@@ mer@@ ly under contract to V@@ f@@ L W@@ ol@@ f@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
At the moment the Cro@@ at@@ i@@ an has " the opportunity to prove himself . "
Following his conc@@ us@@ si@@ on , goal sc@@ or@@ er R@@ u@@ b@@ in O@@ k@@ o@@ ti@@ e is re@@ turning to training with the team in the coming week .

Con@@ tr@@ ar@@ y to initial fears , however , the w@@ o@@ un@@ d was not serious .
Not a di@@ et f@@ ru@@ it - man@@ go@@ es contain a lot of su@@ gar
M@@ an@@ go@@ es are e@@ x@@ o@@ tic , ju@@ i@@ c@@ y and sweet .
But an@@ y@@ body watching their wa@@ i@@ st@@ line should avo@@ id them .
Because man@@ go@@ es have a relatively high su@@ gar content - primarily su@@ c@@ ro@@ se .
The e@@ x@@ o@@ tic f@@ ru@@ it is ne@@ v@@ er@@ th@@ el@@ ess h@@ e@@ al@@ th@@ y : they contain B vit@@ am@@ ins as well as vit@@ am@@ ins E and C. But most of all man@@ go@@ es are full of vit@@ am@@ in A and its pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or , be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ o@@ ten@@ e .
E@@ ating the f@@ ru@@ it b@@ oo@@ st@@ s the si@@ g@@ h@@ t , im@@ m@@ un@@ e system and the body 's m@@ e@@ t@@ abo@@ li@@ c p@@ ro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ es .
When buying man@@ go@@ es they should not be too so@@ f@@ t or too firm and they should have a p@@ le@@ as@@ ant ar@@ oma .
It is not possible to tell from the col@@ our of the sk@@ in how ri@@ p@@ e the f@@ ru@@ it is - even g@@ re@@ en man@@ go@@ es can ta@@ st@@ e d@@ el@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s .
They should be kept at room te@@ m@@ per@@ ature and con@@ su@@ m@@ ed within a few days .
They are d@@ el@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s on their own or in sweet di@@ sh@@ es .
A man@@ go also gives a special touch even to sa@@ vo@@ ur@@ y di@@ sh@@ es .

US par@@ c@@ el service U@@ P@@ S is again taking on up to 9@@ ,@@ 500 temporary staff for its Christmas service in the USA .
The company has already started to rec@@ ru@@ it se@@ as@@ on@@ al workers , U@@ P@@ S reported on Tuesday .
We are lo@@ oo@@ king for drivers in partic@@ ul@@ ar .
In the past few years , U@@ P@@ S increased its work@@ force by 9@@ ,@@ 500 for the four day season .
In light of bo@@ o@@ m@@ ing online business , U@@ P@@ S and its com@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ itor F@@ e@@ d@@ E@@ x have for several years been making provisions earlier in order to be pre@@ p@@ a@@ red for Christmas business .
In 20@@ 13 there was har@@ s@@ h criticism of late deli@@ v@@ er@@ ies by the par@@ c@@ el service .
First a fo@@ e@@ h@@ n storm , then a p@@ r@@ on@@ oun@@ c@@ ed cold front
The fo@@ e@@ h@@ n will break through in the v@@ al@@ le@@ ys on the n@@ or@@ then side of the Al@@ ps in the coming night , Me@@ te@@ o@@ s@@ ch@@ w@@ e@@ i@@ z announced on Tuesday .
The fo@@ e@@ h@@ n will b@@ low through the Fo@@ e@@ h@@ n V@@ al@@ le@@ ys on Wednesday , continuing through the night , sometimes at g@@ al@@ e force .
Once the fo@@ e@@ h@@ n has died away on Thursday morning a prominent cold front will cut across our region , bringing heavy r@@ a@@ in@@ fall , g@@ u@@ st@@ y winds and a drop in te@@ m@@ per@@ ature .
According to Me@@ te@@ o@@ News , S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land is currently facing an extensive area of low pressure being brought from the British I@@ s@@ l@@ es in a strong southwestern flow .
The fo@@ e@@ h@@ n will break through the v@@ al@@ le@@ ys on the northern sides of the Al@@ ps during Tuesday night .
The fo@@ e@@ h@@ n will then b@@ low through the Fo@@ e@@ h@@ n V@@ al@@ le@@ ys until Thursday morning with g@@ u@@ st@@ s of 60 to 100 km / h ; o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ si@@ onally , and particularly in the can@@ ton of U@@ r@@ i , increasing at times to over 100 km / h .
In plac@@ es the fo@@ e@@ h@@ n may advance into the adjacent mid@@ land , and on the mountains g@@ al@@ e force winds of over 120 km / h are even possible .
While in the north st@@ or@@ my fo@@ e@@ h@@ n@@ s on Wednesday will bring su@@ m@@ mer@@ y te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res of 23 to 27 de@@ g@@ re@@ es , mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure will begin to build up on the southern s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the Al@@ ps .
Here it will start to r@@ a@@ in and this will continue until Thursday evening .
Over the next 48 hours the s@@ ou@@ th of the Al@@ ps can expect over 100 lit@@ res of r@@ a@@ in per square m@@ e@@ t@@ re in plac@@ es , following on from a large volume of r@@ a@@ in which has f@@ all@@ en over the last few days .
On Thursday morning the fo@@ e@@ h@@ n will die down , re@@ su@@ l@@ ting in a cold front with heavy , sometimes th@@ un@@ der@@ y r@@ a@@ in ro@@ l@@ ling from west to east over S@@ w@@ it@@ z@@ er@@ land .
In con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with the cold front , the w@@ ind will get str@@ on@@ ger increasing to st@@ or@@ my , and te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res will de@@ c@@ re@@ as@@ e sharply .
The following days will be a@@ u@@ t@@ um@@ n@@ al in the north with te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res of 15 to 20 de@@ g@@ re@@ es , w@@ h@@ er@@ e@@ as in the s@@ ou@@ th it will be sun@@ n@@ ier and war@@ m@@ er at the weekend with te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res up to 25 de@@ g@@ re@@ es .
R@@ o@@ m@@ e now has a Martin L@@ u@@ th@@ er Square
Some 500 years after the Re@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ation , R@@ o@@ m@@ e now has a Martin L@@ u@@ th@@ er Square .
In the presence of the Mayor of the City , I@@ gn@@ a@@ z@@ i@@ o Marino , a hi@@ th@@ er@@ to un@@ named square in the park on the O@@ p@@ p@@ io H@@ ill was on Wednesday be@@ st@@ ow@@ ed with the name of the German re@@ former .
On the " P@@ i@@ a@@ z@@ z@@ a Martin L@@ ut@@ re@@ o " he is now re@@ co@@ gn@@ ised as the " German the@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ an of the Re@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ation . "
The park is in the centre of R@@ o@@ m@@ e right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um
The con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um of E@@ v@@ an@@ g@@ el@@ ical ch@@ ur@@ ches in R@@ o@@ m@@ e proposed the choice of name .
J@@ en@@ s@@ -@@ Martin Kr@@ use , minister of the E@@ v@@ an@@ g@@ el@@ ical L@@ u@@ th@@ er@@ an community in R@@ o@@ m@@ e , recalled on Wednesday that for c@@ ent@@ ur@@ ies Pro@@ te@@ st@@ an@@ ts in the Pop@@ e 's city often had to hi@@ de their f@@ a@@ it@@ h .
The square is a visual sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l that their tradition of the Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ ian f@@ a@@ it@@ h is welcome in R@@ o@@ m@@ e .
As a young Au@@ g@@ u@@ st@@ in@@ ian m@@ on@@ k , Martin L@@ u@@ th@@ er ( 1@@ 4@@ 8@@ 3-@@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in R@@ o@@ m@@ e for a few months at the turn of the year between 15@@ 10 and 15@@ 11 .
At the time he considered the city to be a de@@ gen@@ er@@ ate h@@ o@@ t@@ bed of vice .
According to historians , his negative impres@@ sions may have been re@@ in@@ forced in his later fight against R@@ o@@ m@@ e .
L@@ u@@ th@@ er her@@ al@@ ded the beginning of the Western Ch@@ ur@@ ch with his thes@@ es against the selling of in@@ d@@ ul@@ gen@@ ces .
Tal@@ ent@@ ed artist in@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ s three years in his per@@ s@@ on@@ al inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation of the Bible .
J@@ es@@ us with the ( g@@ il@@ ded ) crown of th@@ or@@ n@@ s is one of the major works that O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t has painted for his Bible .
K@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ s Al@@ te@@ post has w@@ r@@ it@@ ten an introduction and u@@ p@@ d@@ ated the te@@ x@@ t of the Bible .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not in the O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t Bible , which has now been issued with mag@@ n@@ ific@@ ent pictures .
For O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t , who has de@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ ed his own per@@ s@@ on@@ al inter@@ pre@@ t@@ ation of b@@ ib@@ li@@ cal stories in 150 mo@@ ti@@ f@@ s on p@@ a@@ p@@ er and can@@ v@@ as , in the beginning was the picture .
The 7@@ 5@@ -year-old conceived his " language " with bright col@@ ours and im@@ ag@@ in@@ ative f@@ or@@ m@@ s - which are however by no m@@ e@@ ans sy@@ n@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ou@@ s with " f@@ un@@ n@@ y " pictures .
On the con@@ tr@@ ar@@ y : de@@ p@@ en@@ ding on the re@@ spec@@ ti@@ v@@ e th@@ em@@ es , they can appear to be th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly g@@ lo@@ o@@ m@@ y .
O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t worked on his Bible project for around three years and for this project he made a sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ e choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the " B@@ oo@@ k of b@@ oo@@ ks . "
C@@ y@@ c@@ l@@ es e@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ ed , dedicated to t@@ op@@ ics such as the W@@ ay of the C@@ ro@@ s@@ s , pl@@ ag@@ ues , the Com@@ m@@ an@@ d@@ ments or the L@@ or@@ d 's Pra@@ yer .
Without even appro@@ a@@ ch@@ ing them , he immediately att@@ acted mul@@ ti@@ p@@ le par@@ t@@ ners : this app@@ li@@ es to the L@@ u@@ th@@ er V@@ er@@ la@@ g , a p@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ isher spec@@ i@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ing in the@@ ological works as well as the K@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ler V@@ er@@ la@@ g , who focus on p@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing art b@@ oo@@ ks .
And in partic@@ ul@@ ar a@@ u@@ th@@ or K@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ s Al@@ te@@ post , who has g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ pled with the partic@@ ul@@ ar Bible p@@ as@@ sag@@ es based on the paintings .
He has inter@@ pre@@ ted the Bible te@@ x@@ ts s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted by O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t and " trans@@ l@@ ated " them to the current day , in a t@@ op@@ ical con@@ te@@ x@@ t .
These te@@ x@@ ts are like verbal m@@ ir@@ r@@ ors of Al@@ t 's paintings .
They are em@@ be@@ d@@ ded between the original Bible qu@@ o@@ t@@ ations of Martin L@@ u@@ th@@ er and each com@@ position by the artist , who has here f@@ or@@ m@@ ul@@ ated his own per@@ s@@ on@@ al concepts for the re@@ spec@@ ti@@ v@@ e s@@ it@@ u@@ ations .
The decorated cover of the book is le@@ t@@ ter@@ ed in gold .
The 7@@ 5@@ -year-old allows at the same time a tw@@ of@@ old in@@ si@@ g@@ h@@ t , deep into both his sou@@ l and his emo@@ tions .
This is particularly in@@ tim@@ ate .
Ultimately , his emo@@ tions were the key tri@@ g@@ ger for the Bible project : O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t , who was bor@@ n in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ ero@@ de in 1@@ 9@@ 40 and grew up in B@@ er@@ lin , comes from a family b@@ el@@ on@@ ging to the stri@@ c@@ t Pro@@ te@@ st@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ u@@ t order .
" E@@ du@@ c@@ ation there took place under the s@@ ha@@ do@@ w of the can@@ e , " re@@ members O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t .
" I have tried to process this , so that perhaps I can come to terms with the L@@ or@@ d again .
His second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age : " The perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising , which is l@@ oud .
Sy@@ m@@ b@@ ol@@ ism has been dri@@ v@@ en out .
Ar@@ ti@@ st@@ s have a different p@@ as@@ si@@ on and joy in pre@@ s@@ ent@@ ing things .
Pictures always have something m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ ious about them ; they are not de@@ c@@ or@@ ation .
" In this respect , I am a d@@ in@@ os@@ a@@ u@@ r . "
O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t wants his viewers to let themselves " fall into " the pictures , to let them leave their im@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on , to di@@ s@@ cover and experience the power they have : " The picture is looking for its counterpart . "
At the launch of the O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t Bible on Tuesday , K@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ s Al@@ te@@ post con@@ f@@ essed to having " always " been a lo@@ ver of O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t 's art : " I like the way he se@@ es life with his pictures . "
Al@@ t was not interested in recording the whole of the Bible , s@@ el@@ ec@@ ting only the the th@@ em@@ es which were for him the most significant and also the most m@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ ious .
" This wasn 't a c@@ ol@@ l@@ abor@@ ation between par@@ t@@ ners , " says Al@@ te@@ post , " it was about the pictures ; the te@@ x@@ t is merely an explanation . " The result is a picture Bible .
For H@@ ans M@@ ö@@ h@@ ler of the L@@ u@@ th@@ er V@@ er@@ la@@ g this work is an in@@ v@@ itation " to add depth to his life and to find freedom . "
O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t 's pictures speak , for M@@ ö@@ h@@ ler , the ( b@@ ib@@ li@@ cal ) language of love as well as that of re@@ sp@@ on@@ si@@ b@@ ility .
Some of the or@@ ig@@ in@@ als - p@@ a@@ p@@ er and can@@ v@@ as - will be sh@@ own for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15@@ th November in the O@@ t@@ m@@ ar Al@@ t Foundation .
Start of con@@ st@@ ru@@ ction dra@@ ws closer for B@@ M@@ X track
Plans made , site found , company com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed , mo@@ un@@ d for a c@@ ir@@ c@@ u@@ it mo@@ d@@ elled : one year later , everything was nearly finished - but even before the official opening of the B@@ M@@ X track it was closed again .
Polit@@ ical and administrative f@@ a@@ il@@ ings caused an@@ ger , particularly with residents who did not want to put up with the track .
So the mo@@ un@@ d was de@@ m@@ ol@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ed and the search began for a new site - now with a f@@ or@@ m@@ al app@@ lic@@ ation for planning per@@ mission .
A@@ p@@ p@@ ro@@ v@@ al will be received in October , chief local co@@ un@@ c@@ ill@@ or S@@ ab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ b@@ a@@ ch@@ -@@ Bo@@ ch has now been able to in@@ form the children 's and young people 's com@@ mit@@ tee .
" I hope that this year something will be seen to happen , " she said .
The work should then be started without any " further p@@ a@@ u@@ se for th@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t " at the site of the former in@@ do@@ or s@@ w@@ im@@ m@@ ing pool .
D@@ F@@ B steps up its com@@ mit@@ ment to re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es
The German football league gave clear in@@ di@@ c@@ ations at the weekend that the D@@ F@@ B is e@@ x@@ ten@@ ding its com@@ mit@@ ment to re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es to 20@@ 19 .
Football has re@@ acted to the de@@ ter@@ i@@ or@@ ating situation in Germany and p@@ ro@@ mis@@ ed p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans its help with the current problems .
" I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ un@@ ific@@ ation . "
" B@@ a@@ si@@ c@@ ally n@@ o@@ body knows , it 's no concern of m@@ ine , it 's not my doing . "
" It is in the interests of e@@ very@@ body to get to g@@ ri@@ p with this issue , " says D@@ F@@ B chief W@@ ol@@ f@@ g@@ an@@ g N@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ b@@ a@@ ch .
He wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany in@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely at the annual meeting with German Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or An@@ g@@ el@@ a M@@ er@@ k@@ el on 23 September in B@@ er@@ lin .
I 'm going to be in the Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or 's office next Wednesday and I 'm meeting there with State Minister M@@ s Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . "
" I 'm sure the t@@ op@@ ic will play a central role there , " he an@@ n@@ o@@ un@@ ces .
Football can and will help .
But the p@@ ol@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ans must set the de@@ c@@ i@@ ding guidelines .
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee in@@ it@@ i@@ ative " 1 : 0 for a welcome " to four years .
" Through the E@@ g@@ i@@ di@@ us-@@ B@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ n foundation we have en@@ su@@ red that this program will continue until 20@@ 19 , " de@@ c@@ la@@ red N@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ b@@ a@@ ch on the b@@ r@@ ink of the U@@ E@@ FA meeting in St Ju@@ li@@ an 's , Mal@@ t@@ a
Several teams are also supporting the programme .
This very weekend the 36 professional c@@ lu@@ bs will be sen@@ ding out a clear m@@ es@@ s@@ age when they wear the words " We are h@@ el@@ p@@ ing - # re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es@@ welcome " on the left sle@@ e@@ v@@ e of their stri@@ p instead of the usual sp@@ on@@ s@@ or 's lo@@ go ( H@@ er@@ m@@ es ) .
" We are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can , " Le@@ v@@ er@@ k@@ us@@ en 's sport bo@@ s@@ s Rud@@ i V@@ ö@@ l@@ ler told the " B@@ il@@ d " newspaper on Tuesday , and des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es the s@@ ch@@ em@@ e as " a matter of course . "
" The refugee drama concerns everyone , n@@ o@@ body can look away . "
" We football teams can , no , we must use our char@@ i@@ s@@ m@@ a , our influence , and our op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ i@@ es to help the many re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es who have already suffered tremend@@ ously , " says H@@ er@@ th@@ a manager Michael Pre@@ e@@ t@@ z .
H@@ off@@ en@@ heim 's M@@ an@@ ag@@ ing Di@@ rec@@ tor Peter Ret@@ ti@@ g spoke of a prominent si@@ gn@@ al by the league .
The women 's national team is inviting 100 re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es to H@@ alle ( S@@ a@@ al@@ e ) for the World Cup qualifying match against H@@ ung@@ ar@@ y .
N@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ b@@ a@@ ch des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es supporting the re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es as " a grand joint effort by German football . "
It is am@@ a@@ z@@ ing that all 36 lic@@ en@@ s@@ ed c@@ lu@@ bs have started their own projects in their own locations .
It is just as am@@ a@@ z@@ ing that both small and large c@@ lu@@ bs are doing this .
The m@@ es@@ s@@ age " 1 : 0 for a welcome , " that we have sent out is being lived in football .
" That is of enormous significance , " he said .
In both this year and next year the association together with the D@@ F@@ B team and the Federal government are making € 3@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 available for the in@@ te@@ g@@ r@@ ation of re@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ es .
" The c@@ lu@@ bs have already already released the en@@ ti@@ re su@@ m for 20@@ 15 , " reports N@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ b@@ a@@ ch .
Reports : S@@ AP chief executive lo@@ s@@ es an eye in accident
According to several reports , the chief executive of Europe 's largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mo@@ t@@ t , lost his left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
In an accident on the st@@ a@@ ir@@ s in his brother 's h@@ ou@@ se in the USA after midnight , he fell on a water gl@@ ass he was carrying in his left hand , reported the " W@@ ir@@ t@@ s@@ ch@@ af@@ t@@ s@@ w@@ o@@ ch@@ e " on Wednesday .
" He almost b@@ led to death , he was un@@ con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s , then he d@@ r@@ ag@@ ged himself out onto the road - so he told us last week , " the " Wi@@ W@@ o " quoted S@@ AP co@@ -@@ founder H@@ as@@ so P@@ l@@ att@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mo@@ t@@ t will however be able to return to work .
" We are meeting up at the board meeting in W@@ all@@ d@@ or@@ f at the beginning of October , " said P@@ l@@ att@@ ner .
The 5@@ 4@@ -year-old manager will be at the meeting and " fully fit for work . "
Mc@@ Der@@ mo@@ t@@ t announced in an interview with the " S@@ ü@@ d@@ de@@ ut@@ s@@ ch@@ en Z@@ e@@ it@@ un@@ g " ( Thursday 's e@@ d@@ it@@ i@@ on ) that he will come back to Germany in October and take over the lead at the software group again .
" I am de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely there for S@@ AP , com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely involved in my job . "
" I have of course been in regular con@@ t@@ act with the board and its chairman , H@@ as@@ so P@@ l@@ att@@ ner , the whole time , " Mc@@ Der@@ mo@@ t@@ t told the " S@@ Z . "
Mc@@ Der@@ mo@@ t@@ t normally com@@ m@@ ut@@ es between Germany and the USA , but since the su@@ m@@ m@@ er he has no longer been in the S@@ AP German headquarters in W@@ all@@ d@@ or@@ f .
I@@ i is important to him to go public with such a per@@ s@@ on@@ al story , the manager told the " S@@ Z " : " It could happen to anyone . "
" The important thing is to get up again if you fall down . "

Football : B@@ V@@ B v Kr@@ as@@ n@@ o@@ d@@ ar without Re@@ us : W@@ e@@ i@@ den@@ f@@ ell@@ er in goal
All hopes have been crushed for B@@ or@@ us@@ si@@ a D@@ or@@ t@@ m@@ un@@ d that Mar@@ co Re@@ us might make a comeback in the first group match of the European league .
The international player will also be missing from the German B@@ un@@ des@@ li@@ g@@ a leader 's match in its du@@ al with F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ n@@ o@@ d@@ ar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. on Sk@@ y ) .
" Un@@ f@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ ately he isn 't in the running , " said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
The B@@ V@@ B coach is leaving it open as to whether Re@@ us will be there on Sunday in the B@@ un@@ des@@ li@@ g@@ a top match against Le@@ v@@ er@@ k@@ us@@ en : " We are e@@ x@@ p@@ ec@@ ting him to return to training on Friday . "
In light of the heavy burden on his p@@ ro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als , Tu@@ ch@@ el does not want to change his first choice 11 just because of Re@@ us 's position .
So he has announced a change of go@@ al@@ keeper .
Th@@ us R@@ o@@ m@@ an W@@ e@@ i@@ den@@ f@@ ell@@ er is taking the place of regular keeper R@@ o@@ m@@ an B@@ ü@@ r@@ ki .
" He 's training at ab@@ sol@@ ute top level , " p@@ r@@ a@@ ised the world ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion 's football coach .
Tu@@ ch@@ el is leaving it open as to whether W@@ e@@ i@@ den@@ fel@@ der will be used in all European league m@@ at@@ ches in the future .
It is highly likely that he will also play the second game .

Ro@@ bo@@ t cars : Government wants Germany to take a leading role
The Federal Government wants Germany to be te@@ ch@@ n@@ ological leaders in changes to cars .
On Wednesday the German cabinet re@@ sol@@ v@@ ed on a policy document introduced by the Minister of Tran@@ sport Ale@@ x@@ an@@ der Do@@ b@@ r@@ in@@ d@@ t ( CS@@ U ) which provides , among other things , for investment in development of di@@ g@@ it@@ al in@@ f@@ r@@ a@@ structure .
Do@@ b@@ r@@ in@@ d@@ t spoke in F@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ f@@ urt on Wednesday , on the b@@ r@@ ink of the I@@ A@@ A mo@@ tor show , about a " new era of mobility . "
A@@ ut@@ o@@ m@@ ated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer traffic j@@ am@@ s , said Do@@ b@@ r@@ in@@ d@@ t .
He wants to discuss the t@@ op@@ ic with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 countries , who are also meeting with re@@ pre@@ s@@ ent@@ at@@ i@@ ves of industry at the I@@ A@@ A .
The Tran@@ sport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and and a rapid s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to di@@ g@@ it@@ al r@@ a@@ di@@ o .
There is currently a test area on the A@@ 9 motor@@ way to try out the new technology .
In order that " no e@@ x@@ tra liability risk will be im@@ posed " on drivers , the government wants to " e@@ x@@ am@@ ine and , where necessary , adap@@ t " legal par@@ am@@ e@@ ters to the new developments .
Germany wants to agree on international provisions for the speed limit for dri@@ v@@ er@@ less cars to be raised from 10 to 1@@ 30 k@@ il@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ ters per hour .
The German government also wants to reach an agreement on changes to the V@@ i@@ en@@ n@@ a Con@@ ven@@ ti@@ on , which to date only provides for human beings as drivers .
With a@@ u@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ at@@ i@@ c driving the car increasingly takes control and the driver becomes more and more the p@@ as@@ sen@@ ger .
The technology is primarily based on sen@@ s@@ ors and cameras which c@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ ure the environment and process data in se@@ con@@ ds .
According to a study sub@@ mit@@ ted by the Ministry of the En@@ v@@ ir@@ on@@ ment , highly a@@ u@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ ated driving will be te@@ ch@@ n@@ ically possible on motor@@ ways by 20@@ 20 .
However dri@@ v@@ er@@ less vehicles " are not an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ated until 20@@ 20 " on public roads .
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly a@@ u@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ ated driving f@@ un@@ c@@ tions in Germany will be around € 8@@ .@@ 4 billion for 20@@ 25 .
" D@@ ig@@ it@@ al net@@ working of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , " says S@@ P@@ D tr@@ an@@ sport politician S@@ ö@@ r@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l .
However the issue of liability for ac@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent@@ s and the security of drivers ' per@@ s@@ on@@ al data must be conc@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ ely c@@ l@@ ar@@ i@@ fied .
And Germans still view dri@@ v@@ er@@ less cars sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ally - much more than the French or Americans .
A s@@ ur@@ v@@ ey by the For@@ s@@ a Institute com@@ mis@@ si@@ on@@ ed by the testing or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation De@@ k@@ ra , presented to the I@@ A@@ A on Wednesday , conc@@ lu@@ des that only eight percent of Germans believe that a@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ o@@ m@@ ously dri@@ v@@ en vehicles will cat@@ ch on in the coming 10 years , 3@@ 2 percent estimate it will take 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it will happen at all .
In France 21 percent of those asked expect to see a@@ u@@ t@@ on@@ o@@ m@@ ously dri@@ v@@ en cars by 20@@ 25 and in the USA 33 percent .
An@@ y@@ way drivers in Germany are not yet read@@ y to re@@ ly on a com@@ p@@ le@@ t@@ ely self dri@@ v@@ en car .
According to a s@@ ur@@ v@@ ey by the di@@ g@@ it@@ al association B@@ it@@ k@@ o@@ m , only seven percent agree that control should be h@@ an@@ d@@ ed over to the car during the en@@ ti@@ re journey on all roads .
Ne@@ v@@ er@@ th@@ el@@ ess , 15 percent could im@@ ag@@ ine this happening on motor@@ ways in fre@@ e-@@ f@@ lo@@ w@@ ing traffic and 45 percent in traffic j@@ am@@ s .
Approximately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances .
B@@ ol@@ l not to play in team and doubles in European Championship
As things st@@ and , the D@@ us@@ s@@ el@@ d@@ or@@ f player plans to play only in the s@@ in@@ g@@ l@@ es in the competition , running from 25 September to 4 October .
The final decision will be made on 22 September .
" It is a major loss for our team . "
" The l@@ ads heard about it this morning . "
" But we are strong enough to p@@ ick up the title without Tim@@ o , " said national coach J@@ ö@@ r@@ g Ro@@ s@@ sk@@ op@@ f during European Championship training in D@@ us@@ s@@ el@@ d@@ or@@ f .
At this time B@@ ol@@ l was on a flight to a long ar@@ r@@ an@@ ged a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ t@@ ment with sp@@ on@@ s@@ ors in China .
The 3@@ 4@@ -year-old German ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion is expected back on Friday .
" Without Tim@@ o we have the di@@ sa@@ d@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age of no longer being the clear f@@ a@@ vo@@ ur@@ it@@ es , " de@@ c@@ la@@ red in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al European ch@@ am@@ p@@ ion D@@ im@@ it@@ ri@@ j O@@ v@@ char@@ o@@ v .
But the Ham@@ el@@ in player , who is the top se@@ ed in E@@ k@@ at@@ er@@ in@@ bur@@ g , also re@@ members the European Championship in S@@ ch@@ w@@ e@@ ch@@ at in 20@@ 13 .
" We didn 't have Tim@@ o then either , and we still became European Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s . "
" That is what we need to focus on , " de@@ c@@ la@@ red the world number five .
The English football national player L@@ u@@ k@@ e Shaw , of M@@ an@@ ch@@ e@@ st@@ er , United has sustain@@ ed a severe injury to his right leg .
In the course of the tackle in the Ch@@ am@@ p@@ i@@ on@@ s League game with P@@ S@@ V E@@ in@@ d@@ h@@ o@@ v@@ en , the def@@ en@@ der was hit by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Moreno and after a long b@@ out of treatment was re@@ plac@@ ed .
In@@ it@@ i@@ al di@@ ag@@ n@@ o@@ sis in@@ di@@ c@@ at@@ es that the 20@@ -year-old who used to play with B@@ ast@@ ian S@@ ch@@ w@@ ein@@ st@@ e@@ i@@ ger has broken his ti@@ b@@ ia .
G@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ tier fe@@ els too old to be an en@@ f@@ ant ter@@ ri@@ ble
It is a m@@ i@@ x@@ t@@ ure of a huge fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ works ch@@ am@@ b@@ er of h@@ or@@ r@@ ors : des@@ ig@@ ner J@@ e@@ an Paul G@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ tier ( 6@@ 3 ) presented an exhibition of his work in M@@ un@@ i@@ ch on Wednesday .
The highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which look al@@ ar@@ m@@ ingly human th@@ an@@ ks to video projection .
They wear the French des@@ ig@@ ner 's spec@@ t@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar c@@ re@@ ations , which among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ on@@ n@@ a 's stage outfits - and also put men in sk@@ ir@@ ts .
" These days I can 't say I 'm the en@@ f@@ ant ter@@ ri@@ ble of hau@@ te c@@ out@@ ure any longer , because I have white hair . "
" It used to be ble@@ a@@ ch@@ ed , n@@ o@@ w@@ ad@@ ay@@ s it 's real , " says G@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ tier .
For visitors to the exhibition , " From the S@@ i@@ de@@ walk to the C@@ at@@ walk , " which can be seen in the K@@ un@@ s@@ th@@ alle at the H@@ y@@ p@@ o Cul@@ t@@ ure Foundation from 1 September , it is f@@ or@@ t@@ un@@ ate that the fashion des@@ ig@@ ner has changed his initially re@@ lu@@ c@@ t@@ ant attitude to a show about his own char@@ ac@@ ter .
O@@ ri@@ g@@ in@@ ally he was against it because , " For me an exhibition so@@ unded a bit like death , " he said .
When you die , you get put into a museum .
This re@@ m@@ ar@@ k@@ able collection has already been st@@ ag@@ ed in Mon@@ tre@@ al , Canada , and in Paris .
It 's about a lot more than beautiful clothes , " says the director of the K@@ un@@ s@@ th@@ alle , Ro@@ ger D@@ i@@ e@@ der@@ en .
It is about t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , ac@@ c@@ ep@@ t@@ ance and the vision of an open society .
The e@@ x@@ h@@ ib@@ its provide an in@@ si@@ g@@ h@@ t into the hard to over@@ look work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education .
The show is not con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ted ch@@ ron@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ically , but it is a b@@ r@@ illi@@ an@@ t@@ ly ch@@ o@@ re@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ ph@@ ed complete work of art which has involved a great deal of effort : for example a sty@@ list has been engaged especially to look after the man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins ' hair .
According to cur@@ ator Th@@ i@@ er@@ r@@ y-@@ Ma@@ xim@@ e L@@ ori@@ o@@ t , the c@@ re@@ at@@ ors car@@ ted 14 t@@ on@@ n@@ es of material to M@@ un@@ i@@ ch .
Sh@@ or@@ t@@ ly before the start of Ok@@ to@@ b@@ er@@ f@@ est there was also a special tre@@ at in store : a Le@@ der@@ h@@ o@@ sen out@@ fit with a cor@@ set .
H@@ e@@ i@@ d@@ i m@@ e@@ ets Mad@@ on@@ n@@ a
He has always been interested in strong women ( " W@@ o@@ m@@ en are c@@ le@@ v@@ er@@ er than men " ) and in people who are a little different , says G@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ tier .
Even G@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ tier 's old te@@ d@@ dy is on show in the exhibition .
He represents the des@@ ig@@ ner 's first , t@@ ent@@ ative steps at fashion .
As a child ( he was not a good p@@ u@@ p@@ il and he was bad at football ) , he d@@ re@@ s@@ s@@ ed his te@@ d@@ dy in b@@ r@@ as and dresses .
His parents did not al@@ low him to play with dolls .
L@@ ater he taught himself fashion des@@ ig@@ n .
He st@@ ol@@ e fashion magazines and sc@@ r@@ ut@@ in@@ ised other des@@ ign@@ ers ' c@@ re@@ ations , G@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ tier told us in M@@ un@@ i@@ ch .
Of course , later I bought them .
He was not able to pay the mo@@ d@@ el@@ s for his first fashion show .
They got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
Dec@@ or@@ ation instead of cur@@ ta@@ ins - P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace as a fashion n@@ ich@@ e
There used to be long em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y machines in and around P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en making many m@@ e@@ t@@ res
of em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ ed f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ s and l@@ ac@@ es in v@@ ast quantities for customers who made , for example , table c@@ lo@@ ths and cur@@ ta@@ ins .
This is no longer the case today , explains Andreas R@@ ein@@ har@@ d@@ t , man@@ ag@@ ing director of Mo@@ des@@ p@@ it@@ z@@ e P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en .
In@@ st@@ e@@ ad , fashion is once more important .
In the early days of P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace , fashion played a large role , then it was re@@ plac@@ ed by the home te@@ x@@ t@@ ile industry - and now it is being re@@ discovered as a n@@ ich@@ e .
R@@ ein@@ har@@ d@@ t gave a few e@@ x@@ am@@ pl@@ es : l@@ ace in de@@ c@@ or@@ ation , for accessories such as b@@ ags and for traditional co@@ st@@ um@@ es .
Gen@@ er@@ ally , so@@ -@@ called v@@ in@@ t@@ age fashion , based on style er@@ as from the past , is p@@ ro@@ du@@ c@@ ing an increasing potential for orders .
An@@ y@@ one in the te@@ x@@ t@@ ile industry in Germany who cannot serve a n@@ ich@@ e is no longer in the market .
We are already getting half of all our con@@ tr@@ acts this way .
Mo@@ des@@ p@@ it@@ z@@ e P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en , together with nine other b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es , is a member of the P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en@@ er Sp@@ it@@ z@@ e un@@ d S@@ ti@@ ck@@ er@@ e@@ i@@ en trade association .
Only they are allowed to be@@ ar the p@@ ro@@ te@@ c@@ ted la@@ be@@ l .
Sales have f@@ all@@ en by around 80 percent over the last 15 years .
There are now har@@ d@@ ly any private spec@@ i@@ ality shops or w@@ h@@ ol@@ es@@ al@@ ers .
Our products har@@ d@@ ly reach the customers over these ch@@ ann@@ els .
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ay@@ s m@@ ass produced g@@ oo@@ ds are man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tu@@ red much more ch@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ ly in the Asian region and sold almost e@@ x@@ c@@ lu@@ si@@ v@@ ely through chains .
Furthermore e@@ x@@ p@@ or@@ ts to Russia and the USA are currently w@@ e@@ ak@@ en@@ ing slightly .
This is enough reason for new directions .
The trade association is also trying to score with environmental con@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ n@@ ess , as C@@ or@@ d@@ el@@ ia B@@ a@@ u@@ er of S@@ ti@@ ck@@ per@@ le in F@@ al@@ ken@@ stein explains . " As of this year we have implemented a se@@ al of quality which shows that our production is ec@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ically and socially com@@ p@@ at@@ i@@ ble .
R@@ ein@@ har@@ d@@ t added , " This also app@@ li@@ es to the materials we use . "
Q@@ u@@ al@@ i@@ fied des@@ ig@@ ner U@@ te S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t te@@ a@@ ch@@ es in the f@@ ac@@ ul@@ ty for app@@ li@@ ed arts at the S@@ ch@@ ne@@ e@@ berg b@@ r@@ an@@ ch of the West S@@ a@@ x@@ ony University of Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au and spec@@ i@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ es in em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y and l@@ ace .
In order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high@@ -@@ quality and in@@ n@@ o@@ v@@ ative products .
That takes time and cour@@ age .
There is a field of tension between the des@@ ign@@ ers ' new@@ est i@@ de@@ as and b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es , who must think primarily in commercial terms , " says S@@ ch@@ mid@@ t .
This is why e@@ x@@ i@@ st@@ ing des@@ ig@@ n@@ s are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers .
A few years ago te@@ x@@ t@@ ile des@@ ig@@ ner K@@ at@@ i Re@@ u@@ ter re@@ vit@@ al@@ i@@ s@@ ed the historic s@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ ball l@@ ace .
The machines em@@ bro@@ i@@ der small be@@ ads in s@@ el@@ ec@@ ted plac@@ es .
P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en m@@ a@@ ster g@@ ol@@ d@@ s@@ m@@ it@@ h Bi@@ anc@@ a H@@ al@@ le@@ b@@ a@@ ch@@ -@@ K@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ ß@@ e was inspired by this . " In the past I had no use for traditional P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace . "
Now she us@@ es the s@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ ball l@@ ace for her je@@ w@@ ell@@ er@@ y .
U@@ sing an elaborate process she em@@ bo@@ s@@ s@@ es the p@@ at@@ ter@@ n in s@@ il@@ ver .
" Many people in the region identify themselves with P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace - young and old , " says Re@@ u@@ ter .
She also deli@@ v@@ er@@ s to the USA , Au@@ str@@ al@@ i@@ a and Fin@@ land - primarily to customers whose fore@@ f@@ a@@ thers lived in P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en and the s@@ ur@@ ro@@ unding area and who want to have a m@@ em@@ en@@ to .
So with my je@@ w@@ ell@@ er@@ y I see myself as a modern am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace .
Dis@@ ne@@ y plans new " Mary P@@ op@@ p@@ ins " film
You sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n 't inter@@ f@@ er@@ e with le@@ gen@@ ds , but Dis@@ ne@@ y is d@@ ar@@ ing to make a new film of the classic " Mary P@@ op@@ p@@ ins " anyway .
But according to " En@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ment We@@ e@@ k@@ ly " it is not going to be a re@@ make but a sort of sequ@@ el , set 20 years after the first film with the mag@@ ical n@@ ann@@ y .
It is about the n@@ ann@@ y 's e@@ x@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ ces with the Ban@@ ks family in the time of the Great De@@ pre@@ s@@ si@@ on in England .
Who is going to take the role of Mary P@@ op@@ p@@ ins , played 50 years ago by Julie Andrews , is not yet certain .

X@@ i ur@@ g@@ es to open economy wi@@ der to world
The economy must open wi@@ der to the outside world to f@@ u@@ el growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ing told a group t@@ asked with steering reform on Tuesday .
" China should be committed to at@@ trac@@ ting foreign investment and e@@ x@@ per@@ t@@ ise , and improve op@@ en@@ in@@ g@@ -@@ up po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es , " he said , ad@@ d@@ re@@ s@@ sing the 16th Me@@ e@@ t@@ ing of the Centr@@ al Le@@ ad@@ ing Group for Deep@@ en@@ ing O@@ v@@ er@@ all Re@@ form .
Pro@@ mo@@ ting opening up while p@@ ush@@ ing forward re@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ s will add new im@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ us and vit@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , X@@ i said .
The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list re@@ g@@ ul@@ ating market access , re@@ la@@ x@@ ation of bor@@ der-@@ control po@@ li@@ c@@ i@@ es , encouraging st@@ at@@ e-@@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to ab@@ sor@@ b private capital and over@@ hau@@ ling the re@@ si@@ dent re@@ g@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ation system .
According to the statement , a negative list , i@@ den@@ ti@@ fying se@@ c@@ tors and b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es that are off@@ -@@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
The system will be g@@ r@@ a@@ du@@ ally tested and improved through trial programs .
The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in al@@ lo@@ c@@ ating resources , en@@ s@@ ur@@ ing a law@@ -based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
The government will also loo@@ sen controls on the powers it d@@ el@@ eg@@ at@@ es to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ es .
The statement also said China will al@@ low border areas to e@@ x@@ pl@@ or@@ e new mo@@ d@@ el@@ s of cross-@@ border economic cooperation and new m@@ e@@ ch@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ms for promoting regional growth .
In a bid to open up st@@ at@@ e-@@ con@@ tro@@ l@@ led se@@ c@@ tors , more areas will be open to private investment .
" The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the law@@ ful interests of fore@@ ign@@ -@@ f@@ un@@ ded companies and provide better services for them , " said the statement .
In addition , it will be made e@@ a@@ si@@ er for fore@@ ign@@ ers to apply for per@@ man@@ ent re@@ si@@ den@@ ce per@@ m@@ its , or " g@@ re@@ en card , " by optim@@ izing requirements and stre@@ am@@ l@@ in@@ ing the app@@ lic@@ ation process .
Guar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ ing lawyers ' right to practice and n@@ ur@@ tur@@ ing professional j@@ ud@@ g@@ es and prosecutors were also di@@ sc@@ us@@ s@@ ed at a meeting .
The meeting was also attended by Prem@@ ier L@@ i K@@ e@@ q@@ iang , and senior leaders Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ h@@ an@@ g Ga@@ ol@@ i , according to a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double the mer@@ cur@@ y limit in pre@@ dat@@ or@@ y fish
The EU commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cur@@ y in large pre@@ dat@@ or@@ y fish and consumers therefore can expect a si@@ gn@@ ific@@ an@@ t@@ ly higher do@@ se of this ne@@ u@@ ro@@ to@@ x@@ in .
The consumer or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ s@@ ation F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , to which an EU working p@@ a@@ p@@ er on the subject was made available , is heavily c@@ r@@ it@@ ical of the plans . " R@@ i@@ s@@ ks and side effects of in@@ appro@@ pri@@ ate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pre@@ gn@@ ant women and small children , " de@@ c@@ la@@ red M@@ at@@ th@@ i@@ as W@@ ol@@ f@@ s@@ ch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch .
According to W@@ ol@@ f@@ s@@ ch@@ mid@@ t , the limits for the ne@@ u@@ ro@@ to@@ x@@ in for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example sh@@ ar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 m@@ g of mer@@ cur@@ y per k@@ il@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ m of fish for " economic re@@ as@@ on@@ s . "
Large pre@@ dat@@ or@@ y fish however are today so heavily contaminated with mer@@ cur@@ y that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of catches may not be sold .
Once the limit has been doubled , however , only 1@@ 4@@ .@@ 5 percent would be un@@ s@@ al@@ e@@ able .
In return for this re@@ la@@ x@@ ation the EU , according to F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch , wants to ti@@ gh@@ ten the limits for other fish from the current 0.@@ 5 m@@ g to 0.@@ 1 m@@ g of mer@@ cur@@ y per k@@ il@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ m .
But F@@ oo@@ d@@ watch des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ es this as a " tri@@ ck , " because s@@ m@@ aller prey fish , such as for example car@@ p , generally have so little con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ation that these planned m@@ a@@ xim@@ um levels are already com@@ p@@ li@@ ed with today .
The re@@ du@@ c@@ ti@@ on for small fish therefore is " a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ou@@ s di@@ v@@ er@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ y t@@ ac@@ tic which helps only the economy , " de@@ c@@ la@@ res W@@ ol@@ f@@ s@@ ch@@ mid@@ t .
Mercury is for human beings a highly to@@ x@@ ic heavy metal which ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ at@@ es largely in the food chain , above all in pre@@ dat@@ or@@ y fish .
For this reason the German government has issued a warning that " even low levels , particularly in un@@ bor@@ n children , can lead to damage to the nervous system . "
The German En@@ v@@ ir@@ on@@ ment Minister , however , de@@ c@@ la@@ red on his home p@@ age with re@@ g@@ ar@@ d to the current m@@ a@@ xim@@ um levels that a " health risk to the general population " is not an@@ ti@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ated .
Mercury is released into the environment primarily through the bur@@ n@@ ing of coal .
German coal plants , according to w@@ r@@ it@@ ten information from the German Ministry of the En@@ v@@ ir@@ on@@ ment to Green B@@ un@@ de@@ st@@ a@@ g member An@@ n@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck , di@@ s@@ ch@@ ar@@ ge more than six t@@ on@@ n@@ es of mer@@ cur@@ y per year , two th@@ ir@@ ds of the to@@ t@@ al amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
The con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ation of mer@@ cur@@ y in fish , for example in the El@@ be , Rh@@ ine and Dan@@ u@@ be , is " e@@ x@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely e@@ x@@ c@@ e@@ e@@ ded on a long-term b@@ a@@ si@@ s , " the " Sp@@ i@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ l " newspaper quoted from the p@@ a@@ p@@ er in March .
In the past year , E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe@@ -@@ wide al@@ er@@ ts on mer@@ cur@@ y in fish r@@ ated among the most fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ F@@ F .
