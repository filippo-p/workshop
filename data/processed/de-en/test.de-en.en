Obama receives Net@@ any@@ a@@ h@@ u
The relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ a@@ h@@ u is not exactly friendly .
The two wanted to talk about the imple@@ ment@@ ation of the international agreement and about T@@ e@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ an 's destabil@@ ising activities in the Middle East .
The meeting was also planned to cover the conflict with the Palestinians and the disputed two state solution .
Relations between Obama and Net@@ any@@ a@@ h@@ u have been strained for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the continuous building of sett@@ l@@ e@@ ments in Israel and accuses Net@@ any@@ a@@ h@@ u of a lack of initiative in the peace process .
The relationship between the two has further deterior@@ ated because of the deal that Obama negotiated on Iran 's atomic programme , .
In March , at the invitation of the Republicans , Net@@ any@@ a@@ h@@ u made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an a@@ f@@ f@@ ron@@ t to Obama .
The speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time impending in Israel .
In 911 Call , Professor Ad@@ m@@ its to Sh@@ o@@ o@@ ting Gir@@ lfriend
In a 911 call , his voice only slightly sha@@ ky , college professor Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b told police he had shot his girlfriend and officers needed to get over to their house .
Lam@@ b made a point to say his " sweet dog " was there alive and probably upset , and said the dead woman 's family contacts could be found on her phone .
Inside the home , officers found Amy P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss ' body and a hand-@@ written note s@@ c@@ r@@ i@@ b@@ b@@ l@@ ed on a white legal pad : " I am so very sorry I wish I could take it back I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me , " read the letter authorities say was signed by Lam@@ b .
There was no indication that Lam@@ b , who was teaching two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school 's campus , where police believe he shot and killed a well-@@ liked history professor , Ethan S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t , in the d@@ o@@ o@@ r@@ way to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lynn Bu@@ ford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10 : 18 a.m .
He said Lam@@ b made the fat@@ eful 911 call some@@ time after that .
By the end of the day , there would be one more death : Lam@@ b took his own life as police closed in on him .
A day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors , authorities were still trying to piece together what motivated Lam@@ b .
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state as well as students and staff who knew him helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher .
Students said they looked forward to his class .
Police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t himself had included Lam@@ b in a book he wrote where he acknowledged the " wonderful people " he shared his academic life with .
Both taught in the Division of Social Sci@@ ences and History , which lists 17 faculty members , and many students took courses from both .
At the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations of problems .
A student who praised Lam@@ b , Brandon B@@ e@@ a@@ vers , said he also seemed agitated and jit@@ tery , " like there was something wrong with him . "
Another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said Lam@@ b told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 20@@ 14-@@ 15 academic year .
Lam@@ b had earlier asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence , saying he had a health issue of some sort .
This year , he was only teaching two online classes .
Rec@@ ent changes in the university 's hiring policies meant that the doc@@ tor@@ ate Lam@@ b had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic tenure track to become an assistant professor .
University President William La@@ Forge said he didn 't know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t but " obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b 's mind . "
Those are questions Lam@@ b can no longer answer .
After fleeing the campus , police later picked up Lam@@ b 's trail when he crossed back into Mississippi from Arkansas .
Before he could be appre@@ hended , Lam@@ b killed himself with a single .@@ 38-@@ cali@@ ber pistol in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parents ' home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ o@@ n@@ er M@@ e@@ t@@ h@@ el Johnson .
His car was still running in the driveway .
It was not immediately clear why Lam@@ b went to that home , though Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lam@@ b grew up in the area .
Lam@@ b started working at the university , which has 3@@ ,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,000 , in 2009 and taught geograph@@ y and education classes .
He received a doc@@ tor@@ ate in education in the spring .
One of Lam@@ b 's longtime friends described him as smart , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ s@@ t@@ on said she was 15 and Lam@@ b was 20 when they met through mut@@ ual friends .
She and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play guitar .
He was quite the heart@@ thro@@ b back then .
All the girls would melt when he was around , " said H@@ air@@ s@@ t@@ on , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brandon .
Lam@@ b and P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss had apparently been dating for some time .
In the 911 call , Lam@@ b said " I killed my wife , " but there was no record of them ever mar@@ rying .
They had a dog named Ligh@@ t@@ ning that lived with them at the bri@@ ck house that backs up to a b@@ a@@ y@@ ou in Gau@@ tier .
Police said the dog was OK .
P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss ' ex-@@ husband , Shawn O '@@ Ste@@ en , said they divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who 's now 19 .
" She was completely devastated , " O '@@ Ste@@ en said of his daughter .
She and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O '@@ Ste@@ en said he had not met Lam@@ b but heard through his daughter A@@ b@@ i@@ g@@ ail that Lam@@ b was interested in music and played the blu@@ es .
Lam@@ b met P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss when he and A@@ b@@ i@@ g@@ ail both performed at a summer fair three years ago .
Later , they played together in the oc@@ c@@ asi@@ onal gig .
O '@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ l@@ e@@ p Room , a d@@ i@@ m@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he last saw Lam@@ b and P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss the night of Sept . 5 , after Lam@@ b had finished playing his guitar and harmon@@ ica for a spar@@ se crowd .
There was no sign of anything a@@ m@@ iss .
" Just a happy couple , " he said .
We were cutting up and throwing one-@@ liners at each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of wit about them .
S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t , the slain professor , directed the first-@@ year seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at the school .
He was married and had three young children .
He studied at Em@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ ia State University in Kansas and was president of his fratern@@ ity and student government .
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night , about 900 people , including faculty members , staff , students , and members of the community , attended a c@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ l@@ e@@ l@@ ight memorial .
S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t 's wife , Li@@ z , and brother Jeff S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t also attended the vigil , during which the university choir sang " Bright Morning Star " and " A@@ m@@ a@@ zing Grace . "
Cl@@ asses resume Wednesday .
" We 're trying to get our students to come back , " La@@ Forge said .
The crisis is over .
This is a day of healing .
Amy and R@@ o@@ g@@ e@@ l@@ io So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press writers Emily W@@ a@@ g@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and R@@ e@@ b@@ e@@ c@@ c@@ a Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
This story has been cor@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ ted to reflect that police are now saying Lam@@ b made the 911 call after shooting S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t , and that while Lam@@ b referred to P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss as his wife in the 911 call , there is no indication the two ever married .
Toys R Us Plans to H@@ ire Fewer Holiday Season Workers
Toys R Us says it won 't hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year , but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seas@@ onal workers a chance to work more hours .
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at stores and distribution centers around the country , down from the 45@@ ,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season .
Most of the jobs will be part-time .
The company said it will start i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ viewing applicants this month , with staff levels rising from October through December .
While the holidays themselves are months away , holiday shopping season is drawing closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to help them staff stores and sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox Jok@@ es About His ' Date ' With Princess Diana
The premiere of " Back to the Future " was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox profession@@ ally .
It was n@@ o@@ t@@ e@@ worthy because of personal reasons , too .
" We were sitting in the theater waiting for the r@@ o@@ y@@ als to come in and I realize that the seat next to me is emp@@ ty , and it d@@ a@@ w@@ ns on me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me , " he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary , " Back in Time . "

UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia 's stepped up military support for Syria is that " there is no military solution " to the nearly five-@@ year conflict and more weapons will only w@@ o@@ r@@ sen the violence and misery for millions of people .
The U.N. chief again urged all parties , including the divided U.N. Security Council , to u@@ n@@ ite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent council nations - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly 's ministerial session later this month to discuss Syria .
He expressed regret that divisions in the council and among the Syrian people and regional powers " made this situation unsol@@ vable . "
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the soli@@ d@@ a@@ r@@ ity and unity they did in achieving an Iran nuclear deal in addressing the Syria crisis .
8 Poll Numbers That Show Donald Tr@@ ump Is For Real
Some have tried to label him a fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ pper .
Others have dismissed him as a jo@@ ke .
And some are holding out for an imp@@ l@@ o@@ sion .
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to drag Donald Tr@@ ump down from atop the polls , it hasn 't worked ( yet ) .
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Tr@@ ump 's lead at double dig@@ its , and some are starting to ask seriously what it means for the real estate m@@ o@@ g@@ u@@ l 's nomination chances .
Of course , it 's still early in the election cycle .
None of this is to say that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republican nomination .
P@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ its point out that at this time in 2011 , Rick Perry 's lead was giving way to a rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , neither of whom won even one state in the nomination process .
And there are many reasons he would struggle in a general election .
But outside groups like Je@@ b Bush 's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Grow@@ th are recogn@@ izing Tr@@ ump 's staying power and beginning to u@@ n@@ load their dollars to topp@@ le him .
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate m@@ o@@ g@@ u@@ l isn 't just a passing phase :
Tr@@ ump 's fav@@ o@@ r@@ ability ratings have turned 180 degrees .
Right before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candidacy in mid-@@ June , a M@@ o@@ n@@ mouth University poll showed only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate m@@ o@@ g@@ u@@ l .
By mid-@@ July , it was 40 percent .
In early August , it was 52 percent .
Now , six in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
Rou@@ g@@ h@@ ly three in 10 say they have a negative view .
And these numbers hold up in early states .
A Q@@ u@@ inn@@ ip@@ i@@ ac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there had a favorable view of Tr@@ ump .
Two-@@ thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as the nominee .
In a CNN / OR@@ C poll last week , 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either " enthusiastic " or " satis@@ fied " if Tr@@ ump were the nominee .
Only two in 10 say they would be " upset " if he were the nominee .
Only Ben Car@@ son gener@@ ates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be " enthusiastic " vs. 40 percent who say the same of Tr@@ ump ) .
The next closest in enthusiasm ?
Marco Rub@@ io with only 21 percent .
On the fli@@ p side , 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be " dissatisfied " or " upset " if establishment favorite Je@@ b Bush becomes the nominee .
A majority of Republicans don 't see Tr@@ ump 's t@@ e@@ m@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ a@@ m@@ ent as a problem .
While Donald Tr@@ ump has been widely criticized for his b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ast and insul@@ ts , 52 percent of l@@ e@@ a@@ n@@ ed Republican voters nationwide think that the real estate m@@ o@@ g@@ u@@ l has the right t@@ e@@ m@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ a@@ m@@ ent to be president , according to Monday 's ABC News / Washington Post poll .
The same number holds in the first-@@ in-@@ the-@@ nation cau@@ cus state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be commander in chief , according to Q@@ u@@ inn@@ ip@@ i@@ ac last week .
Still , 44 percent think he doesn 't have the personality to serve effectively , and almost six in 10 independents say his t@@ e@@ m@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ a@@ m@@ ent does not belong in the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republican voters are getting used to the idea .
When they put on their pun@@ dit hats , Republican voters think Tr@@ ump is for real .
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination , four in 10 said Tr@@ ump was the best bet , according to a CNN / OR@@ C poll out last week .
That 's a change from when four in 10 placed their money on Je@@ b Bush in late July .
Full disclosure : GOP voters haven 't had the cle@@ arest cr@@ yst@@ al ball in the past .
At this time last cycle , four in 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry to win the nomination , vs. only 28 percent for eventual nominee Mitt Romney .
Still , it shows that a p@@ l@@ u@@ r@@ ality of GOP voters see Tr@@ ump 's campaign as plausible .
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still b@@ e@@ ats almost everyone .
Some pund@@ its point out that the spl@@ intered field is likely contributing to Tr@@ ump 's lead , while anti@@ -T@@ rum@@ p support is be spread d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ u@@ s@@ ely among more than a dozen other candidates .
But a M@@ o@@ n@@ mouth University poll in early September shows that , in a hy@@ pothe@@ tical head-to-@@ head m@@ a@@ t@@ c@@ h@@ up between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican candidates , Tr@@ ump almost always gar@@ ners majority support .
He leads Car@@ ly F@@ i@@ o@@ r@@ ina by 13 points , Marco Rub@@ io by 14 points , Walker by 15 points , Je@@ b Bush by 19 points , and , finally , Rand Paul , John Ka@@ s@@ i@@ ch and Chris C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ie by 33 points each .
He 's in a dead heat with Ted Cruz .
The only candidate who b@@ e@@ ats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the business@@ man by a wide 19 points in a hy@@ pothe@@ tical head-to-@@ head .
A bare majority of Donald Tr@@ ump 's supporters say they 've made up their minds .
A new CBS / NY@@ T poll out on Tuesday shows that just more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have locked in their votes .
Obviously , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say they would never change their mind .
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to swit@@ ching candidates .
Still , Tr@@ ump 's stron@@ gest competition at the moment is from fellow out@@ sider neu@@ r@@ o@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made up their minds are twice as likely to go for Tr@@ ump .
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
Even since Donald Tr@@ ump called immigrants from Mexico " rap@@ ists " in his campaign announcement speech two months ago , immigration has been front and center in the 20@@ 16 conversation .
Some are worried that Tr@@ ump 's b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ast will drive crucial Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts .
But according to Monday 's new ABC / Post poll , six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems Donald Tr@@ ump will remain too .
Fru@@ stration with government is climbing to new highs .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now account for roughly half of the support from Republican voters , largely due to their out@@ sider status .
Six in 10 Republicans in Monday 's new ABC / Post poll say they want a political out@@ sider over someone with government experience .
And they are angry at Washington , too .
A Des Moines Reg@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ er / Bloomberg poll in Iowa from two weeks ago shows that three in four Iowa Republicans are fru@@ strated with Republicans in Congress , with 54 percent " u@@ n@@ satis@@ fied " and 21 percent " mad as hell . "
Mun@@ ich , Sy@@ l@@ t und Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive residential developments are located here in H@@ o@@ b@@ o@@ o@@ ken@@ w@@ e@@ g - with a view over the North Sea mud@@ flat@@ s .
On this road one square met@@ re of a t@@ h@@ a@@ t@@ ched house costs an average of € 7@@ 3@@ ,@@ 300 .
" On Sy@@ l@@ t , the number of properties on offer is natur@@ ally limited , " says a study - hence the high prices .
This new study indic@@ ates the particular locations with the most expensive accommod@@ ation per square met@@ re .
Of course , € 18.@@ 70 per square met@@ re for student dig@@ s in Mun@@ ich is not really low .
C@@ o@@ m@@ pared with Germany 's top areas , however , this price seems likes p@@ e@@ a@@ n@@ u@@ t@@ s .
Property service E@@ n@@ gel & Vol@@ k@@ ers has published a league table of the most exclusive residential areas in Germany - with stag@@ g@@ e@@ r@@ ingly high prices per square met@@ re .
More than € 10,000 is nothing there - per q@@ u@@ are met@@ re , mind you .
O@@ k , if you can 't afford it ...
I@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ dent@@ ally , for once Mun@@ ich is not in the lead .
Champions League : Bay@@ ern off to a dream start thanks to M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler and G@@ ö@@ t@@ z@@ e
Dou@@ ble goal s@@ c@@ o@@ r@@ er in Pi@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us : Bay@@ ern star Thomas M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler is simply on a roll .
A lucky goal from Thomas M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler p@@ a@@ v@@ ed the way for a 3 : 0 victory for FC Bay@@ ern at Ol@@ yp@@ i@@ a@@ c@@ os Pi@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us - then it got better .
A confident start to the Champions League season .
World champions Thomas M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler and Mario G@@ ö@@ t@@ z@@ e brought about a dream start to their " Milan Mission " in the see@@ thing cau@@ l@@ d@@ r@@ on at P@@ i@@ r@@ e@@ aus .
Tra@@ i@@ n@@ er Pe@@ p Guar@@ d@@ i@@ ola 's team won their opening match in the Champions League in a hot atmosphere away to the Greek record holders , thanks to M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler 's bra@@ ce ( 52nd and 90@@ th minutes + 2 ) and G@@ ö@@ t@@ z@@ e 's goal ( 89@@ th minute ) , ending in a score of 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
The t@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ f@@ th successful start in a row should be the first step toward the final in Italy on 28 May 20@@ 16 , where Guar@@ d@@ i@@ ola wants to end his third attempt by taking the trophy back to Mun@@ ich .
With his 28@@ th goal in the Champions League , M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler took Bay@@ ern into the lead with the g@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ i@@ ous help of Ol@@ y@@ mi@@ a@@ c@@ os g@@ o@@ a@@ l@@ ie Roberto , who let through a cross shot from the world champion .
" We aren 't going to under@@ estimate them , " promised Bay@@ ern captain Philli@@ p@@ p Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ a@@ k@@ is Stadium in front of 3@@ 1@@ ,@@ 68@@ 8 hot-@@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Mun@@ ich player kept his word .
They demonstrated a concentrated and committed performance without being show@@ y .
Pi@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us had won their six most recent premiere class home games , including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ e@@ t@@ i@@ co Madrid and Juventus Tur@@ in .
In 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dor@@ t@@ m@@ und stumbled here too .
But Bay@@ ern , u@@ n@@ defeated in seven Eu@@ rop@@ a Cup duels with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
They went to work bol@@ dly , but often too u@@ n@@ inspired in their offensive efforts .
Att@@ acks were too often initi@@ ated by bringing left winger Douglas Costa , who rarely got past former Brunswick player Omar El@@ a@@ b@@ d@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ a@@ o@@ u@@ i , into play .
M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler had more luck from the right when his cross shot from right field drove into the top left corner of the goal .
In the 67@@ th minute the world champion missed the chance of taking the match to 2 : 0 .
Robert L@@ e@@ w@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ w@@ ski had the best opportunities in the first half .
First when Olymp@@ i@@ a@@ c@@ os striker I@@ d@@ e@@ y@@ e Brown hit the Pole 's h@@ e@@ a@@ der from the line in the 26th minute .
Then with a shot which the g@@ o@@ a@@ l@@ ie p@@ a@@ r@@ ried with his knee in the 35@@ th minute .
Although Bay@@ ern is used to playing a dominant game , Pi@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us were able to needle them .
But they could count on g@@ o@@ a@@ l@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er .
For example when he ste@@ ered a shot from I@@ d@@ e@@ y@@ e over the cross@@ bar in the 56@@ th minute .
Guar@@ d@@ i@@ ola had a four-@@ man back@@ field defence deployed in front of Neu@@ er , with David Alba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome B@@ o@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ g .
Mario G@@ ö@@ t@@ z@@ e , back in the squad following mus@@ cle problems , initially sat on the sidelines .
The world cup hero had only been given the green light following final training , said Sporting Director Mat@@ thi@@ as Sam@@ mer on Sky : " If anyone wants to make something else out of that , they are being malicious . "
At the first change , Guar@@ d@@ i@@ ola decided against him , when he brought in Kingsley C@@ o@@ m@@ an for the s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ en L@@ e@@ w@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ w@@ ski in the 59@@ th minute .
G@@ ö@@ t@@ z@@ e came late for A@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ o Vidal in the 7@@ 6th minute and proved himself 13 minutes later ; M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler put another one in with a penalty .
Before the match there was a riot in the stadium .
After a small group of Bay@@ ern fans , some wearing masks , had apparently provoked supporters of hosts Pi@@ r@@ a@@ e@@ us from behind their fence with words and gest@@ ures , security forces attacked them and used bat@@ ons against the Mun@@ ich supporters .
At least one Bay@@ ern fan was taken injured from the stadium .
S@@ m@@ o@@ kers at a greater risk of losing teeth
S@@ m@@ o@@ kers damage not only their lungs but also their teeth , conclu@@ des a long-term study in P@@ o@@ t@@ s@@ dam .
The good news is : if you give up the risk decre@@ ases fast .
S@@ m@@ o@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
This emerges from a long-term study by an international team of researchers , including a number of employees of the German Institute for Nut@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ onal Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in P@@ o@@ t@@ s@@ dam .
C@@ o@@ m@@ pared to non-@@ smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their teeth premat@@ urely is between 2.5 and 3.@@ 6 times higher for smo@@ kers .
The scientists monitored more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
The main reasons for t@@ o@@ o@@ th loss are car@@ ies and inf@@ lam@@ mation of the g@@ ums , the DI@@ f@@ E states .
S@@ m@@ o@@ king is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , emph@@ a@@ s@@ ise the authors .
The connection between smoking and loss of teeth can therefore be attributed to more frequent gum inf@@ lam@@ mation in smo@@ kers .
It has not been clar@@ ified to what extent smoking raises the risk of car@@ ies .
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , the researchers write in the " Journal of Dental Research . "
It could however take 10 years before the danger once more drops to the level of non-@@ smo@@ kers ' , declared lead author Thomas Die@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ ch of the University of Birmingham in England .
People should be persuaded to become non-@@ smo@@ kers , declared study leader H@@ e@@ i@@ n@@ er Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : " S@@ m@@ o@@ king shor@@ tens the lif@@ esp@@ an . "
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and in our experience leads to good dental health to an advanced age .
In Germany over 20 percent of the population in the 65 to 74 age group are affected by t@@ o@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ lessness , according to the DI@@ f@@ E .
Earlier studies had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early t@@ o@@ o@@ th loss .
The new long term study substanti@@ ates these findings .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists discover ancient remains on the banks of the Rh@@ ine at Cologne
Arch@@ ae@@ ological finds have again been made on the right bank of the Rh@@ ine in Cologne .
Arch@@ ae@@ ologists from the Roman Ger@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ic Museum have unear@@ thed s@@ k@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ t@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the site where the new Rh@@ ine Boulevard is being construc@@ ted , said museum Director Marcus Tri@@ er on Tuesday .
Historians have been in search of so-called architectural m@@ o@@ n@@ u@@ m@@ ents since the start of construction work on the Rh@@ ine .
The museum , as the department for arch@@ ae@@ ological monument conservation , is always consulted when construction projects are carried out in the city district of Cologne .
The archaeologists made a find in the third construction phase of the Rh@@ ein Boulevard .
It is already known from text documents that a fort@@ ress stood on this spot in the 4th century , and in the 8@@ th century a church , explained Tri@@ er .
Besides the remains of the fort@@ ress and the church tow@@ er , a cem@@ etery with around 350 g@@ r@@ a@@ ves , which probably belon@@ ged to the church , has also been discovered .
Young woman hit by goods train
After a young woman met with an accident at the station in G@@ e@@ i@@ l@@ enk@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ -@@ Lin@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ n , police are asking for help from the general public .
Early on Wednesday morning , at about 1 : 40 a.m. , the young woman crossed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a goods train coming from the direction of M@@ ö@@ n@@ c@@ h@@ eng@@ lad@@ b@@ ach .
According to the Federal police she suffered severe injuries from the accident .
She was treated at the site by an emergency doctor and taken to hospital by ambulance .
Investig@@ ating officers have no idea why the young woman was crossing the tracks at night .
It is possible that the event was observed by witnesses or residents may have heard something .
This may apply to residents of or people passing by the Lin@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ n station , Z@@ i@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ l@@ b@@ ä@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ r@@ w@@ e@@ g , Thom@@ a@@ s@@ h@@ o@@ f@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ asse and Lei@@ f@@ f@@ a@@ r@@ ther S@@ t@@ ras@@ se ( L@@ 364 ) .

EU Commission p@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ es new court in controversy over TT@@ IP
To def@@ use the controversy over the planned Tran@@ sat@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership , TT@@ IP , the EU Commission has proposed a substantial reform of the current a@@ r@@ bit@@ ration system .
According to this , the disputed private a@@ r@@ bit@@ ration board for conflicts between corporations and countries would be replaced by a transparent system which cor@@ responds considerably more in its function to traditional courts .
" We want to set up a system which citizens trust , " stated the responsible EU Commissioner , Cec@@ ilia Mal@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ö@@ m , when intro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing it .
The Swe@@ de plans to intro@@ duce the proposal as the European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
The German government has announced its support .
The creation of TT@@ IP will result in the largest free trade zone in the world , covering 800 million people .
Plans for reform of the current a@@ r@@ bit@@ ration procedure specifically provide for the EU states and the USA to join@@ tly select independent judges for a new investment court .
They should come in equ@@ al p@@ r@@ o@@ portions from the EU , the USA and from non-@@ member countries .
For the first time , a second instance is also provided for .
This would allow for appeals to be made against jud@@ gements .
Up to now , the parties to proceedings have agreed on the a@@ r@@ bit@@ rator among themselves and there has been no possibility of appeal against their jud@@ gements .
In the discussions over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system to be fair and just , commented Mal@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ö@@ m .
In the long term , according to her statement , she wants to aim at an international investment court .
In this , for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be cleared up .
Invest@@ or State Dis@@ pute Sett@@ lement ( IS@@ DS ) , which is required particularly by large companies , is said to be one of the main reasons for the stiff opposition to the TT@@ IP in Europe .
Tra@@ d@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ onal a@@ r@@ bit@@ ration courts are criticised by adver@@ s@@ aries as a form of parallel justice through which companies are able to fight for compensation at the expense of tax payers , make national laws null and void , or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental protection standards .
In initial reactions , anti TT@@ IP organis@@ ations such as Cap@@ act called the EU Commission 's proposals i@@ n@@ adequate .
There was criticism in particular that they would not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
The German Secretary of State for the Econom@@ y , Mat@@ thi@@ as M@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ ig ( S@@ P@@ D ) , on the other hand , referred to the plans as major progress .
The Commission included in the reforms key points which Federal Econom@@ ics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed with other EU trade ministers .
The old system of private a@@ r@@ bit@@ ration courts is off the table .
The French government , too , welcomed Mal@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ö@@ m 's plans .
The European business association Bus@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ Europe warned against restri@@ cting the options for industry to take legal action with too many new rules .
Sm@@ all and medium sized enterprises in particular could be disa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ aged , they said .
When talks over the TT@@ IP free trade agreement can be concluded was still unclear on Wednesday .
N@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ t@@ i@@ ations have been taking place since the middle of 20@@ 13 .
The issue of investor protection , however , has to date not been discussed with the USA .
It was originally planned for a structure for the agreement to be completed by the end of this year .
This date is no longer t@@ e@@ n@@ able .
E@@ x@@ q@@ u@@ i@@ s@@ ite folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens sits on the stage in the Prime Club ( now Lux@@ or ) in Cologne .
Bes@@ ide him stands a fli@@ p chart on which the s@@ h@@ y-@@ seem@@ ing folk singer has drawn the pic@@ turesque US state of Michigan in fel@@ t-@@ tip pen .
The entire audience , some 40 people , is virtually mes@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ ised by Stevens 's performance .
Refer@@ ring to different places , which each time he marks on the map , he talks about the stories behind his m@@ e@@ t@@ i@@ cul@@ ously and sub@@ tly contri@@ ved songs .
Where they origin@@ ated , and what it looks like , in his home country .
Since then Stevens has proved himself to be a won@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ fully creative nut@@ case .
His third album , " Gre@@ e@@ t@@ ings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , " released in 2003 , features cle@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ly composed songs which cling harmon@@ ically to the traditions of American folk rock of the late six@@ ties , but which might dri@@ ft at any time into amazing o@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ence .
Rum@@ our has it that " Michigan " was the first part of a bold series : it was to have been followed by songs about each of the 50 United States .
But in 2004 in the Rh@@ ine area , " Seven Sw@@ ans " came out , bursting positive expectations .
Stevens seems to have down@@ sized here .
Pla@@ ying live he only needs a guitar and ban@@ jo .
One year later the New Yor@@ k-based musician returns to his series .
With " Illinois " ( " Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens I@@ n@@ v@@ ites You To : Come On Fe@@ el The Illin@@ o@@ ise " ) in 2005 , a widely acclaimed m@@ a@@ ster@@ piece is released .
E@@ x@@ u@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ ant with ideas and sty@@ l@@ i@@ stic sophist@@ ication .
The album clim@@ bs the American Billboard charts and appears in every best album of the year list in the influential music press .
After extremely productive experiments Stevens then serves up " The A@@ ge of Ad@@ z " ( 2010 ) , an elaborate electronic set piece .
This sixth proper studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by p@@ r@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ m@@ med sequences or b@@ e@@ ats and plays with a variety of effects and echoes .
Long since moved on from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here are becoming colo@@ u@@ r@@ ful spectac@@ les with n@@ e@@ on head@@ bands and huge flu@@ ores@@ cent stage decor@@ ations .
Currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stevens is tour@@ ing Germany as part of a five-@@ man band .
Hamburg M@@ e@@ h@@ r kept in the dark !
Since March the theatre has primarily presented " Carrie and Lowell . "
Although an audience of almost 2000 sit s@@ p@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ bound in their seats , the clearly more mature Stevens returns to intim@@ acy and to folk .
Without directing a word at the public the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album .
From the audience one can hear : the performance is more " o@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ent " and it makes you want to " c@@ h@@ u@@ ck away the album . "
Only with his e@@ n@@ core does Stevens give his modest thanks , play a few of his older songs a@@ c@@ o@@ u@@ stically and finally take a b@@ o@@ w to t@@ h@@ under@@ ous applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n to make debut at Prime Minister 's Questions
Since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's debut at PM@@ Q@@ s has been keenly awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his debut at Prime Minister 's Questions later , taking on David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six allo@@ tted questions shortly after midday , with his performance likely to be closely scrut@@ i@@ n@@ ised by the media and Labour MPs .
He has called for " less theatre and more facts " at the weekly show@@ piece .
He has also said he could skip some sessions , leaving them to colleagues .
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's leadership , coming after his appointment of a sha@@ dow cabinet and his speech to the TU@@ C annual c@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ ress on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , the Labour leader 's decision to stand in silence during the singing of the national a@@ n@@ them at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has attracted criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's decision not to sing the national a@@ n@@ them has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had " stood in respec@@ tful silence " and did recognise the " hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . "
But a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's sha@@ dow cabinet , Owen Smith , told BBC Two 's News@@ night programme he would have advised the Labour leader to sing the national a@@ n@@ them " irrespective " of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
Nearly a dozen sha@@ dow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's top team , citing differences over the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally backed him as leader .
BBC political cor@@ respondent Robin Bran@@ t says policy differences are also " s@@ t@@ a@@ c@@ king up " within Labour following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n 's appointment over its position on the European Union and the government 's cap on benefits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference Labour was putting forward amend@@ ments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether .
Hours later Mr Smith , the sha@@ dow work and pen@@ sions secretary , said the party was " very clear " that it was only opposing government plans to reduce the level of cap from £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23,@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has faced across the d@@ e@@ s@@ patch box over the past decade since he became Tory leader .
The Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to politics , says he has " crowd sour@@ ced " ideas for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions .
The Is@@ l@@ ington North MP has said PM@@ Q@@ s is too confrontational and that he will refra@@ in from both " r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ tee " and trading bar@@ bs , instead vowing to focus on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eag@@ le , the sha@@ dow business secretary , will d@@ e@@ put@@ ise for him at PM@@ Q@@ s when he does not attend - for instance when Mr Cameron is trav@@ elling abroad .
He has also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor on occasion , saying he had approached the Comm@@ ons Speaker John B@@ e@@ r@@ cow to discuss the issue .
When he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the " Punch and Jud@@ y " style of politics often associated with PM@@ Q@@ s but admitted some years later that he had failed .
Since it was first televised in 1990 , PM@@ Q@@ s has been seen as a key bar@@ ometer of a leader 's judgement , their command of the Comm@@ ons and their standing among their fellow MPs although critics have argued it has become a car@@ icature and is in need of far-@@ reaching reforms .

P@@ o@@ und rises as UK wage growth a@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ r@@ ates
The pound jumped following data showing a p@@ ick@@ -up in UK wage growth , while the FT@@ SE 100 was led higher by bid target SAB@@ Miller .
Between May and July , UK earnings excluding bonuses grew 2.9 % compared with the same period last year .
The rate was the fast@@ est since 2009 , and was seen as bringing forward estimates of when rates might rise .
Sterling rose more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 55@@ 05 and was up 0@@ .@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
The FT@@ SE 100 index closed up 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SAB@@ Miller was the stand@@ -@@ out stock on the market , jumping 20 % after it received a bid approach from rival AB I@@ n@@ B@@ e@@ v .
A deal would combine the world 's two largest bre@@ wers , bringing together brands such as B@@ u@@ d@@ w@@ e@@ iser , S@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ a A@@ r@@ t@@ o@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ s@@ ch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0@@ .@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Rich@@ e@@ m@@ ont .
Rich@@ e@@ m@@ ont 's latest sales figures beat expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - had begun to grow again .
Shares in Gl@@ e@@ n@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said it had raised $ 2.@@ 5@@ bn through a share placement as part of its deb@@ t-@@ cutting strategy .
Shares in packaging and paper group M@@ o@@ n@@ di were the biggest f@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ ers on the index , down 4.@@ 3 % , after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the firm to " sell . "
J@@ D Sports rose 3.@@ 1 % after the spor@@ t@@ s@@ wear firm reported an 83 % jump in half-@@ year pre-tax profits to £ 4@@ 6.@@ 6m .
J@@ D Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
J@@ D Sports Executive Chairman Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean " more spending power in the p@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ ets of potential consumers . "
But that spending power is unlikely to o@@ u@@ t@@ w@@ e@@ i@@ gh the higher lab@@ our costs at his firm , he says .
The costs could hit J@@ D Sports ' expansion plans , he added , which could mean fewer extra jobs .
Justin Bie@@ ber in the capital city : on a Bie@@ ber e@@ x@@ p@@ edition in Berlin
Justin Bie@@ ber , m@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ ar .
A ridiculous 21 years young , a w@@ imp@@ y kid with a too trend@@ y hair@@ cut .
The guy with the platinum blond hair is worth a hundred million euros .
P@@ r@@ o@@ bably even more .
At the moment M@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ i@@ e@@ ur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
And the under@@ -@@ 17 generation is going b@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ k .
Like W@@ i@@ k@@ tor@@ ia Rud@@ zin@@ s@@ k@@ a .
The 15-year-old has never heard the name Ritz Carl@@ ton .
Not so bad .
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday .
Including Eva and Vik@@ tor@@ ia from Poland .
But the Pol@@ es have been sitting on the cold stone sla@@ b in front of the luxury Berlin hotel on the P@@ o@@ t@@ s@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ er Plat@@ z since 7 o '@@ clock in the morning .
The Bie@@ ber building : their ido@@ l , whose face appears on huge numbers of posters in S@@ z@@ c@@ z@@ e@@ c@@ in , has been staying here since Monday evening .
The suite where the Canadian singer is staying costs as much for one night as her mother E@@ wa e@@ a@@ r@@ ns in six months .
At least .
She says : " My Vik@@ tor@@ ia should really be sitting in the 10th class in the g@@ r@@ a@@ mm@@ ar school at the moment . "
" I 'm ful@@ filling her dream for her . "
Comp@@ u@@ l@@ sory education ?
Who wants that ?
Not the fans .
Nor Bie@@ ber himself .
He is financi@@ ally secure anyway .
He is earning three million for advertising in the commercial break at the Super Bowl , a two-year deal with an anti-@@ spot company p@@ o@@ urs many many dollars into Bie@@ ber 's account .
And for every d@@ oll that looks like him and passes over the counter Bie@@ ber cash@@ es in as well .
When Justin Bie@@ ber drinks coffee people g@@ o@@ gg@@ le through the window .
He has loo@@ ted more than a hundred million like that .
Some say the h@@ yp@@ e goes too far .
Others point out that after all Bie@@ ber is charting in both the USA and Great Britain with his new single " What do you mean ? " at number one .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose new album is due out in November , is not interested in all those zer@@ os .
At least that 's what he says .
Pe@@ g@@ i@@ da poster suggests the idea of p@@ o@@ t@@ ato don@@ er keb@@ abs to Lebanese man
P@@ o@@ tat@@ oes or don@@ er keb@@ ab ?
You can have both - in the p@@ o@@ t@@ ato keb@@ ab that Ol@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ b@@ u@@ r@@ g sn@@ ack bar owner H@@ ani A@@ l@@ h@@ a@@ y has created .
I@@ n@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ red by the slogan " p@@ o@@ tat@@ oes instead of keb@@ abs " on a Pe@@ g@@ i@@ da movement poster , A@@ l@@ h@@ a@@ y put p@@ o@@ tat@@ oes and meat together on a s@@ k@@ e@@ wer .
A poster at a Pe@@ g@@ i@@ da demonstration with the slogan " P@@ o@@ tat@@ oes instead of keb@@ abs " which he happened to see on television gave him the idea .
Since then a spit laden with meat and p@@ o@@ tat@@ oes has been rot@@ ating in his shop .
" That is multi-@@ cultural food ! " says A@@ l@@ h@@ a@@ y .
Now he has registered his idea at the pat@@ ent office in Mun@@ ich .
According to officials there it is now protected as a registered design .
Because of this , A@@ l@@ h@@ a@@ y does not want to reveal how much meat and how many p@@ o@@ tat@@ oes the spit holds .
Just enough so that , " They taste much better together , " he reckons .
Customers also appreciate this international cul@@ inary understanding .
Met@@ cash laun@@ ches grassroots campaign to fight A@@ l@@ di incursion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect its I@@ GA stores from an A@@ l@@ di onslau@@ ght in South Australia and Western Australia .
Gro@@ cer@@ y w@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ a@@ l@@ er Met@@ cash has kicked off a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million A@@ l@@ di invasion .
As A@@ l@@ di prepares to open two distribution cent@@ res and the first of as many as 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets are s@@ t@@ r@@ eng@@ t@@ h@@ ening relationships with local food suppliers and building the I@@ GA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adel@@ aide show .
I@@ GA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as D@@ u@@ n@@ s@@ bor@@ o@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ -based ice cream maker S@@ imm@@ o 's offering taste testing at I@@ GA stores and store owners selling dis@@ counted South Australian football league tickets to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the food , liquor and hardware w@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ a@@ l@@ er hosts its annual investor strategy day .
There is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cash 's I@@ GA store footprint and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ cash 's I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
South Australian and Western Australian shoppers are notor@@ i@@ ously p@@ a@@ r@@ och@@ ial and I@@ GA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NS@@ W , Vic@@ tor@@ ia and Q@@ u@@ e@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA compared with around 14 per cent in the Eastern states .
However , analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe A@@ l@@ di will sn@@ are around 5 per cent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores , taking sales from all existing players but mainly from independent retailers .
In a report this week , Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kier@@ ath estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million a year in sales and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 20@@ 16 .
This forecast is based on the assu@@ mption that A@@ l@@ di opens 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
The loss of food and grocery sales and volumes on Met@@ cash 's high fix@@ ed-@@ cost base could cost Met@@ cash around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr Kier@@ ath said .
At the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market share in the eastern states , mainly to A@@ l@@ di and Col@@ es , even though a recent Roy Morgan survey found I@@ GA shoppers were most loyal .
Morgan Stanley believes Met@@ cash 's food and grocery sales will fall 3.@@ 8 per cent in 20@@ 16 , 4.@@ 1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 20@@ 18 , reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 20@@ 15 to 10.3 per cent by 2020 .
Last week , leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ellan Financial Group , told a business lunch in Mel@@ bourne that Met@@ cash could " highly , probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash has declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass ' comments .
But it is understood that a Met@@ cash board member contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
I@@ GA 's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and earnings from Met@@ cash 's food and grocery business , which supplies about 1200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating del@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ age as sales and margins come under pressure .
However , the w@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ a@@ l@@ er is fighting back , investing more than $ 150 million a year matching s@@ h@@ e@@ l@@ f prices at Col@@ es and Wo@@ o@@ l@@ w@@ o@@ r@@ ths on hundreds of products each week , helping I@@ GA retailers refurb@@ ish stores by adding fast@@ er-@@ growing fresh food , and rolling out a better range of private label g@@ r@@ o@@ cer@@ ies .
Met@@ cash chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says the price matching and store ref@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ish@@ ment programs are gaining traction and is hoping the w@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ a@@ l@@ er will return to under@@ lying profit growth in 2017 , for the first time in four years .
Than@@ a@@ s@@ i K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ a@@ k@@ is backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Than@@ a@@ s@@ i K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ a@@ k@@ is deserves k@@ u@@ dos rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ a@@ s@@ i K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ a@@ k@@ is has been the collateral damage in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ g@@ i@@ os and deserves k@@ u@@ dos rather than criticism for his own behaviour , according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy .
K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ a@@ k@@ is , the younger of the talented duo regularly referred to as the " Special K@@ s , " was dragged into an unwelcome spotlight by the infamous Kyr@@ g@@ i@@ os sle@@ dge of S@@ t@@ an W@@ aw@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after , K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ a@@ k@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the chair u@@ m@@ p@@ ire , with Harrison declar@@ ing : " W@@ aw@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ka should 've decked Kyr@@ g@@ i@@ os , and I should deck that kid . "
While he was last seen sm@@ ashing a rac@@ quet after cra@@ m@@ p f@@ o@@ iled a potential US Open upset of Richard Gasquet , K@@ o@@ k@@ kin@@ a@@ k@@ is has been defended s@@ t@@ a@@ u@@ n@@ c@@ h@@ ly by Healy .
The teenager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gro@@ th for the second singles berth behind Bern@@ ard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi-@@ final against Britain .
" One thing I do feel quite keenly about is I think Than@@ a@@ s@@ i 's been dragged into the fray a little bit , " Healy said .
He did break a rac@@ quet when he lost when he cra@@ mped in the US , but he 's not the first player to break a rac@@ quet out of frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ a@@ s@@ i well enough to know he wouldn 't be proud of that .
But , really , he 's handled himself extremely well , in pretty p@@ r@@ o@@ voc@@ ative circumstances in the US with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of credit .
He 's a great team around him , he 's got a great family around him and I just think he 's been a little hard done by .
He 's a very mature 19-year-old , he works very hard , and he fits in with the team and so on , he hasn 't ever had an issue with the other players , he 's well respected in the locker room , he trains hard , he 's in great shape , he 's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
Healy also backed the decision to over@@ look Kyr@@ g@@ i@@ os for the important tie , starting on Friday , describing the " mut@@ ual decision " as the right thing for all , but backing the Can@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ ran to return as a long-term fix@@ ture in the team .
" First of all we want the team to be completely focused on the tie and not all the controversy around [ Kyr@@ g@@ i@@ os ] , " Healy said .
And I think Nick , he 's risen very quickly , as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out , he 's growing up in the public eye and he 's made some terrible errors and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we 're trying to support him , we 're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions , and some time out of the lim@@ e@@ l@@ ight where he can just reflect on that I think is appropriate and it 's best for the team and it 's best for him .
Europe mig@@ rant crisis : Hung@@ ary declares emergency , seals border , d@@ e@@ t@@ a@@ ins mig@@ rants
Dec@@ lar@@ ing a state of emergency , Hung@@ ary sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those trying to enter illegally , aiming to shut down the flow of mig@@ rants pouring in .
Cha@@ os ensued at the border , as hundreds of mig@@ rants piled up in a no man 's land , and Serbian officials reacted with outrage .
Stu@@ ck for an unknown amount of time on a strip of road between the two countries ' checkpoints , those fleeing violence in their hom@@ e@@ l@@ ands pitched t@@ ents and settled in .
But fru@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ations were on the rise .
As a police helicopter hovered above , mig@@ rants chan@@ ted " Open the border ! " and shouted insul@@ ts at Hung@@ arian riot police .
Some refused food and water in protest .
Serbia 's foreign minister declared it was " unacceptable " that mig@@ rants were being sent back from Hung@@ ary while more and more were arriving from Mac@@ edonia and Gre@@ ece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution , not collateral damage .
There will have to be talks in the coming days with Brussels and other countries , " I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic said in Pra@@ gue .
The turmoil at the Hung@@ ari@@ an-@@ Serbian border came a day after the 28-@@ nation bloc failed to come up with a united immigration policy at a conten@@ tious meeting in Brussels .
The ministers did agree to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refu@@ ge in overwhelmed Italy and Gre@@ ece and spoke hopefully of reaching an eventual deal - next month or by the end of the year - on which EU nations would take 120@@ ,000 more refugees , including some from Hung@@ ary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called Tuesday for a special European Union summit next week to discuss the continent 's immigration crisis .
Hung@@ ary , however , was not p@@ inning its hopes on any action soon from Brussels or its neighbors .
Tuesday 's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asyl@@ um court cases .
Meanwhile , Hung@@ arian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ jj@@ a@@ r@@ to said his country is also planning to build a r@@ a@@ z@@ or-@@ wire fence along part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of mig@@ rants through the country , now that it has finished a fence on the Serbian border .
CBS News cor@@ respondent Charlie D '@@ Ag@@ a@@ t@@ a reported that even prison inmates were e@@ n@@ listed in the race to finish the razor wire fence between Hung@@ ary and Serbia .
In the last few months , Hung@@ ary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for mig@@ rants , many of them war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , has insisted that most arriving are economic mig@@ rants seeking a better life , not war refugees entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU nations , including Germany .
The new laws that took effect at midnight in Hung@@ ary now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-@@ meter ( 13-@@ foot ) r@@ a@@ z@@ or-@@ wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia and also includes longer prison terms for convicted human traffickers .
" Due to the situation caused by mass mig@@ ration , the Hung@@ arian government declares a state of crisis , " government spokesman Z@@ o@@ l@@ tan Ko@@ vac@@ s told reporters in the southern city of S@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ ed .
We are very clear on this : Il@@ legal border crossing is a crime .
Techn@@ ically , parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , expected next week , but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ o@@ r@@ gy B@@ a@@ k@@ o@@ n@@ di , homeland security adviser to Or@@ ban , said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross at the border and 15 deeper in the country .
They got across by damaging the fence , are now in police custody and are being charged with commit@@ ting offenses under the new laws .
Authorities are quickly rep@@ airing the fence .
Hung@@ arian officials also closed two of seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after deplo@@ ying a train car covered with razor wire to close one of them .
Cha@@ os envelop@@ ed the main border crossing near R@@ o@@ sz@@ ke , Hung@@ ary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a tiny office in a metal c@@ o@@ n@@ tain@@ er to process people and crowds pressed to squeeze inside .
About 20 managed to get in , but thousands remained outside .
Another group of mig@@ rants blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hung@@ ary , saying they were refusing food and water until they are allowed to cross into Hung@@ ary .
Ele@@ ction 20@@ 16 : Hillary Clinton 's lead over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally , but Sen. Bernie Sanders is gaining on her .
Clinton now has the backing of 47 percent of Democratic primary voters ( down from 58 percent ) , while Sanders comes in second , with 27 percent ( up from 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Biden , who has yet to announce whether he is running for president , receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters .
More than five months before the start of the primary contests , most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are made up about which candidate they will support .
But Clinton 's backers are more firm in their choice than those backing other candidates .
Since last month 's CBS News Poll , Clinton has lost ground among a number of demograph@@ ic groups , while Sanders has made some gains .
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and moder@@ ates , but those leads have narrowed .
Her support among men has dropped considerably and Sanders only trails her by 5 points .
Clinton 's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated , and she and Sanders are now even .
However , Clinton still has a large lead with older voters .
Last month , Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-@@ dig@@ its among liber@@ als , but Sanders now has a 5-@@ point edge with this group .
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusi@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ ically support Clinton if she became the party 's nominee .
A quarter would support her with some reserv@@ ations and another 15 percent would only back her because she is the nominee .
Six percent would not support her .
Perhaps not surpris@@ ingly , Clinton 's current supporters are especially likely to be enthusiastic about her .
Vie@@ ws are more mixed among those not currently backing Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ ically support her .
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusi@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ ically back Clinton , fewer Republican voters say that about their fron@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ n@@ ner , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
When Clinton 's supporters are asked in an open-@@ ended question why they want her to be the nominee , the top answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by it 's time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Also mentioned by Clinton supporters is her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
Agre@@ ement on the issues , and elec@@ tability are also cited .
As the vice president weigh@@ s a potential run for president , 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him jump in the race - although a third don 't think he should .
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party 's nomination , Biden is the top pick .
Among Clinton supporters , more than half say Biden would be their second choice , far ahead of Sanders .
If Biden choo@@ ses not to run for the Democratic nomination , Hillary Clinton 's lead over Sanders w@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ s , from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the running .
Fif@@ ty-@@ five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election ; however that figure is down from 78 percent last month .
Biden is a distant second on this measure , but the percentage that sees him as the most elec@@ table has risen .
Still , when asked which is more important in a nominee , Democratic voters pick issues over elec@@ tability .
Simil@@ ar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable as the nominee to these primary voters .
The Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , perform well on some key character@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ics among their party 's primary voters .
Maj@@ o@@ r@@ ities see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as honest and tru@@ s@@ t@@ worthy and as having strong leadership qualities .
Biden does the best of the three on honesty , while Clinton 's strength is leadership .
Thir@@ ty percent of Democratic primary voters don 't think Clinton is honest and tru@@ s@@ t@@ worthy , twice as many as say that about Sanders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don 't have an opinion of him on this .
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton , Sanders and Biden as in line with their views i@@ d@@ e@@ ologically .
On all of these measures , about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders .
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton 's use of a personal email address and server while Secretary of State , most Democratic primary voters are satis@@ fied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn 't imp@@ acted their overall views of her .
But it 's a different story among the American public overall .
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation , while just about a third are satis@@ fied .
The public 's views on this were split back in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent say their opinion of her has grown worse .
It is mainly Republicans , more than six in 10 , who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and tru@@ s@@ t@@ worthy by her party 's voters , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall : only 32 percent see her as honest and tru@@ s@@ t@@ worthy , down eight points from last month , and 15 points since May .
Six@@ ty-@@ two percent of registered voters don 't think of her as honest and tru@@ s@@ t@@ worthy .
At the same time , 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don 't see Tr@@ ump as honest and tru@@ s@@ t@@ worthy either .
Both Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good marks on leadership .
Of the six candidates tested , Biden , Car@@ son and Bush do the best on honesty .
More see Sanders as honest than not , but like Car@@ son , many don 't have an opinion of him .
The margin of error for the sample of 35@@ 1 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in national poll
Ben Car@@ son is running close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the new@@ est CBS News / New York Times poll
The two candidates account for half the support of voters in the new poll , leaving others s@@ c@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ g@@ ing for a foo@@ t@@ h@@ old
Republican voters nationwide continue to back Tr@@ ump in large numbers , climbing from 23 % support in the last CBS poll , conducted before the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the poll out Tuesday .
But Car@@ son rock@@ eted in that same period from 6 % to 23 % .
The survey also found Car@@ son doing well across demograph@@ ic groups , e@@ d@@ ging out Tr@@ ump among colle@@ ge-@@ educated Republican voters .
The rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly F@@ i@@ o@@ r@@ ina and Ohio Gov. John Ka@@ s@@ i@@ ch , has slipped behind with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling far@@ thest from 10 % support last month to 2 % now .
Former Florida Gov. Je@@ b Bush , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rub@@ io all tied for third place with 6 % .
The margin of error for the 37@@ 6-@@ person sample of Republican voters in this new@@ est poll is plus-@@ or-@@ minus 6 % , and was conducted Sept .
The latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , released last week , showed Car@@ son rising in the polls -- landing at 19 % support among Republicans , behind Tr@@ ump 's 32 % support .
The latest poll from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
Facing a rising Car@@ son last week , Tr@@ ump took some p@@ o@@ t@@ shots at the retired neu@@ r@@ o@@ surgeon , even as Car@@ son apologi@@ zed for questioning Tr@@ ump 's faith .
" We need energy , " Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa .

Five fratern@@ ity members charged in death of Bar@@ uch College freshman
Nearly two years after a college student died during a fratern@@ ity h@@ a@@ zing ritual in Pennsylvania 's P@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ o Mountains , murder charges have been filed against five people .
Members of New York City 's Bar@@ uch College P@@ i Delta P@@ si fratern@@ ity brut@@ ally assaulted C@@ h@@ un " Michael " Den@@ g during an initi@@ ation r@@ i@@ t@@ e in September 20@@ 13 and delayed taking him to the hospital , contributing to his death , police said .
Officials said he was blin@@ d@@ f@@ o@@ l@@ ded , s@@ a@@ dd@@ led with a 30-@@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly tac@@ kled while he tried to walk toward a target across a fro@@ zen field .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually complained that his head hurt then fell unconscious .
P@@ i Delta P@@ si fratern@@ ity members did not call 911 after Den@@ g passed out , and allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to a hospital , police say .
They did , however , find time to change Den@@ g 's clothes , Google his symptoms , and contact Andy Men@@ g , the fratern@@ ity 's national president to seek advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference .
" At this point , members began to hide p@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ alia and basically put the fratern@@ ity 's well-@@ being over that of Michael Den@@ g 's , " Chief Wagner said .
He could not be revived and he died the next morning .
According to an autopsy report , Den@@ g was sub@@ jected to repeated blunt force t@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ ma to his head , tor@@ so , and t@@ h@@ igh@@ s .
" Too many families have been devastated as a result of fratern@@ ity h@@ a@@ zing , with at least one student dying every year from h@@ a@@ zing since 1970 , " Douglas Fier@@ berg , an attorney representing Den@@ g 's family , said in a statement .
F@@ rat@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ ities and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is an important one .
A Monroe County grand jury recommended third-@@ degree murder charges for the first five members .
Thir@@ ty-@@ two other fratern@@ ity members , including Mr. Men@@ g , will also be charged with assault h@@ a@@ zing and criminal conspiracy .
" We want to hold not only the individuals involved , but if there 's an organization that sanc@@ tion@@ ed it , whether officially or u@@ n@@ officially , we 're going to hold them accountable as well , " Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College banned the fratern@@ ity and the national fratern@@ ity rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local chapter .
Here 's what will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike will come and the bull market will stum@@ ble , bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession .
This we know .
What we don 't know is how long all of that will take and how long it will last .
For the economy specifically , history offers little guide about timing .
A recession has come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months .
The Federal Reserve 's aggres@@ s@@ i@@ veness in raising rates is often , though not always , a determin@@ ant in how the economy and financial assets respond .
That 's why officials at the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not be focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the t@@ r@@ a@@ jec@@ tory of how long it will take to norm@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ ze .
There are , indeed , multiple vari@@ a@@ b@@ les at play .
In the end , however , market participants may find that all the rat@@ e@@ -@@ hike f@@ uss may have been over@@ done .
" The first hike from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ itably be interpre@@ ted by some as sign@@ aling the end of the era of ' cheap money , ' " Juli@@ an J@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ p , chief global economist at Capital Econom@@ ics , said in a note to clients .
In contrast , we do not expect the g@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ u@@ al return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that many seem to fear .
That 's not to say there won 't be effects , however .
Here 's a look at how some areas of the economy could react , based on historical trends :
As the market has seen over the past month or so , anticip@@ ation of rate hik@@ es can make things volat@@ ile for a while .
Once the hike hits , though , the impact is not as dramatic .
" It does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-@@ 24 months after the first hike , which again perhaps reflects the l@@ a@@ g in monetary policy , " Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hik@@ es .
More specifically , the market over the past 35 years or so is most often up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike , fairly flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) then back to normal once 500 days have passed , with average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis Bob Doll , chief equity strategist at Nu@@ ve@@ en As@@ set Management , posted on Bar@@ ron 's .
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rat@@ e@@ -@@ hiking cycle and returns begin to dimin@@ ish .
Rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but rate hik@@ es often help them along .
In the current case , the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and could h@@ a@@ sten a recession .
Most notably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point ever for a Fed rate hike .
According to Deutsche Bank , in the 118 rate hik@@ es since 1@@ 9@@ 50 , only twice has nomin@@ al year over year GDP been below 4.5 percent .
Even though the second quarter of 20@@ 15 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , few expect that to last , with the third quarter tracking at just 1.5 percent , according to the Atlanta Fed .
Hi@@ king rates into such a fragile economic back@@ drop could be risky and set up the question of " whether this time is different , " Deutsche said .
Market participants have been bra@@ cing for a Fed hike all year , with all eyes turned toward this week 's Federal Open Market Committee meeting , which ends Thursday .
While many strateg@@ ists and economists believe the FOM@@ C could approve a hike at this meeting , futures trading indic@@ ates just a 25 percent prob@@ ability .
" In our study since 1@@ 9@@ 50 , all hiking cycles to date have been in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP e@@ c@@ l@@ i@@ p@@ sing pr@@ e@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ ession peaks very quickly post the recovery commen@@ cing , " the report said .
By contrast this has been a uni@@ quely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period .
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record had been 35 months , and this is 74 months and counting .
Fi@@ xed income also has been volat@@ ile as the market anticip@@ ates a rate hike , and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equ@@ ities experience .
The principal difference is that the impact happens faster in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy .
For bonds , it does seem yields change direction immediately as the first hike / cut in the cycle arrives .
At the end of the hiking cycle bond yields fall immediately , " Deutsche said .
Charles S@@ c@@ h@@ wa@@ b strateg@@ ists believe the hike in rates will cause yields between l@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ r@@ - and shor@@ ter-@@ dated bonds to move closer together , flat@@ tening the curve .
High@@ -@@ yield bonds often perform better in such a climate , though " we are still cautious about stretching for yield , " Kath@@ y Jones , fixed income analyst at S@@ c@@ h@@ wa@@ b , said in an analysis .
I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ingly , Jones thinks markets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations .
" In addition to the strength in the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy , " she wrote .
Short-term interest rates are up , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , credit s@@ p@@ reads have widened and volatility has increased - all character@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ics of the market when the Fed tigh@@ tens policy .
Broad@@ ly speaking , companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
Mul@@ tin@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ als with lots of debt will fare worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance .
" History shows that ' quality ' stocks tend to out@@ perform during the three months following an initial rate hike , " Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients .
F@@ i@@ r@@ ms with strong balance sheets out@@ pac@@ ed weak balance sheet companies following each of the 1994 , 1999 , and 2004 rate hik@@ es , by an average of 5 percentage points .
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also out@@ performed their lower quality counterparts , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) , respectively .
Deb@@ t will become a big issue .
Companies with a high percentage of flo@@ ating rate debt stand to lose the most , Goldman said .
Outside p@@ ure stock plays , consumers stand to benefit as well through the rising dollar .
Sa@@ vers could see gains as well through higher yields at the , though experts differ on how quickly that will take hold .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
Conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham criticised station for ' dum@@ bing down@@ '
A@@ r@@ gues it 's becoming increasingly i@@ n@@ disting@@ u@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ a@@ b@@ le from commercial rival
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , saying they just r@@ i@@ p off the Br@@ its
Colle@@ ague Dam@@ i@@ en Collins MP attacked The Voice , saying that too wasn 't original
BBC Radio 3 is " turning into " Classic FM , a leading MP has claimed , p@@ iling fresh pressure on the broadcast@@ er to prove that it does something that commercial broadcast@@ ers do not .
Conservative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appeared to be " dum@@ bing down " and is becoming increasingly i@@ n@@ disting@@ u@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ a@@ b@@ le from its commercial rival .
" Radio 3 seems to be - I don 't like to use the word " dum@@ bing down " - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM , " he said .
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
The BBC Music Awards which started last year seem to be the Br@@ its by another name .
So , if you 're trying to do something different - those are two examples from the top of my head where you 're actually just m@@ i@@ m@@ icking what is already on the market , " Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC director general denied the charges , arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
What I learn from Radio 3 , I am not going to learn about classi@@ cal music from anywhere else .
And it 's commitment to live music and music making is actually second to none .
" And also , Radio 3 's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works I think is also really important , " he said .
Earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it has to work harder to engage audiences than it did in the past , because Britons are less educated about classi@@ cal music .
However , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC 's output which came under fire for t@@ r@@ e@@ ading on the toes of commercial rivals , during the Cul@@ ture , Media and Sport select committee hearing .
Tory MP Dam@@ i@@ en Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show which the BBC bought in from Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22@@ million .
Can you see why that programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not particularly distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BB@@ C@@ 1 show - which stars Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as judges - was produced " in a particularly BBC way . "
He added that he wants the Corporation to " find a hit from our own in-@@ house stable " next time it laun@@ ches an entertainment series .
However , he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future , or spending lic@@ ence fee payers ' money on other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased at s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ est ever rate in August and Black Friday may be to blame
First three months of 20@@ 15 saw seven per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw lowest growth rise since records began in 2000
Online sales bol@@ stered three years ago by the use of mobile for shopping
Experts believe November 's Black Friday could be holding back spending
For over a decade virtual shopping has been booming and turning many of Britain 's high streets into ghost towns .
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are level@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 20@@ 15 .
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 , with just a five per cent rise on last year .
Experts say there are signs that online sales are level@@ ing off , after new figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 20@@ 15
'@@ If you look at growth levels for previous years and go back to 2000 , it was always going to r@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ alise over time , ' Andy Mul@@ c@@ a@@ h@@ y , editor of IM@@ RG sales index , told the Guardian .
He explained that online sales were bol@@ stered three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases .
It meant more people were able to shop online and that people could do it in different c@@ o@@ n@@ tex@@ ts , such as on the sofa .
But now that is plat@@ e@@ a@@ u@@ ing a bit , you might see ( growth ) fall away .
The Black Friday phenomenon , which has been impor@@ ted from America , is being cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing sales .
Experts believe shoppers could be holding off making purchases ahead of the event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
Last year five times the average number of shoppers flo@@ cked to their computers to snap up deals cr@@ ashing a number of retailers websites .
Experts believe Black Friday , which saw shoppers fight over bar@@ gains , could be holding shoppers off from making purchases
Research published by the British Retail C@@ o@@ n@@ sor@@ t@@ i@@ um found just over £ 1 in every £ 5 was being spent online .
For some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done through web stores .
At the same time , more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online , rather than using high street fashion chains .
Muslims bury those killed in M@@ e@@ c@@ ca c@@ rane crash as Bin Laden family sanc@@ tion@@ ed
Bodies of 29 of the dead carried through the streets by Muslims as the first funerals take place in M@@ e@@ c@@ ca
Come as Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Bin@@ lad@@ in Group
The Health Ministry said a total of 39@@ 4 people were also injured after the c@@ rane crashed down
Car@@ ried a@@ l@@ o@@ ft through the streets , hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 of the victims killed when a c@@ rane collapsed at M@@ e@@ c@@ ca 's Grand mosque .
Dressed largely in white , m@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ ers packed the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-@@ M@@ o@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ m cem@@ etery .
The sad possession passed by the holy site , where just days earlier a construction c@@ rane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and top@@ pled onto worshi@@ pers .
The bodies were released for funeral as the Saudi King sanc@@ tion@@ ed the Bin Laden family construction group over the disaster , which also left 39@@ 4 injured .
The bodies of 29 of the worshi@@ pers killed when a c@@ rane crashed collapsed at M@@ e@@ c@@ ca 's Grand Central M@@ o@@ squ@@ e were carried through the streets
Among the dead was fath@@ er-@@ of-@@ four Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram , from Bolton , Greater Manchester , who was on his first pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age when the c@@ rane crashed down .
Mr Ak@@ ram had been in the Grand M@@ o@@ squ@@ e with his parents ahead of the start of the annual h@@ a@@ j@@ j pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age .
Saudi officials have already vowed that the h@@ a@@ j@@ j to M@@ e@@ c@@ ca will go ahead with thousands continuing to desc@@ end on the city .
Today , King Salman said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group should not have left the c@@ rane 's arm up when it was not in use .
An Arabic version of the decree , carried by the state-@@ run Saudi Press Agency , said the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group was partly to blame for the collapse .
The news agency 's English service did not report that detail , but did say leaders of the company have been banned from trav@@ elling abroad .
Earlier this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the c@@ rane to topp@@ le into a court@@ yard of the Grand M@@ o@@ squ@@ e , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims have conver@@ ged ahead of the h@@ a@@ j@@ j pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age later this month .
Bin@@ lad@@ in Group has not released any statements about the c@@ rane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment .
The royal decree also blamed the group for not using up-to-@@ date safety measures and failing to coordinate with meteor@@ ological officials .
Do@@ zens of c@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ es surround M@@ e@@ c@@ ca 's Grand M@@ o@@ squ@@ e , part of the massive construction effort headed by the Bin@@ lad@@ in Group .
The Bin@@ lad@@ in family has been close to Saudi Arabia 's ruling family for decades and runs major building projects .
Al Qaida 's late leader Osama bin Laden was a r@@ e@@ n@@ e@@ g@@ ade son dis@@ owned by the family in the 1990s .
The crash came amid high winds and rain just days before millions arrive in the king@@ dom for the pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age , which is required at least once in the life of every a@@ b@@ le-@@ b@@ o@@ died Muslim .
Officials said 15@@ 8 people remain in hospital .
Officials ordered one million r@@ i@@ y@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) be paid to the relatives of those killed , and the same amount to those perman@@ ently injured .
Others injured will receive half that amount .
B & Q boss says Eastern European t@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ men working cheap is behind trend
Britons are increasingly emplo@@ ying hand@@ y@@ men says V@@ e@@ r@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
Number of skilled t@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ men from Eastern Europe behind rise
Resul@@ ting in 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , aimed at t@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ men , opening
At same time K@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ f@@ isher is closing 60 B & Q outlets across the country
By Ru@@ pert S@@ t@@ e@@ i@@ n@@ er , Chief City Cor@@ respondent for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to be putting down their h@@ a@@ m@@ m@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush@@ es in favour of emplo@@ ying skilled Eastern European t@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ men to carry out work in their home
If you are hand@@ y with a hammer or a w@@ h@@ i@@ z@@ z at pain@@ ting walls , it seems you are in the minority these days .
Because Britons are increasingly emplo@@ ying hand@@ y@@ men to carry out DI@@ Y jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B & Q .
V@@ e@@ r@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry , new chief executive of K@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ f@@ isher , which owns the home improvement chain , said a big rise in the number of skilled t@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ men from Eastern Europe offering services at rock@@ -@@ bottom prices is behind the trend .
As a result , K@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at t@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ men , while closing 60 B & Q outlets .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants more women to be employed in B & Q shops because eight out of ten purch@@ asing decisions in store are made by the fair@@ er sex .
Currently the majority of staff are men .
She said there was a need to address growing demograph@@ ic trends which have seen more single female households who are doing more home improvements than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : " We still have a majority of men working in our stores .
We need to move more towards a balance .
F@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ally half of our customers are female with 80 per cent of the decisions over items purchased taken by women .
Women play a big part in the dec@@ ision@@ -making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the helm of Britain 's FT@@ SE@@ 100 index of leading firms , has also r@@ e@@ structured her top team to reflect an equ@@ al number of men and women directors .
K@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ f@@ isher is almost alone in having exactly 50 per cent of its team s@@ t@@ a@@ ffed by women , including its chief executive and finance director .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : " This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
It has not been difficult to find good women to put on our board .
K@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ f@@ isher posted a fall in both half-@@ year profit and sales after the group s@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ dered the cost of shutting stores .
As a result of the trend K@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ f@@ isher , which owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B & Q , is opening 200 new stores
Officials from A@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ -@@ D@@ o@@ b in court for breach of trust
Two officials from the Austrian volle@@ y@@ ball run@@ ner@@ -up champion team A@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ -@@ D@@ o@@ b attended the Kl@@ a@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ f@@ urt regional court on Wednesday to answer charges of breach of trust and tax evasion .
The defendants pleaded not guilty .
One of them had also also been charged with abuse of his position .
He was leg@@ ally acquitted of this charge in May .
The current case was adjour@@ ned .
According to senior Public Prosec@@ u@@ t@@ or Robert Ri@@ ffel , it emerged during preliminary investigations that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defendants used monies from the club 's accounts , to which they had access due to their roles , for private purposes .
The loss is estimated at around € 400,000 .
The sports officials are also accused of financial offen@@ ces .
The Cha@@ i@@ r@@ woman of the Lay Judge Senate , Judge Mich@@ a@@ ela San@@ in , ordered proceedings on this fact to be post@@ poned .
It will be tried at a later date .
On the charge of breach of trust , the defence argued that the club had never at any time suffered any pec@@ uni@@ ary disa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ age
The sports officials had only offset expense a@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ances , and brought the sports club for which they worked from 1@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 to 2011 , and in which they had invested much time and money , out of debt - liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600,000 S@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ings ( around € 44,000 ) .
" At that time we were faced with the situation of whether we should continue with the club or close it down , " said one of the def@@ end@@ ents , who makes his living as an a@@ u@@ d@@ i@@ t@@ or of large companies for the tax authorities .
With his colleague and co-@@ defendant , he had then resolved to under@@ take this task .
With all the risks .
" We advanced money and depos@@ ited our life insurance policies with the bank as security , " he said during the examination .
It was agreed with the club that they had a free hand to manage the money , but they were not permitted to run up any debts .
Fur@@ ther@@ more , if there was appropriate financial success , retro@@ spec@@ tive payment of the expense a@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ance back to 1991 was agreed .
As a result , a part of the expense a@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ance was paid off years later , that is to say from the year 2003 when the account went into credit .
This is why general and not detailed deb@@ it entries appeared , was the former chairman 's explanation for the processes .
The two defendants managed the accounts and p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ books together , said the second defendant .
The Judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the club in detail .
The club was not interested in details of the financial arran@@ gements , it was only important that it should be debt free , was the answer .
When investigations into abuse of his position against one of the officers began in 2011 , a sum of € 120@@ ,000 was trans@@ ferred into the club 's account .
Those were reserves , explained the defendant .
This securities account was run in the name of the two defendants and according to a statement by the club its existence was not known to the club .
" Why ? " the Judge wanted to know .
There was no answer to this for a long time .
Then he finally said that he had thought it would be best for the club .
Had something happen to him then nobody would have known anything about this money , the State Prosec@@ u@@ t@@ or put to the room .
The co-@@ defendant knew about it , the official justified himself .
The purpose of the transfer was given as compensation for damages .
" Why compensation for damages ? " the Judge and the State Prosec@@ u@@ t@@ or wanted to know .
In response , the first defendant said that he had disa@@ greed with this w@@ o@@ r@@ ding because no damage had ever occurred to the club .
But what can I do when the lawyer says , " This lets us all off the hook " ?
" Am I a legal representative ? " he asked .
The official carried on that he had never received a cent in salary , he had only charged for m@@ i@@ l@@ e@@ age and a per d@@ i@@ em a@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ance .
The club had set aside € 1,000 per month for per d@@ i@@ em a@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ances , which were in fact expenses which would have been much higher , he added .
The defendants were not able to provide accur@@ ate documentation for the earlier years .
This was no longer kept since an audit in which everything was properly assessed , they explained .
The second defendant had also obtained a m@@ i@@ l@@ e@@ age a@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ance .
All adjustments were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his home in V@@ ö@@ l@@ ker@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ k@@ t to the bank in B@@ l@@ e@@ i@@ b@@ u@@ r@@ g , he explained in his statement .
The trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
He@@ wle@@ tt P@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ard cutting a further 30,000 jobs
In addition to the job cuts that have been taking place for the past three years , the computer giant is going to lay off even more staff with the splitting of the company .
There seems to be no end to the job cuts at the US computer giant He@@ wle@@ t@@ t@@ -P@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ard ( HP ) .
As part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to lay off between 25,000 and 30,000 staff in its corporate customer section .
This should lead to cost savings of around $ 2.7 billion ( € 2.4 billion ) , the company disclosed on Tuesday .
The step will lead to a one-off charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incur@@ red in the fourth quarter .
The reduction of 55,000 jobs which has been taking place for three years is not yet completed .
At the end of the 20@@ 13 / 14 business year HP still employed around 30@@ 2,000 staff .
At the end of trading He@@ wle@@ t@@ t@@ -P@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ard shares had fallen by 2.@@ 3 percent .
The group based in Pal@@ o Alto , California , which initially grew through its prin@@ ter sales , is currently splitting its business : this year the computer and prin@@ ter side will be combined in a new company , separated from the the promising areas of computer servers and data storage for business as well as other services .
Both operations will be listed on the stock exchange .
Repe@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ d@@ ly disappointing sales of PCs as well as a slow demand from business customers for their services have recently afflicted the world 's second-@@ largest PC manufacturer after Len@@ o@@ vo .
In the third fiscal quarter to the end of July , sales of PCs and pr@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ s fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
Revenue dropped by eight percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
This means profits have dropped in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responded to the changes in the industry with a split and massive layoffs .
The 7@@ 6@@ -year-old business headed by M@@ e@@ g Whit@@ man has been slow to react to the rise in customers buying smar@@ t@@ phones and t@@ a@@ b@@ lets instead of conven@@ tional computers and equally carrying out business more and more online .
Whit@@ man 's plans for restructuring include around 55,000 job losses .
C@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ lic@@ ts : the majority support anti IS@@ IS training mission
The majority of people , however , are opposed to direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq : 54 percent were against it , 35 percent have expressed themselves in favour .
Six@@ ty-@@ one percent reacted positi@@ vely to other countries carrying out air attacks against IS@@ IS in Iraq and Syria .
Tw@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ y-@@ four percent are against interven@@ ing in the conflict .
Fif@@ ty-@@ one percent of those surveyed are against c@@ o@@ operating with the Syrian rul@@ er Bash@@ ar al-@@ Assad , but 20 percent were in favour .
Tw@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ y-@@ nine percent were u@@ n@@ decided .
Cars : Second press day at the 66@@ th IA@@ A
At the centre of the exhibition until 27 September are i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ linked , self driving cars as well as electro-@@ mobility .
After two press days , Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66@@ th International A@@ u@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ b@@ ile Exhib@@ ition , whose m@@ o@@ t@@ to is " Mob@@ ility C@@ o@@ n@@ nec@@ ts , " on Thursday .
The general public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
The organisers from the automobile Association V@@ D@@ A estimate that approximately 9@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 visitors , similar to 2 years ago , will attend .
R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence on the Serbi@@ an-@@ Hung@@ arian border
The Hung@@ arian police have used tear gas and water cann@@ ons against several hundred angry refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
Eur@@ o@@ n@@ e@@ ws cor@@ respondent D@@ á@@ n@@ iel B@@ o@@ z@@ sik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
He reported by telephone :
A group of refugees broke through the border .
A line of police was formed behind it and behind the police a water cann@@ on stood at the ready .
Between 40 and 50 refugees started to throw stones , sticks and plastic bottles at the officers .
At first the officers used a continuous spray of pepper spray .
Then the police used tear gas .
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees .
This caused the group to break up .
The group has now reluc@@ t@@ antly withdrawn .
A pregnant and obviously injured woman has been carried away from the area .
Children who have inhaled tear gas are screaming .
Other refugees have sl@@ umped down together and are suffering from resp@@ i@@ r@@ atory dist@@ ress .
The press spokesman for the Serbian police also sustained injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
Decision time on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets over two days on Wednesday and Thursday , to take the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade .
A survey of 80 economists poll@@ ed by Reuters found a little over half who only last week thought the Fed would go for it , now think it will hold fire a bit longer and keep rates at the current 0-@@ 0.25 percent range .
It 's a historical event because it 's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero .
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , " said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
The US economy has been performing relatively well , the recovery adding t@@ r@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ons of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation .
However the Fed cannot ign@@ ore the less r@@ o@@ sy global outlook .
It has warned markets to be ready for a hike but indic@@ ations are they also believe the odds are against such a move .
The decision is due to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday .
Delta State University shoo@@ ter left note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Sh@@ annon Lam@@ b wrote a note to say that he was " sorry " for the first murder and wished he " could take it back , " authorities revealed Tuesday .
Police in Gau@@ tier , Mis@@ s. said Lam@@ b , a geograph@@ y and social science education instruc@@ tor at Delta State University , called 911 around 10 a.m .
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone .
Lam@@ b told the disp@@ a@@ t@@ cher that police needed to send officers over to his home .
He said " I shot my wife last night " and also mentioned that there is a " sweet dog " in the house that is " not going to bother anyone " but is likely upset .
Police asked the caller his name , but he didn 't give it .
Lam@@ b did not provide an explanation for the shooting .
When police got to the scene they found the body of Amy P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lam@@ b , 45 , that said : " I am so sorry I wish I could take it back .
I loved Amy and she is the only person who ever loved me .
After writing the note , Lam@@ b drove 300 miles to Delta State where he killed Ethan S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t , a history professor , before eventually taking his own life late Monday as cops closed in .
University President William La@@ Forge said he didn 't know of any conflict between Lam@@ b and S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t but " obviously there was something in Mr. Lam@@ b 's mind . "
Despite reports Monday that Lam@@ b allegedly believed P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss was also roman@@ tically involved with S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t , authorities said Tuesday that there was " no information , no evidence " of a " love triangle . "
P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss was described as a " good person " by Shawn O '@@ Ste@@ en , who said he had been married to her for about seven years .
The two divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O '@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was " devastated . "
He said P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss and her daughter were " absolutely best friends . "
P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss worked an online job from her home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Knowles , identified as a close friend of P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss by the Sun Herald .
Knowles said P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ iss , who had a h@@ o@@ und dog named Ligh@@ t@@ ning , had been dating Lam@@ b for about three years .
" She always wanted to help other people , " Knowles said .
Police said Lam@@ b had p@@ h@@ oned relatives at some point Monday to tell them " he 's not going to jail . "
When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lam@@ b pulled his car over , b@@ ail@@ ed out on foot , ran into the woods and shot and killed himself .
Lam@@ b received a doc@@ tor@@ ate in education from Delta State in the spring of 20@@ 15 , according to his resume posted on the university 's website .

All that stuff sure does take a toll .
Eu@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ ings : Lufthansa r@@ e@@ construc@@ ting group
Lufthansa is planning a major reconstruction of its group .
The Lufthansa group will save half a billion Euro@@ s per year through improvements to the organisation alone .
Reconstruction of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs .
Meanwhile new negotiations are being carried out with the pilots ' union .
Lufthansa is r@@ e@@ organis@@ ing the structure of its business and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eu@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ ings .
The goal of the real@@ ign@@ ment is a contribution to profits of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
Among other things , Lufthansa in the future will have no executive board for the passenger business .
The Eu@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ ings budget airline will instead be developed to become as independent as possible .
In the future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ a@@ d@@ t will be responsible for Eu@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ ings on the management board headed by Car@@ sten Spo@@ h@@ r .
With this new real@@ ign@@ ment Spo@@ h@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ ings , with which the group wants to compete against Ry@@ a@@ n@@ air and E@@ a@@ s@@ y@@ jet in the future .
Up to now the organisation of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been extremely complex .
The airline is consoli@@ dating the passenger airline group , which provides three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion , under one umbrella .
New negotiations with pilots
Following the strike which was h@@ a@@ l@@ ted on legal grounds , negotiations with the pilots ' union C@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ pit ( V@@ C ) in the pay dispute will be resum@@ ed on Thursday .
This was announced by the union .
Under discussion will be the pilots ' retirement scheme .
" In a year with record results predicted " C@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ pit wants to come up with a viable solution as quickly as possible
The conflict between the union and the airline had led to a number of strikes over the past months .
Besides the pilots ' trans@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ onal pension payments , the background is the " Wings " budget concept .
It p@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ es that in the battle against competitive routes Lufthansa out@@ sources to the group 's own budget airline , Eu@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ ings .

Manchester United 's Luke Shaw out for months with double frac@@ ture
Luke Shaw suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg during Manchester United 's Champions League defeat at P@@ S@@ V E@@ i@@ n@@ d@@ h@@ o@@ ven .
While this left the full-@@ back in tears and will rule him out for at least six months , Louis van G@@ a@@ al remains hopeful Shaw could play again this season .
The injury was caused by a reck@@ less tackle from H@@ é@@ ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20@@ -year-old Shaw had burst into the P@@ S@@ V area .
He had nine minutes of treatment on the pitch and required ox@@ ygen before being taken to hospital .
Van G@@ a@@ al said : " He has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . "
He will be trans@@ ferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
It is awful - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18 , has it very difficult and then plays fan@@ tast@@ ically and then this happens .
When it was in the dressing room he had an ox@@ ygen mas@@ k on .
He was crying .
I am not a doctor but when you have a double frac@@ ture it is six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play again this season .
Moreno appeared fortunate to escape a red card and the conc@@ ession of a spo@@ t-@@ kick .
Nic@@ ola R@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ o@@ l@@ i , the referee , did not pen@@ alise the Mex@@ ican .
Van G@@ a@@ al suggested the Italian official had e@@ r@@ red .
You can judge for yourself when I say it is a penalty and a red card .
It was a very bad tackle with two legs .
A t@@ w@@ e@@ et on Shaw 's account read : " Thank you everyone for your messages , words can 't describe how gut@@ ted I am , my road to recovery starts now , I will come back stronger . "
Rel@@ ated : Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw blow in defeat at P@@ S@@ V
The England defen@@ der will have an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France next June .
Philli@@ p C@@ o@@ c@@ u , the P@@ S@@ V coach , said : " It 's a very bad injury . "
If any player goes off with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad about it .
It is never the intention of our players to inj@@ ure an opponent .
Moreno suffered a broken leg when playing for Mexico against Van G@@ a@@ al 's Holl@@ and at the 2014 World Cup .
" He finds it very difficult because the intention was not to inj@@ ure the opponent , and when you hear it is a very bad injury , it 's not good , " C@@ o@@ c@@ u said .
For me it was not possible to see the moment .
The only thing I could see was the ball , which was heading in a different direction , so it looked like he [ Moreno ] touched it , but I couldn 't see the tackle on Luke .
Speaking to S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 , Moreno said : " I know how it feels , I know how difficult such a thing can be .
I feel very bad about it , I am so sorry .
P@@ S@@ V 's A@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ é@@ s Guard@@ ado was also taken to hospital following a challenge by Chris Sm@@ alling .
Su@@ rely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ a@@ x better than this ?
It 's one thing any parent soon lear@@ ns : when your child loves a book , it won 't be long before you know it almost by heart .
Unless , it seems , you are David Cameron .
Asked by a provider of holiday chil@@ d@@ care schemes to name his favourite kids ' book , the prime minister o@@ p@@ ted for The Lor@@ a@@ x , the 1971 environmental f@@ able by Dr Se@@ uss .
It was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message published on the website of the Super@@ Camp@@ s company , continuing : " Fun@@ ny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it 's one I enjoy reading to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we have previously missed . "
All very well , except that the subsequent paragra@@ ph in which Cameron sup@@ posedly describes the plot of the book instead gives a pr@@ é@@ c@@ is of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and detail to pad out the fairly brief original text .
" Set in the walled city of T@@ h@@ need@@ -@@ V@@ ille , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Audrey , by ful@@ filling her wish to see a real tree , " it reads , c@@ h@@ ron@@ i@@ c@@ ling a love interest unknown to Dr Se@@ uss , real name T@@ h@@ e@@ odor Se@@ uss G@@ e@@ i@@ s@@ el , who died in 1991 .
If that wasn 't suspicious enough , Cameron 's submitted text reads in part like a plot summary of the Lor@@ a@@ x film provided on the Internet Movie Dat@@ abase website , which begins : " In the walled city of T@@ h@@ need@@ -@@ V@@ ille , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of his dream girl , Audrey . "
Given he is an avo@@ w@@ e@@ dly hands-on parent , it seems unlikely Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book 's plot , in which a young u@@ n@@ named boy hears how the local environment was devastated by the a@@ v@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ous , t@@ r@@ e@@ e@@ -@@ chopping , t@@ h@@ need@@ -@@ k@@ n@@ itting On@@ ce-@@ ler , despite the protests of the eponym@@ ous Lor@@ a@@ x , a squ@@ at , mou@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ io@@ ed creature who " speaks for the trees . "
Most likely , such a relatively l@@ o@@ w@@ ly PR task would have been out@@ sour@@ ced to an aide , seemingly one who has never read The Lor@@ a@@ x 20 times in a row to a child .
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron 's constitu@@ ency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron 's staff , but had no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly at risk of England o@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ sion but it 's still tough
Taking on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough a@@ s@@ sign@@ ment but after seeing the squad England have selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3-@@ 0 Test series defeat suffered last time does not look on the cards for me .
I wouldn 't rule out an away win , either .
Ala@@ stair Cook 's side may be less experienced than the one three years ago but there are good players of spin in that batting lineup and the collective m@@ i@@ n@@ d@@ set is strong ; they will not carry scars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positi@@ vity .
With the ball , M@@ o@@ een Ali is developing as a spinner and A@@ d@@ i@@ l Rashid , even if he is an unknown quant@@ ity at Test level , represents an attacking option .
Rel@@ ated : Adam Ly@@ th dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex H@@ ales
The decision to o@@ m@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is obviously a tough one for me to analy@@ se as his head coach at Yorkshire .
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cri@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ ters are judged on output .
There were no question marks over Joe Roo@@ t , for example , leading up to the announcement because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selectors .
A couple of half-@@ centuries and Ly@@ th might have seen his run extended but he was in control of his own d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ y .
Hop@@ efully if he pun@@ ches out more runs for Yorkshire another opportunity will come along .
The England head coach , Trevor Bay@@ l@@ iss , praised his attitude even when he was not performing as well as he can and that does not surprise me ; he is a team man above all else .
The question of how long a Test bats@@ man gets to make his mark is a tough one .
Ly@@ th got seven caps - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
Only Comp@@ ton got the chance home and away .
The only gri@@ pe you could have was that England went for Jonathan Tro@@ tt in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that w@@ asted opportunity is in the past now .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a bats@@ man I rate highly .
He is an X@@ -@@ factor cri@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ t@@ er , which we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he made 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch that was doing a bit .
He must at least be a@@ f@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ ded the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course dep@@ end on the make-up of the side in the UAE .
The idea of M@@ o@@ een opening the batting alongside Cook , which would get the extra spinner in while keeping four q@@ u@@ icks , has been floated and it is not something I am against .
I don 't see why a stro@@ k@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ k@@ er cannot bat there and this left-@@ h@@ ander has already shown he is one hell of a cri@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ t@@ er .
M@@ o@@ een may not have done the job for his county , Wor@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ shire , but he has been a N@@ o@@ 3 for them and there is not much difference .
My old team@@ -mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 Tests at first drop before stepping up to open in 2001 .
He p@@ e@@ eled off three centuries immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ a@@ f@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes into the squad as back@@ -up spinner and , in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he has struck me as very impressive young man .
People may look at his raw stat@@ s - aver@@ aging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it 's a pun@@ t but there are not a heap of spinners putting their hands up and selectors have o@@ p@@ ted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour .
Away from the squad , England look to have made a couple of s@@ h@@ r@@ e@@ w@@ d a@@ d@@ d@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ ons to their coaching staff .
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene , the Sri Lanka bats@@ man , as a consultant for the Test matches could be a m@@ a@@ ster@@ stroke .
He is one of the game 's l@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ l@@ iest blo@@ kes , who will bring a wealth of experience having done it in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white-@@ ball leg of the tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless streak into the set@@ up .
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket , be it playing or coaching , and like Mahela has n@@ ous that can be tapped .
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before , can fresh@@ en up a side .
Col@@ ly 's Dur@@ ham team@@ -mate Ben S@@ t@@ o@@ k@@ es is rested for the one-@@ day@@ ers , Roo@@ t was given a similar break against Australia and I for one have no issue with this .
While not everyone will agree , the coaches and selectors do not set the schedule .
And you have to remember , like players , their jobs are dependent on results .
Such decisions are never taken ligh@@ tly .
Bre@@ x@@ it camp might win the day if economy is in dol@@ d@@ r@@ ums by 2017
David Cameron 's half-@@ b@@ aked renegoti@@ ation strategy for keeping Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day that passes , even without the election of g@@ e@@ n@@ ial Jeremy " Is it Yes or No ? " Cor@@ by@@ n to the Labour leadership , or the TU@@ C cutting up rough over Europe on Tuesday .
Foreig@@ ners have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages too .
A European diplomat c@@ h@@ um explained the other day that , sun@@ k in a@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ r@@ ted cris@@ es as the EU is - not all of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain 's self-@@ absorbed agenda of divisive conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes which they mostly don 't want .
In Bri@@ g@@ h@@ ton for its annual b@@ e@@ an , the TU@@ C decided it didn 't want them either if they eroded social protection .
We could even call it Dave and George 's s@@ e@@ l@@ f@@ ie agenda .
PM and chan@@ cell@@ or rock up to sum@@ m@@ its or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local gran@@ d@@ e@@ e , then come home and say they are winning allies for reform .
It 's all about me .
My European pal , who wants an out@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ d-@@ looking Britain inside the EU tent - " Don 't leave us alone with France , " says Berlin - suggests that more short-@@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials in some capitals have got to the point where they don 't care whether we stay or leave .
Angela Merkel , Germany 's cau@@ tiously level@@ -@@ headed chan@@ cell@@ or , is an ally , but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it goes bad for her , as it did for over@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ y@@ ers Thatcher ( 11 years ) , M@@ i@@ t@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ r@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France 's F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ç@@ ois Holl@@ a@@ n@@ de is facing re-election or replacement in 2017 .
He is a fading force too .
Poland may soon have a national@@ istic government of the right , Spain one of the left .
It 's hard to see them breaking a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy might be better spent preventing Scotland leaving the UK - something they don 't want either because most have similar separatist tendencies .
So some such ministers may even be planning to make deliberately unhelpful remarks , S@@ N@@ P-@@ style , during the UK 's 2017 referendum campaign to h@@ a@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my pal suggests .
" The renegoti@@ ation was a fix " and " Britain got nothing of value out of the renegoti@@ ation . "
The Euro@@ p@@ e@@ ans know to their cost how predatory F@@ l@@ e@@ et Street can be and how EU-@@ s@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tic the o@@ lig@@ a@@ r@@ ch press bar@@ ons are , as they were not during the Tony Benn@@ -inspired 1975 referendum which endor@@ sed our 1973 entry by a ratio of 2 : 1 .
They may d@@ i@@ m@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the a@@ r@@ ch Euro@@ -@@ opportun@@ ist , making his name as an " EU straight ban@@ anas " Brussels cor@@ respondent in the early 90s .
For all his f@@ o@@ o@@ l@@ ish@@ ness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were .
They included the med@@ ley of tax-@@ shy ras@@ cals , phone-@@ hacking foreigners and p@@ s@@ e@@ udo non-@@ dom@@ s who own most of our great newspapers .
Ac@@ tually Tony Blair thought much the same about them , but real@@ ised that when you 're in a cage with a r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ y gor@@ illa you have to pass the ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct it from having you for lunch and again for tea .
In fact Miliband was more Bla@@ i@@ r@@ ite than Blair in opposing Cameron 's referendum whe@@ e@@ ze , since Blair had conceded the principle over the EU 's a@@ b@@ o@@ r@@ ted constitution , sun@@ k by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him a get-@@ out card .
The press never f@@ o@@ r@@ gave him that either .
But nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly p@@ at on the back at West@@ minster on Monday - I told him he no longer has time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of re-@@ adopting Neil Kin@@ nock 's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s , a mistake then and now .
It may take time , but he must develop a c@@ o@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ ent strategy to engage with the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew M@@ a@@ r@@ r whose BBC sofa he vac@@ ated on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n 's official position on Europe is what I will kind@@ ly call evolving .
He says he 'd like us to stay in a r@@ e@@ formed EU .
Well , most people outside U@@ k@@ ip 's wo@@ a@@ d@@ -@@ wearing tendency and the wil@@ der sho@@ res of Tory little Eng@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ism can probably say yes to that .
It 's what Hil@@ ary " A B@@ e@@ n@@ n , but not a Benn@@ ite " B@@ e@@ n@@ n said on radio and TV this week as the boy s@@ c@@ out in him struggled not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n 's appointment of abrasive John McDonnell as sha@@ dow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
It reminded me of the 70s , when his old dad struggled on TV to be dis@@ loyal to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary 's struggle was more attractive .
But fighting to stay in " in all circumstances " - B@@ e@@ n@@ n 's phrase - was not what McDonnell was saying , nor what J@@ C told peers and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night , by all accounts .
Whatever the bott@@ o@@ m@@ -up , touch@@ y-@@ feely image Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember , he even touched me - message discipline remains important in the age of 24 / 7 TV and especially in the m@@ a@@ e@@ l@@ strom that is social media , a hot@@ bed of p@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ o@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
It 's fair enough not to give Cameron a free pass on Europe , allowing him to take Labour 's support for granted in the referendum campaign , as McDonnell has said .
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so .
But McDonnell and Cor@@ by@@ n 's basic equ@@ i@@ voc@@ ation about EU membership - consistent with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , anti-@@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of e@@ s@@ o@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ic discussion among lef@@ t@@ w@@ ing dis@@ sidents for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central t@@ e@@ n@@ et of doc@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ al squ@@ abbles .
As with his equ@@ i@@ voc@@ ation over Nato - Tom Watson is a@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ ant that J@@ C won 't campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obli@@ ged to try to make sense of it all for their masters at home .
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they have suspicious voters too - on conc@@ essions to Britain when it may all be poin@@ tless ?
The US is already pretty disappointed with the Br@@ its " f@@ e@@ e@@ b@@ le military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost-@@ cutting Tory government in power , as I was reminded at the launch of something called the British I@@ n@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
Experts critic@@ ise Public Health England e@@ -@@ cigarettes review
Cla@@ ims by a government@@ -f@@ unded agency that e@@ -@@ cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers have said .
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the L@@ anc@@ et in critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in its report on e@@ -@@ cigarettes .
PH@@ E published the " landmark " report last month , describing it as a " comprehensive review of the evidence . "
But several researchers have questioned the r@@ o@@ b@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ ness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
An editorial in the L@@ anc@@ et medical journal last month attacked the " extraordinarily flim@@ sy foundation " on which PH@@ E based its main conclusion .
Writing in the BM@@ J , two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were " built on rock or sand . "
Martin Mc@@ Ke@@ e , professor of European public health at the London School of Hy@@ g@@ i@@ ene and Tropical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of clinical epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : " A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of eff@@ e@@ c@@ tiveness . "
They said the public would expect PH@@ E 's claims that " the current best estimate is that e@@ -@@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking " would be based on a detailed review of evidence and m@@ o@@ d@@ elling .
In fact , it comes from a single meeting of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a multi-@@ criteria decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) model to syn@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ ise their opinions on the h@@ a@@ r@@ ms associated with different nic@@ o@@ tin@@ e@@ -@@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research paper .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose chief executive was reported to have previously received funding from British American T@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o for an independent study .
He also endor@@ sed B@@ AT 's public health credentials in a sustainability report , they said .
One of the 12 people at the meeting declared funding from an e@@ -@@ cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
The rationale for s@@ e@@ l@@ ecting the members of the panel is not provided , but they include several known e@@ -@@ cigarette champions , some of whom also declare industry funding in the paper .
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco lead at PH@@ E .
The research paper produced by the group " t@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ingly conce@@ des " there is a lack of " hard evidence for the h@@ a@@ r@@ ms of most products on most of the criteria , " Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
However , none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PH@@ E report .
Mc@@ Ke@@ e and Cap@@ e@@ well said PH@@ E 's claims that " there is no evidence so far that e@@ -@@ cigarettes are acting as a route into smoking for children or non-@@ smo@@ kers " were premature .
P@@ r@@ o@@ f Kevin Fent@@ on , director of health and w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ being at PH@@ E , said the claims in the BM@@ J had been responded to before .
He said : " E-@@ cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . "
One in two lifel@@ ong smo@@ kers dies from their a@@ d@@ diction .
All of the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e@@ -@@ cigarettes are small by comparison , but we must continue to study the long-term effects .
PH@@ E has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show , especially when there was so much public confusion about the rel@@ ative dangers compared to tobacco .
Nearly 80,000 people a year die of a smo@@ k@@ ing-@@ related illness and smoking costs the NHS £ 2@@ bn a year .
By spelling out clearly the current evidence - that while e@@ -@@ cigarettes are not risk-@@ free , they carry only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are ful@@ filling our national r@@ e@@ mit .
BBC should give up E@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ Enders , says former Channel 4 chief
The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as E@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ Enders and The Voice , saying its commercial rivals would " give their right arm " for hit shows such as the Albert Square s@@ o@@ ap .
Johnson said the lic@@ ence fee should only be used to make the sort of programmes that are not made by other UK broadcast@@ ers .
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to be watched by a smaller audience in tough slots against its rivals " biggest rating shows , and on channels such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
After the BBC 's director general , Tony Hall , said the corpor@@ ation wanted to do more in partnership with other organis@@ ations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 to do a t@@ i@@ e-up with the BBC without success .
" I do struggle with the idea that the BBC commissions and broadcast@@ s programmes that would clearly be shown by u@@ n@@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed rivals , " Johnson told the House of Lords communication committee , as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC .
If you keep the lic@@ ence fee , which I 'm not sure in the medium or long term is a good idea , it should reduce its output at least to programmes that others aren 't making and commissioning .
They broadcast The Voice in a prime slot because they want to gain as broad a support as possible for its future .
The idea that no one else would show that is a jo@@ ke , it 's l@@ u@@ dic@@ r@@ o@@ us , it 's obviously non@@ sense .
Johnson said : " I don 't see why a reg@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ sive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without subsi@@ dy .
The Voice is one , E@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ Enders is another , a@@ d@@ mittedly made in-@@ house .
F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ k@@ ly other channels would give their right arm for it .
I struggle to see how it 's public service broadcasting .
I don 't think that would dimin@@ ish the BBC at all .
Johnson , a serial entrep@@ rene@@ ur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings " because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that is the best way to secure long-term support . "
His comments about the BBC 's most popular shows e@@ c@@ h@@ o those of former Sky executive Tony Ball , who used his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lec@@ ture in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell off shows such as E@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ Enders .
Johnson said the BBC 's more n@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ e public service programmes " go on to BB@@ C@@ 4 where quite often you can 't measure the audience but they ful@@ fil their r@@ e@@ mit and they can argue when they go on their sanc@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ ious missions about just@@ if@@ ying £ 4@@ bn in lic@@ ence fee income , " Well of course , we do all these obscure programmes that no one watched . "
They put them on a slot where no one was ever going to watch them .
On the lic@@ ence fee , Johnson told the committee : " I challenge you to find a more reg@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ sive system in terms of who gets the best value from it .
Of course you all think , we all think , £ 150 a year is great value , but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money I wonder if they do because they don 't consu@@ me a lot of the BBC .
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David El@@ stein , who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday , said the BBC should revise its R@@ e@@ i@@ t@@ h@@ ian mission to " inform , educate and enter@@ tain . "
He said little of the BBC 's output was now formally classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV output and 0.1 % on radio - and it should take a lead from public service broadcast@@ ers in Australia and Canada and change it to " inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . "
On the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the P@@ r@@ o@@ ms , of which he said only a handful were shown on TV , and enter into alli@@ ances with commercial broadcast@@ ers to make them all available to watch online .
'@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics ' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the n@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are blasted with s@@ o@@ n@@ ic pul@@ ses .
Scienti@@ sts have b@@ red worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves .
The tiny n@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ o@@ des change direction the moment they are blasted with s@@ o@@ n@@ ic pul@@ ses that are too high-@@ pitched for humans to hear .
The pul@@ ses work by swit@@ ching on motor n@@ e@@ u@@ r@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry mem@@ bran@@ e channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
Rel@@ ated : Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure , dubbed s@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultr@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ und can be used to a@@ c@@ tiv@@ ate a range of brain , heart and mus@@ cle cells from outside the body .
S@@ r@@ e@@ e@@ kan@@ th C@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ ani , a researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ o@@ l@@ l@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-@@ brain stim@@ ulation , an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pul@@ ses into people 's bra@@ ins to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson 's disease .
N@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ o@@ de worms do not usually react to ultr@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ und , but C@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a flu@@ id containing micro@@ scopic bubbles .
The bubbles , he found , a@@ m@@ p@@ lify the ultr@@ asonic waves which then pass inside the worms .
The a@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ i@@ fied ultr@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ und waves act on structures called T@@ R@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels , found in the mem@@ bran@@ es of some of the worms " cells .
The sound waves make these ion channels open up and a@@ c@@ tiv@@ ate the cells they are attached to , according to a report in Nature Communications .
To make ultr@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ -@@ controlled n@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ o@@ des , C@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carried T@@ R@@ P-@@ 4 ion channels .
When he applied ultr@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ und to the modified creatures , the sound waves were a@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ i@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and trans@@ mitted into the worms , where they switched on the modified motor neurons .
The procedure has some simil@@ arities with o@@ p@@ t@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons on and off with pul@@ ses of light .
But C@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ ani said that s@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over that technique .
Unlike light , which has to be sent down an o@@ p@@ tic f@@ i@@ b@@ r@@ e to the desired location inside the brain , low frequency ultr@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ und waves can pass through tissue u@@ n@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ dered , and so can be sent into the brain from on top of the skull .
" We believe that , using gene therapy and a therap@@ e@@ u@@ tic virus , it may be possible to make target human neurons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultr@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neu@@ r@@ o@@ logical treatments , " said C@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ ani .
Other applications could focus on mus@@ cle cells and insu@@ l@@ i@@ n@@ -@@ producing cells , he added .

The che@@ ery voice and cartoon imag@@ ery leave no doubt that this advert for the world 's biggest arms fair is a sharp spo@@ of , produced for Am@@ nesty International to highlight the British government 's willingness to flo@@ g weapons to repres@@ sive reg@@ imes via the Defence and Security Equ@@ ip@@ ment International 's j@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ o@@ ree at the E@@ x@@ Ce@@ L Centre in London 's Do@@ c@@ k@@ lands .
Rel@@ ated : D@@ SE@@ I weapons fair : author@@ itar@@ ian reg@@ imes desc@@ end on London
But a separate campaign is also leading to many posters c@@ r@@ o@@ pping up at bus stops and on tube trains that require a second glan@@ ce .
" Im@@ port@@ ant announcement , Tra@@ v@@ elling on the D@@ L@@ R from 15th to 18th September ? " reads one , using London Under@@ ground fon@@ ts and branding with the D@@ L@@ R line turning into the image of a tank .
This September , a s@@ warm of arms dealers will be desc@@ ending on the D@@ L@@ R ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms fair .
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited work at the Museum of Cru@@ el Desig@@ ns in Bank@@ sy 's Dis@@ mal@@ and .
A collective called the Special Pat@@ rol Group helped distribute it around London using " Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , " a £ 6 pack of Allen keys which it claims " gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet . "
Transport for London is not a@@ m@@ used by this fl@@ y@@ posting " vand@@ alism . "
One of the spo@@ of ads produced by the Special Pat@@ rol Group collective .
According to Gav@@ in Gr@@ i@@ n@@ don , curator of Cru@@ el Desig@@ ns and a lec@@ turer at the University of Essex , artists are becoming more questioning and seeking to take political work to audiences outside galler@@ ies .
A lot of artists are moving to work with activists within protest movements , real@@ ising they have to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society .
Another of the anti-@@ arms trade posters gre@@ eting commu@@ ters on the tube .
The Am@@ nesty video has been watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by ad agency V@@ CC@@ P working pro bon@@ o , with the graph@@ ic designer and voic@@ e@@ over artist also working for free .
V@@ CC@@ P creative director Matt L@@ e@@ ver was struck by the silence surrounding the advertising of the arms fair - with a blan@@ k space on E@@ x@@ Ce@@ L 's calendar - and thought : " Let 's give them the campaign they are trying to avoid . "
They t@@ o@@ yed with creating a more real@@ istic dodgy corporate advert , but " by r@@ a@@ mm@@ ing it home with bright colo@@ urs and anim@@ ation , it was more arresting . "
" They 've done a fantastic job in helping us raise concerns about the selling of illegal torture equipment at the fair , " says Tom Davies at Am@@ nesty .
What we need now is for the UK government to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our d@@ o@@ o@@ r@@ step .
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms fair comes from inside E@@ x@@ Ce@@ L , where e@@ x@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors flo@@ g fan@@ tast@@ ically e@@ u@@ p@@ h@@ e@@ m@@ istic products .
In a press release , Sa@@ ab revealed an order from the US army for " the s@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ der-@@ launched AT@@ 4@@ CS R@@ S . "
This includes a " unique sha@@ ped@@ -@@ charge w@@ a@@ r@@ head that delivers outstanding b@@ e@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ d-@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ -@@ effects inside the target . "
Whatever that does , it won 't be pleas@@ ant .
Eight gol@@ den rules for living in student halls
It 's been 11 years since I moved into student halls as an obli@@ v@@ i@@ ous 19-year-old , still believing in b@@ e@@ r@@ ets and moral rel@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ m , but it 's only now I recall the strained s@@ miles of those I anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
Most of what I learned can be dist@@ illed into eight simple rules .
Moving into halls can range from mildly ner@@ ve-@@ r@@ a@@ cking to totally terri@@ fying .
It 's temp@@ ting to b@@ a@@ b@@ ble : telling people where you 're from , whether and where you took a gap year , where you stand on Cor@@ by@@ n and why you " hon@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ly neither love nor hate M@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ e because seriously guys it 's just y@@ e@@ ast extract H@@ A@@ H@@ A@@ HA I 'll be in my room . "
Take a breath .
And help others take one too - ask questions and show interest .
It ste@@ ers the conversation and helps you to s@@ c@@ out out the people you like versus those you wouldn 't talk to even if your ey@@ elashes were on fire and they were disp@@ ensing e@@ x@@ ting@@ u@@ ishers .
Give people space .
People 's rooms often mor@@ ph into drinks receptions , movie@@ -@@ night venues and commun@@ al hang@@ out spots , but they 're also where people get dressed and adjust their under@@ wear .
Rel@@ ated : Don 't even think about starting university in a relationship
I@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ts get a raw deal at university .
Your room should be a retreat , yet many halls form an i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ -@@ room@@ -@@ s@@ t@@ rolling culture that 's friendly , social and condu@@ cive to lifel@@ ong f@@ r@@ i@@ end@@ ships .
That can be hell for someone who 's trying to r@@ e@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ ge .
Nothing in the culture allows you to say , " I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but I need you to go away so I can get back the energy I 've expended on i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ acting with you . "
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ a@@ l@@ ising - and maybe text instead of knocking .
Speaking of knocking : do it .
One guy in my student halls had a policy that if a door wasn 't locked he was invited in .
He saw some things .
Make friends through baking .
Since you 're starting u@@ n@@ i at the height of B@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ -@@ Off m@@ a@@ n@@ ia , knocking on people 's doors to intro@@ duce yourself with a plate of brow@@ n@@ ies seems marg@@ inally less w@@ e@@ i@@ rd , less 1950s " Wel@@ come to the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ bour@@ hood , I b@@ aked you something , now smile as I ask you personal questions . "
O@@ f@@ f@@ ering hom@@ emade treats is a great way to make friends .
Your hou@@ sem@@ ates will feel obli@@ ged to chat , and may end up a@@ s@@ soci@@ ating your face with a tast@@ y surprise .
Obviously this is subject to you being a decent b@@ a@@ k@@ er .
P@@ o@@ o@@ r@@ ly-@@ f@@ used lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be a@@ s@@ l@@ e@@ ep when you knock .
Ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student halls .
Obviously nic@@ king some@@ ones chicken is theft , but is taking a drop of milk for your tea stealing ?
Dou@@ ble check with the milk owner .
C@@ h@@ ances are they 'll tell you to help yourself even if they 're see@@ thing inside .
If someone steals your stuff , it 's anno@@ ying and you have my sympath@@ ies - but try to deal with it more m@@ a@@ t@@ urely than my h@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ mate , who tainted her milk with w@@ a@@ s@@ h@@ ing-@@ up liquid to punish those who stole it .
She 's in jail now .
You shouldn 't make noise that keeps people from sleeping or studying .
This isn 't just to be a decent human , but because you are the p@@ r@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ b@@ ial people in glass houses .
A girl on my corridor asked her n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ our if they wouldn 't mind turning down the drum and b@@ ass because it was 3@@ am and she had an exam in the morning .
They responded by turning it up .
When they finally shut up at 5@@ am , she kind@@ ly let them sleep for two hours before bla@@ sting her own music , l@@ o@@ cking her door as she left for her three-@@ hour exam .
W@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ d@@ n 't it be roman@@ tic if your future spouse happened to move into the same hall as you ?
C@@ o@@ n@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ sely , wouldn 't it be knu@@ c@@ k@@ le-@@ bit@@ ingly awk@@ ward if you mist@@ o@@ o@@ k a h@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ mate for your future spouse , hooked up , broke up and had to see them every day and possibly watch them get custody of all your mut@@ ual friends ?
Of course , the heart wants what it wants - but if a hot h@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try to at least talk some sense into your groin .
In the e@@ x@@ hil@@ a@@ r@@ ating moment you real@@ ise someone 's left their keys inside their unlocked room , the line between p@@ ranking and bullying is f@@ i@@ n@@ er than it seems .
A good prank is funny , but takes moments to reverse .
Te@@ ach a valuable and a@@ m@@ using lesson about security by hiding something - but never trash someone 's room with t@@ o@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ pa@@ ste and s@@ h@@ ampo@@ o .
Lo@@ ck their door and put their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the free@@ zer - but don 't Blu@@ -T@@ ack their p@@ o@@ s@@ sessions to the ceiling more than twice .
Ter@@ raced houses for refugees , single parents , low earners
Property entrep@@ rene@@ ur Mark@@ us Gil@@ d@@ ner is building t@@ e@@ r@@ raced houses in the Middle F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ ian town of Eck@@ ental for people who do not have much money .
For example for refugees - but also as a sign : " Not only refugees need accommod@@ ation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes . "
" I am demon@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ating how it is still possible to build econom@@ ically and well n@@ o@@ w@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s , " says the 44@@ -year-old in an interview .
Thousands of refugees are pushing their way onto the housing market .
E@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ p@@ rene@@ ur Marcus Gil@@ d@@ ner believes he knows how quickly econom@@ ical housing can be developed : with this project he is building t@@ e@@ r@@ raced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ d@@ ner , thousands of refugees are coming onto the housing market .
What solution are you offering ?
Mark@@ us Gil@@ d@@ ner : Mass accommod@@ ation in c@@ o@@ n@@ tain@@ ers and gy@@ ms is not sustain@@ able .
Because most of the people will be staying here .
We will also need sufficient housing space to accommodate the influ@@ x of refugees over the next decades .
A totally standard three-@@ sto@@ rey t@@ e@@ r@@ raced house is the solution .
Gil@@ d@@ ner : A t@@ e@@ r@@ raced house needs little space .
It fac@@ ilit@@ ates integration .
It is different when the people are housed in blocks of flat@@ s .
Each of the six houses which are currently being built in the pilot project consi@@ sts of three living units each for four asyl@@ um see@@ kers .
Each living unit has two bedro@@ oms , one bathroom , one kitchen and a lounge .
It 's possible that many refugees will say ; now that peace has returned I 'm going back .
Then the houses can easily be converted for different uses .
What are the costs ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : The price for 160 m ² of living space per house amounts to € 18@@ 4,000 without land .
That is manageable .
Construction took six months .
That is reasonable .
Did building regulations complic@@ ate your plans ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : I carried out my project in accordance with building regulations .
The s@@ word of Dam@@ oc@@ les threatening special building projects , and parking space regulations , always make it complicated .
Sc@@ ary .
It is still assum@@ ed that anyone creating three flat@@ s in a t@@ e@@ r@@ raced house needs at least three parking places .
Except that there is not enough space in towns .
And refugees and asyl@@ um see@@ kers have no cars .
How have residents reacted to your t@@ e@@ r@@ raced house project ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : There were some who accused me of building luxury accommod@@ ation for asyl@@ um see@@ kers .
That is definitely not true .
But aren 't you making the competition for affordable housing worse ?
Gil@@ d@@ ner : The truth is over the last five years we have had a building boom in Germany , but it is luxury accommod@@ ation that has been built , which hardly anybody can afford any longer .
My project gives the message that normal people need housing space too .
Not only refugees need accommod@@ ation , but also single mothers and people on low incomes .
I am demon@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ating how it is still possible to build econom@@ ically and well n@@ o@@ w@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s .
This is what it is about .

i@@ OS 9 : how to get new iPhone operating system , as Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by heading to the Sett@@ ings a@@ p@@ p , tapping " General , " and then s@@ e@@ l@@ ecting " Software Up@@ date . "
If it 's ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
Some have run into problems after that installation , being hit by an error message telling them that " Software update failed . "
To get around that , users are recommended either to wait for the rush to die down , or to try and upgrade through iTunes .
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
That might include del@@ eting a@@ p@@ ps to make space - but Apple has made that less likely by s@@ lim@@ ming down the update , and also easier to do using a special tool that will suggest a@@ p@@ ps to del@@ ete and then re-@@ install them once the process is over .
It 's worth ensuring that your phone is charged or near a char@@ ger while the update happens , so that it doesn 't run out of batter@@ y .
If the charge is too low , Apple won 't let the update go ahead , since the phone dying halfway through could lead to the update breaking .

The world championship run@@ ner@@ -up stressed before the start of the dec@@ i@@ s@@ ive seven overseas races " that I 've got nothing more to lose . "
Before the night race in Singapore this Sunday , 53 points divi@@ de the vice world champion from the tit@@ l@@ e@@ holder and two times champion Hamilton .
The Bri@@ t has already won seven of the 12 races of the season to date and is also starting the floo@@ d@@ lit Grand Pri@@ x in the city state as favourite .
In 2009 and in the preced@@ ing year the 30-@@ year-old Bri@@ t was able to win the race .
Whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have any influence on the Grand Pri@@ x in Singapore is as yet unclear .
A p@@ all of smo@@ g has been hanging over the city for days , caused by fires on the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ bouring island of Sumatra .
Bad Kis@@ singer c@@ h@@ ess club has a prominent member
The " Chess friends of Bad K@@ iss@@ i@@ n@@ gen " c@@ h@@ ess club , founded three months ago , has admitted another member to its ranks , taking the number of members to 19 players .
The new member is business@@ man Paul G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ mann , a passionate c@@ h@@ ess and tennis player , who has stayed in Bad K@@ iss@@ i@@ n@@ gen more than 40 times for s@@ p@@ a treatments .
G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ mann is a holder of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and is a fre@@ eman of the towns of Esp@@ e@@ l@@ k@@ amp and L@@ ü@@ b@@ b@@ e@@ cke .
G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ mann supported the c@@ h@@ ess club in Bad K@@ iss@@ i@@ n@@ gen with a don@@ ation which was accepted by chairman Alfred Klein .
This makes it possible to take on members who cannot afford the membership fee
Youth work and talent searches can also be pursu@@ ed .
G@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ mann wants his membership of the c@@ h@@ ess club as well as his friendly contact with the " R@@ e@@ d-@@ white " tennis club to be seen as an expression of his ties with the s@@ p@@ a town .
Ac@@ c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ o@@ d@@ ation office seeks face-to-@@ face contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ ft retirement centre have group@@ ed together under the mantle of a social foundation and opened a new contact point on Gra@@ f-@@ S@@ t@@ a@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ n@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ g-@@ Plat@@ z .
In addition to o@@ b@@ taining advice it is also possible to participate in courses there .
The social foundation is moving down from the mountain into the town centre .
More prec@@ isely , to Gra@@ f-@@ S@@ t@@ a@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ n@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ g-@@ Plat@@ z .
A new accommod@@ ation office will be opening there shortly .
Here , directly next to the shopping centre , senior citizens and other people seeking advice can with immediate effect receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or the services of nursing and health insurance companies .
With our out@@ patient care service we have for years real@@ ised that family care@@ g@@ i@@ vers are often left alone .
This raises numerous questions .
" Not i@@ n@@ frequently , too , many services provided by insurers are not used because the complexity of the insurance is so difficult to understand , " the new manager , J@@ u@@ t@@ ta W@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ and , who as head of the services division for old people 's welfare is also responsible for the Anton@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ ft and the B@@ ü@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ t@@ al as well as for " A@@ m@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ us " out@@ patient services , explained .
Apart from advice , the new accommod@@ ation office also offers courses in prevention , health and w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ness .
Sal@@ u@@ dis has been taken on board for this .
As a result , additional offerings such as prevention of falls , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapy treatment are also available .
The offers from the senior citizens centre and from Sal@@ u@@ dis comple@@ ment each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis represents prevention , precaution , and rehabilitation .
" The senior citizens ' centre for care and nursing , " is how Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis describes it .
Both managers see the reason behind the opening of the new accommod@@ ation office in the town centre as democratic change ,
as this makes a good dec@@ entr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg essential in the future .
Fur@@ ther@@ more , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( S@@ P@@ D ) under@@ lined at the opening ceremony , the accommod@@ ation office is also dedicated to dealing with the isolation of old people . " There are numerous activities and offers on the programme and these extend invitations to regular social gather@@ ings . "
Thus the social foundation makes a big contribution towards making senior citizens as independent as possible and towards enabling them to live well in their familiar environment .
The accommod@@ ation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and S@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Karl Man@@ g , one of the d@@ o@@ y@@ ens of Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
He died on 5 September at the age of 92 , according to the K@@ ü@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ ler@@ h@@ aus on Tuesday .

Park@@ ing penalty : Tim Wi@@ ese throws money at traffic warden
Ex-@@ foot@@ baller Tim Wi@@ ese attra@@ cts the wrong sort of attention in Bre@@ men
He was once a foot@@ baller but now Tim Wi@@ ese , ex-@@ national g@@ o@@ a@@ l@@ ie for Germany who also played for Bre@@ men and H@@ offen@@ heim , is a wrest@@ ler .
According to him he wanted to put on 30 kg of mus@@ cle mass in the past two years .
On the other hand he hasn 't put on any intellectual weight .
Wi@@ ese was just having his hair cut in the centre of Bre@@ men when outside he saw a traffic warden putting a penalty notice on his white Chevrolet Cam@@ aro .
Wi@@ ese stormed out of the hair@@ dres@@ sers , a@@ b@@ used the officer and threw down the money for the fine at her feet , according to a report in the " B@@ i@@ l@@ d " newspaper .
The accusation has been confirmed by the town of Bre@@ men but it is not yet known what the consequences of this extraordinary incident will be .
" The matter is still being investig@@ ated , " says a spokesperson for the town of Bre@@ men .
Only after that will it be decided whether charges are going to be pressed against Wi@@ ese .

Men set upon 17-year-old Af@@ gan
Police are seeking witnesses to an incident in Bad So@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ -S@@ a@@ l@@ m@@ ü@@ n@@ ster . At about 11.@@ 45 on Friday evening , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ m@@ ü@@ n@@ ster .
According to police one of the group , a 17-year-old Afghan , was walking about five metres behind his friends and called out to them for them to wait for him .
At this point the group were level with the b@@ ft petrol station .
Three people were standing on the petrol station premises .
One of these men shouted at the youth and hit him in the face with his fist .
This broke the victim 's n@@ o@@ se and his n@@ o@@ se b@@ l@@ ed heavily .
One of his two friends ran to him and beg@@ ged the attacker to let the victim go .
The injured young man was taken home by his friends .
The p@@ e@@ r@@ pet@@ rator followed the group to their home in a car and drove past it several times in an o@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ ous manner .
As soon as they could no longer see the car , the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette .
There he was attacked again by his original attacker and another male .
Using a club , they beat the victim in the face and upper leg .
The injured man had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
Up to now there is only a vague description of the perpetrators .
One was a man of about 5ft 11@@ in tall .
The second attacker was about 5ft 5@@ in tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt .
Police are asking any possible witnesses to contact them by telephone on 0@@ 0@@ 49 6@@ 18@@ 1 100 123 .
Dr Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler takes over F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen practice and invest@@ s € 3@@ 10,000
Syl@@ via M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler-@@ G@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ oll and Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler ( from left ) take over practice from Kar@@ l-@@ Hein@@ rich and Ur@@ s@@ e@@ l F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen .
The mayor of the joint community , Bern@@ d Bor@@ mann , business sponsor U@@ ta S@@ e@@ i@@ m@@ -@@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ dorf 's mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are del@@ igh@@ ted at this turn of events .
Many areas in the country have no doctor - A@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ dorf by contrast is fortunate : on 1 October Dr Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler is taking over the F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen practice .
While Ur@@ s@@ e@@ l F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen is retiring , her husband Kar@@ l-@@ Hein@@ rich will spend the next few months working part-time with his successor .
Dr M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler r@@ e@@ opens the practice on 12 October after a period of renovation ; by then he will have invested € 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at S@@ t@@ .@@ -@@ M@@ a@@ r@@ cell@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ asse 6 .
When the F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ens met Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler and his wife Dr Sil@@ via M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler-@@ G@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ oll , who at the time were finishing their r@@ e@@ s@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ cies in V@@ e@@ r@@ den hospital and also wanted to take on a practice in the next few years , they liked each other immediately
" It was always in the back of our minds that the M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers would fit into this practice well , " says Dr Ur@@ s@@ e@@ l F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen and laugh@@ s .
" When we were ready , I simply called them up . "
The M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ dorf in the future .
" The proxim@@ ity and the continuous contact with the patients are attractive to us , " says 39@@ -year-old M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler .
" We want to get to know the families and support them over the years . "
He also sees being his own boss as a benefit .
And so it was agreed that the M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers would buy the house with the practice .
However in the meantime they are living in Bru@@ c@@ h@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ -@@ Vil@@ sen .
F@@ ather of two Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler also grew up there and after his medical studies in Han@@ over he worked in a number of medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ i@@ n@@ gen , Ni@@ enburg und R@@ o@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ b@@ u@@ r@@ g .
He is currently working as a consultant in Sul@@ i@@ n@@ gen , fur@@ ther@@ more he was appointed chief emergency doctor in the county of Die@@ p@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ z in 2009 and was involved on a voluntary basis in the blood don@@ ation service in Bru@@ c@@ h@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ -@@ Vil@@ sen .
From 19 September the practice will be preparing for the new boss .
While surgeon Dr Kar@@ l-@@ Hein@@ rich F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen worked as a general pra@@ ctition@@ er , his wife Ur@@ s@@ e@@ l ( a specialist in internal medicine ) speci@@ alised in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology .
The M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers , both specialists in internal medicine , wanted to establish themselves as general pra@@ ctition@@ ers .
" So it 's out with the endo@@ s@@ c@@ opy , " says 38@@ -year-old Syl@@ via M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler-@@ G@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ oll .
After the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
We will offer more ultr@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ und exam@@ inations as well as long-term and stress EK@@ Gs and we need one more consulting room .
The IT system will also be completely renewed .
The M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers are receiving a grant tot@@ alling € 50,000 as part of a funding programme from the county ( € 2,500 ) as well as from the joint community ( € 12,@@ 500 ) and the local authority ( € 12,@@ 500 ) .
" This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will carry on , " stressed the mayor of the joint community Bern@@ d Bor@@ mann .
According to Syl@@ via M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler-@@ G@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ oll , some 2,000 patients visit the F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen practice every quarter ; in north Germany the average practice sees about 500 .
There is another G@@ P practice in A@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ dorf .
Frank M@@ ü@@ l@@ ler says that there is another side benefit of their taking over the practice : according to Ur@@ s@@ e@@ l F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen , the chem@@ ist will stay in A@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ dorf .
If they hadn 't found any successor , it would have closed down .
Anyone visiting the M@@ ü@@ l@@ lers ' surgery will also first of all see familiar faces : they are taking over the seven medical assi@@ s@@ t@@ ants and the cle@@ a@@ n@@ er from the F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ens .
With their leaving , an era ends in A@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ dorf ; after all the doctors have had their practice there for 30 years .
" We started with only two rooms , " remembers Ur@@ s@@ e@@ l F@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sen with a g@@ r@@ in .
After such a long time she feels a little wist@@ ful .
" But we 'll still be living in H@@ o@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ m@@ o@@ or and I 'm sure we will be seeing many of our patients often , " says the internal medicine specialist .
Her husband adds with a smile , " We 've got a 6000 m ² garden . "
" Up to now I haven 't done much gar@@ dening , that might change now . "
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy trav@@ elling .
Croatia : " We are letting the refugees through "
" Border control is being brought in now on our southern border too , " says Interior Minister Johann@@ a Mi@@ k@@ l@@ -@@ L@@ e@@ i@@ t@@ ner .
In parallel , checks on the Hung@@ arian border remain in place .
It is still a priority that anyone wanting to claim asyl@@ um can " of course " do so .
The care and safety of people is p@@ a@@ r@@ amount .
It is equally clear " that obvious signals are needed , " says the minister .
People must know that we do not accept an unlimited flow of mig@@ ration , and not over the A@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ -S@@ l@@ o@@ ven@@ ian border either .
A controlled procedure is required
Croatia is considering a " corridor " - Slo@@ ven@@ ia has refused .
The Croatian government had earlier announced that Slo@@ ven@@ ia also wanted to let incoming refugees travel through towards Austria and Germany , and also potentially establish corri@@ dors for the refugees .
However , Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ö@@ r@@ k@@ ö@@ s Z@@ n@@ i@@ d@@ ar in La@@ ib@@ ach did not see it in quite the same light .
The idea of corri@@ dors is " absolutely unacceptable , " Slo@@ v@@ e@@ i@@ n@@ a intends rather to step up its surveillance of the borders - especially the border to Hung@@ ary .
The border with Croatia , as the external border to the S@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ gen area , is however already heavily controlled .
But as the Minister stressed , Slo@@ ven@@ ia is not suggesting sealing its borders for refugees .
" Every member of the EU has to ful@@ fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , " stressed Gy@@ ö@@ r@@ k@@ ö@@ s Z@@ n@@ i@@ d@@ ar .
According to the Croatian government , the first refugees attempted to enter Eastern Croatia on Monday night over the T@@ o@@ var@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing , in order to avoid regist@@ ration .
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby m@@ a@@ ize field .
Since then , according to local media , police vehicles are const@@ antly coming across new refugees in Croatian T@@ a@@ v@@ a@@ r@@ nik .
They are mostly Syrian and Af@@ ghans , among them many women and children .
The emergency s@@ e@@ vic@@ es and the Red Cross are also already in place .
Interior Minister R@@ a@@ n@@ k@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic says that his country is expecting around 4@@ 000 refugees in the next few days .
In addition it was reported by both Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday that buses from P@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ vo on the Mac@@ e@@ d@@ oni@@ an-@@ Serbian border , which have up to now taken mig@@ rants to the Hung@@ arian border , are being diver@@ ted to Croatia
The government in Bel@@ grade denied , however , that it is the case that they are giving people instructions to take certain routes . " We neither can nor want to do that , " they stated .
According to media reports , at least one bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the early hours , and in the course of the day more buses are expected .
Over Croatia , Slo@@ ven@@ ia and Austria to Germany
The detainees were trav@@ elling the entire night through Serbia from the Mac@@ e@@ d@@ o@@ n@@ ian border , about 500 kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ res away .
" We heard that Hung@@ ary is closed , so the police said we should come here , " said one of the refugees .
They wanted to go through Croatia , Slo@@ w@@ e@@ n@@ ia and Austria to get to Germany .
This imp@@ lies that a shift in the former Bal@@ k@@ an route through Turkey , Gre@@ ece , Mac@@ edonia , Serbia and Hung@@ ary to a route somewhat further to the west , which observers have already predicted , could actually now be happening .
Croatia : " W@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ ad options for border control "
Croatian Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has already prepared appropriate plans for potential exc@@ e@@ p@@ tional situations in the event of a large influ@@ x of refugees .
He gave no details , but he indicated that Croatia , as a non-@@ member of the S@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ gen Treaty , has " widespread options for border control . "
Rig@@ orous checks are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the S@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ gen area .
Slo@@ ven@@ ia has been a member since 2007 , since when its EU partners have presented a consistently good report on the country as far as border controls are concerned .
There are also some 300 refugees stuck on the Serbian side behind the Hung@@ arian border fence .
According to media reports from Bel@@ grade , they spent the past night at the Hor@@ gos border crossing , which leads to R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
The Hung@@ arian authorities claim that both the Hor@@ gos and the Back@@ i Bre@@ g border cross@@ ings also remain completely closed .
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still not clear .
At a local appearance on Wednesday morning , the Serbian Interior Minister , N@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ j@@ sa Ste@@ fan@@ ovic , tried to reassure people : he considers the debate on the refugees ' alternative routes after the closure of the Hung@@ arian border to be premature .
At the moment there is not a large number of refugees involved .
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey over Hung@@ ary , Croatia or another country .
Aid workers adv@@ ise mig@@ rants to take - dangerous - alternative routes .
But private Hung@@ arian aid workers have already started to distribute maps marked with alternative routes through Croatia to refugees
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is however not without danger : in parts of the border region , even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still u@@ n@@ cleared m@@ i@@ n@@ ef@@ i@@ e@@ l@@ ds .
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of m@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ers has been sent to the border region .
Stock exchange h@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ er : U@@ k@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ians pay $ 30 million
Sup@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ k belon@@ ged to a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who since 2010 have repeatedly been accused of providing inside views of as yet u@@ n@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wir@@ e , Market@@ w@@ i@@ red and PR Newswire .
The information provided enab@@ led insi@@ der dealing on the financial markets .
By this means , according to investigators , a total of over $ 100 million was s@@ c@@ a@@ m@@ med .
" Current information indic@@ ates that even those outside our national borders have finally been caught , " an SEC report states .
P@@ r@@ o@@ ce@@ e@@ d@@ ings against 32 other suspects in this case are continuing .
Most of the accused come from the Ukraine and Georgia .
The perpetrators were operating out of both the USA and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ e@@ n@@ ical H@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ ice Care celeb@@ rates 20 years in Mann@@ heim
Business rules around the P@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ plat@@ z in Mann@@ heim
People carry out their e@@ r@@ r@@ ands , some of them walking b@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ k@@ ly , some of them s@@ t@@ rolling along in a l@@ e@@ i@@ s@@ urely fashion .
They head for the two bran@@ ches of the Mann@@ heim car show@@ room .
Tra@@ ms stop .
Pul@@ sing , v@@ i@@ b@@ rant life in the brilliant autum@@ n sun@@ s@@ h@@ ine , and right in the middle are four big black@@ boards each bearing the words , " Before I die I want to ... "
The E@@ cum@@ e@@ n@@ ical H@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ ice Care organisation is carrying out this campaign to raise awareness of their 20th anniversary , and is e@@ n@@ counter@@ ing extremely mixed reactions .
" It 's about life , which is why we are carrying out this campaign in the middle of the town , right among the people , " says Jo@@ s@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
The head of E@@ cum@@ e@@ n@@ ical H@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ ice Care is also available to answer questions from and have discussions with p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ s-@@ by , as are voluntary workers .
While many p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ s-@@ by impul@@ sively grab the chal@@ k and complete the sentence with " a@@ f@@ f@@ irm my life , " " be able to read , " " drive through the USA in a camp@@ er van , " " stop war " or " not suffer for long , " others stop briefly , read , say things like " I 'm not ready for that yet , " and carry on .
Again and again little discussions develop in cor@@ ners about the campaign itself , about life , about dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ ü@@ b@@ inger is also there now .
" It 's only when I consider that some day the end of this world is going to come for me that I can live r@@ e@@ spon@@ sibly , " says the Director of the Protestant social charity D@@ i@@ a@@ k@@ o@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ chen Wer@@ k in Mann@@ heim , which is a responsible body along with the Car@@ i@@ t@@ as Association for E@@ cum@@ e@@ n@@ ical H@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ ice Care .
Which is why these high visibility campaigns are good for the 20@@ -year-old organisation .
Of course it 's under@@ stand@@ able that not everyone wants to share their message publicly on the black@@ boards ; in the end it 's a very personal matter .
The top@@ ics of life and death are still ste@@ e@@ p@@ ed in t@@ a@@ b@@ o@@ o@@ s , according to Jo@@ s@@ e@@ fine Lam@@ mer 's experience , although the hosp@@ ice movement even over the last few years has done much to help people to accept it .
A perception shared by Angel@@ i@@ k@@ a Go@@ def@@ r@@ o@@ id .
The volunteer worker , who helps people to deal with death and grief , has been with the organisation from the start .
Having been confron@@ ted with personal experiences of these issues she read a lot of literature and decided she wanted to get involved in helping people who are dying .
When the E@@ cum@@ e@@ n@@ ical H@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ ice Care organisation appe@@ aled for volunteer helpers , she signed up immediately and was with them when they started up in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ r@@ o@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who help those people affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , care homes and in the San@@ kt V@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ ent H@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ ice .
They are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ i@@ k@@ a Go@@ def@@ r@@ o@@ id is particularly well suited to handling this job and the experiences and everything it e@@ n@@ t@@ ails .
" I see life from a different point of view , I believe it is precious and I sei@@ ze the moment , " she says .
The out@@ patient services offered by the E@@ cum@@ e@@ n@@ ical H@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ ice organisation are free of charge and d@@ e@@ n@@ o@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ ationally independent .
Financial support from health insurance companies and donations by members enable education as well as training sessions , and training and super@@ vision for p@@ alli@@ ative care providers and grief counsell@@ ors .
Training for new staff is offered every two years .
The black@@ boards , with the messages written on them on Saturday , are now on display in the E@@ van@@ g@@ e@@ l@@ ical church ( M@@ 1 , 1@@ a ) and the Catholic church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
Anyone who wants to can also write their own personal wishes on post@@ cards there .
Fed@@ E@@ x earnings mixed , l@@ o@@ wers fiscal 20@@ 16 outlook
Fed@@ E@@ x reported disappointing results for its latest quarter , and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast on weaker demand for fre@@ ight services and higher costs in its ground division .
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seas@@ onal workers for the holidays .
At this time last year , Fed@@ E@@ x announced it would hire 50,000 seas@@ onal workers for the holidays .
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in p@@ r@@ e@@ market trading 45 minutes ahead of Wednesday 's opening bell .
Fed@@ E@@ x Corp. said that it expects to earn between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 for the fiscal year that ends next May , down 20 cents from an earlier prediction .
Analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 , according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set .
The reduced outlook comes despite rate hik@@ es aver@@ aging 4.9 percent , which will take effect Jan. 4 , and higher s@@ u@@ r@@ charges for ground ship@@ ment of heavy or large pack@@ ages , which begin in November .
The company said it still expects earnings to grow over the previous year because of cost-@@ cutting , higher revenue and growth in online commer@@ ce .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was " performing soli@@ dly given weak@@ er-@@ than-@@ expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . "
The h@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ day@@ -h@@ iring plans were announced a day after rival U@@ P@@ S said that that it plans to hire 90,000 to 95@@ ,000 extra workers , about the same that it hired last year .
In the quarter that ended Aug. 31 , Fed@@ E@@ x earned $ 69@@ 2 million , up 6 percent from a year earlier .
Earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 , short of the $ 2.@@ 44 per share average forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
Revenue rose 5 percent , to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
Six analysts surveyed by Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ E@@ x has been hit in recent years by a decline in priority international shi@@ pping , which has caused revenue in its E@@ x@@ press unit to stag@@ n@@ ate .
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at Fed@@ E@@ x Ground .
In the latest quarter , ground revenue rose 29 percent but operating income was basically flat on higher costs for larger pack@@ ages and self-@@ insurance .
The express unit saw higher income because of higher base rates , while income fell in the fre@@ ight business on higher labor costs .
In p@@ r@@ e@@ market trading about an hour before the opening bell , Fed@@ E@@ x shares were down $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0@@ .@@ 15 .
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
At their most anticipated meeting in years , Federal Reserve policy@@ makers will spend two days this week seated around a 27-@@ foot Hon@@ d@@ u@@ r@@ an m@@ a@@ h@@ o@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ y table deci@@ ding if it 's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade .
Lo@@ o@@ m@@ ing over them at one end of the central bank 's o@@ r@@ n@@ ate , two-@@ story b@@ o@@ a@@ r@@ dro@@ om will be a mur@@ al of the United States .
The map is a reminder that Fed Cha@@ i@@ r@@ woman Janet L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation 's economic interests above all others .
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress : maxim@@ ize U.S. employment and keep prices here stable .
But since the Great Rec@@ ession , Fed leaders have acknowledged that there 's an u@@ n@@ written third mand@@ ate : financial stability .
And that third mand@@ ate could be the X@@ -@@ factor in a too-@@ close@@ -to-@@ predict decision , to be announced Thursday , about whether the U.S. economy is ready to start being w@@ e@@ a@@ n@@ ed from the unprecedented stim@@ u@@ l@@ us provided by the near-@@ zero short-term interest rate in place since late 2008 .
Even though most data show the economy growing soli@@ dly , the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already-@@ cautious Fed officials s@@ k@@ i@@ t@@ t@@ ish about adding to the volatility by raising their benchmark federal funds rate - even by no more than a mere quarter of a percentage point .
" Obviously the labor market and inflation is going to be first and fore@@ most the most important thing they watch , " said Lindsey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , chief economist at brokerage firm Sti@@ f@@ el Nic@@ o@@ l@@ aus & Co .
" But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global marketplace is enough to provide them with just@@ ification to wait further , " she said .
There 's no consensus about what the Fed will do , which in itself is causing financial market jit@@ ters .
About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate increase this week .
Financial markets , however , are expecting the Fed to hold off , with a key indicator showing only about a 30 % chance of a boost .
That would point to a stock market drop if the Fed raises the rate , unless policy@@ makers were to soften the blow by promising that another increase would be a ways off .
On Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points , or 1.4 % , to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policy@@ makers will hold the rate steady this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief economist at Moo@@ dy 's Capital Markets Research Group .
" It would be a surprise if the Fed hik@@ ed rates at this point in time , " he said .
If Fed policy@@ makers did , " they would have to go to great leng@@ ths in their policy statement to hold financial markets ' hands so they don 't panic . "
Other experts argued that a rate increase would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act .
Just a month ago , the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage point this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would vali@@ date the strength of the U.S. recovery .
Y@@ ellen had said through the spring and early summer that she expected a rate increase this year despite complaints from liber@@ als that more economic progress was needed .
Although job creation s@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed in August , labor market growth has been solid this year .
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers to be full employment .
W@@ age gains have shown signs of pic@@ king up .
And although inflation continued to run below the central bank 's annual 2 % target , Fed policy@@ makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices .
The economy " can cope with higher rates , and needs them , given the tigh@@ tness of the labor market , " said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ r@@ o@@ economics .
But financial markets around the world started conv@@ u@@ l@@ sing late last month after China d@@ e@@ valued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 16 % below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth .
The market has rebounded somewhat this month , with the Dow now down nearly 10 % from the May high .
For Fed policy@@ makers , the market turmoil adds to the complex calcul@@ us of when to raise the interest rate .
" A@@ b@@ sent what happened in financial markets and the news about the weakness in the Chinese economy over the past couple weeks , they would be tightening at this meeting , " said Stephen D. O@@ liner , a senior research fellow at the UCLA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official .
Now , he predic@@ ts they 'll wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects .
" There 's a lot of uncertainty about what the imp@@ acts on the U.S. economy are going to be , and they have almost no data to rely on that post-@@ dates the developments in China , " O@@ liner said .
The health of the global economy isn 't one of the Fed 's primary concerns , so techn@@ ically it shouldn 't be fac@@ t@@ o@@ red into its dec@@ ision@@ -making .
But , in effect , the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world .
The central bank 's influence in recent years has been enormous .
The mere h@@ i@@ n@@ t by then-@@ Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 20@@ 13 that the Fed might " t@@ aper " its monetary expansion triggered market conv@@ u@@ l@@ sions around the globe .
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ w@@ ined , Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere but also to consu@@ l@@ t with other central bankers and experts to get a better read on the global economy .
Its dec@@ ision@@ -making process is " more art than science , " said Z@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ ary Kar@@ a@@ b@@ ell , head of global strategy for wealth@@ -@@ management firm E@@ n@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ er , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , Va . , noted this month that " the Fed has a history of over@@ r@@ e@@ acting to financial market movements that seem u@@ n@@ connected to economic fundam@@ entals . "
L@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ er , a voting member of the policy@@ making Federal Open Market Committee who has been pushing for a rate increase , cited decisions in 199@@ 8-@@ 99 as an example .
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage point over three meetings " despite limited identifi@@ able implications for U.S. growth , " L@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ er said .
A year later , Fed officials reversed those cuts .
The Fed should put financial stability concerns first only during a major crisis , such as the 2008 market meltdown , said Adam S. P@@ o@@ sen , a former member of the Bank of England 's rat@@ e@@ -@@ setting committee .
The latest turmoil doesn 't come close to that level , he said .
" You certainly don 't want to be put in a situation of being scared of a rate hike because markets got upset , " said P@@ o@@ sen , president of the Peterson Institute for International Econom@@ ics .
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mand@@ ate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don 't think they should get ahead of the curve .

H@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ r@@ swer@@ da : a bit of help for refugees
These days more and more refugees are arriving in Germany .
To prepare a warm welcome for them is not just a matter of the commitment of countless voluntary helpers .
In H@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ r@@ swer@@ da there is also a whole range of people who u@@ n@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ fish@@ ly support asyl@@ um see@@ kers in the town .
Among these are Petra und Kl@@ aus H@@ e@@ i@@ n@@ e .
Petra H@@ e@@ i@@ n@@ e is a dedicated teacher .
Even at 74 she still loves teaching .
Every Thursday she goes to the refugee centre on D@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ inger S@@ t@@ ras@@ se .
There she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
Of course these lessons are very different from those at a proper school .
Brazil 's Pediatric Society of Rio Gran@@ de Promo@@ tes Health@@ y Bre@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ feeding Die@@ ts
Braz@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ an pediatric organization S@@ P@@ R@@ S has come up with a sho@@ cking way to try and get women to understand the importance of good nutrition while bre@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ feeding , by featuring images of babies s@@ u@@ c@@ k@@ ling from bre@@ asts painted with depic@@ tions of u@@ n@@ healthy food .
Human breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins , fats , vit@@ amins , and car@@ bohydr@@ ates , which give babies all the nut@@ r@@ i@@ ents they need to grow a strong imm@@ une system .
Due to excess energy requirements , pregnant women and new mom@@ s are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie i@@ n@@ take by about 500 calories per day .
However , new research suggests that increasing cal@@ orie i@@ n@@ take is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make .
A recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , a professor at the Bay@@ l@@ or College of Medicine in Texas revealed that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from developing tumors .
Unfortunately , u@@ n@@ healthy diets were found to neg@@ atively affect the child 's imm@@ une system .
E@@ x@@ cep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
Bern@@ ried district council has approved the planning application for the € 2.@@ 3 million sports hall .
And it is making an exception .
The roof may be flat@@ ter to accommodate a solar energy system .
Pl@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ ing for the long-@@ awaited sports building on the Bern@@ ried sports ground are moving ahead step by step : in the latest council meeting the planning application was approved unanimously without any great discussion .
The committee had earlier agreed , among other things , to an " exception , " or rather an " e@@ x@@ emp@@ tion " under building law to the app@@ lic@@ able building plan .
The " exception " refers to permission for a special shape for the roof structure .
According to this a " g@@ able roof with an off-@@ centre r@@ i@@ dge and roof over@@ hang " will be construc@@ ted .
The background for the plan is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels . " This means we will have a won@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ fully large sou@@ th-@@ facing roof , " explained mayor Josef S@@ t@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ ger at the meeting .
The " e@@ x@@ emp@@ tion " on the other hand refers to the roof pitch , which for energy reasons - contr@@ ary to the s@@ t@@ ip@@ u@@ l@@ ations in the development plan - will be less than 10 degrees .
This will reduce the volume of the hall .
Ther@@ e@@ fore an " e@@ x@@ emp@@ tion " is necessary , since the development plan allows no " exc@@ e@@ p@@ tions " with regard to roof pitch - while the Bern@@ ried council as a rule has a more restri@@ ctive approach to requests for e@@ x@@ emp@@ tions .
The sports hall is however more of a recurring project . " We are not setting a preced@@ ent with this , " says S@@ t@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ ger .
The hall at the sports centre is a joint project between the district and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
Costs have been calculated at around € 2.@@ 3 million .
C@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ b@@ u@@ tions are expected through funding from schools and popular sports .
In the next step of the project , the planning application for the 18 x 36 met@@ re hall will be presented to the district administration for review .
Pe@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ berg Clin@@ ic moves to S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u .
The Pe@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ berg Hospital is closing earlier than planned - in 20@@ 16 .
At the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u Hospital .
The wards and the majority of employees are moving to S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u from Pe@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ berg .
This allows for the district 's limited company hospital 's surprising plans , confir@@ ms district administ@@ rator Andrea Jo@@ c@@ h@@ ner@@ -@@ Weiss .
The Board of Directors , however , will come to a decision about this and they meet next Wednesday , 23 September .
If these plans are implemented , then all the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pe@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ berg will remain in employment .
The vast majority will move with Fischer and the internal medicine ward that still continues to exist to S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u .
The premises are available .
Those employees who are not able to go to S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u will be offered positions in We@@ i@@ l@@ heim , according to Jo@@ c@@ h@@ ner@@ -@@ Weiss .
Emplo@@ yees have been informed about the plans .
The changes were triggered by the resignation of Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has been clinical director of the S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital .
When the question of who his successor should be , according to Jo@@ c@@ h@@ ner@@ -@@ Weiss , the name of " Fischer , " who had declared that he was prepared to take over leadership from 1 October and move with his team to S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u , was raised .
For the S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u hospital , these changes mean an " upgrade " and an expansion of the services offered in the field of internal medicine , says Jo@@ c@@ h@@ ner@@ -@@ Weiss .
Fisher is a specialist in cardiac pac@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ k@@ ers and defi@@ b@@ r@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ators .
S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u ( 180 beds ) speci@@ a@@ l@@ ises in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological disorders in its internal medicine department .
In the trans@@ ition@@ ary period over the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Board of Management agrees to this , will run both e@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ b@@ l@@ ish@@ ments , and in the next year the former miners ' hospital in Pe@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ berg , which still has over 35 beds , will finally be closed after almost 140 years .
Thus far the district has planned this for 20@@ 18 , when the currently ongoing restor@@ ation of the We@@ i@@ l@@ heim hospital is finished .
District administ@@ rator Jo@@ c@@ h@@ ner@@ -@@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Board of Management , contra@@ dic@@ ts rumours that the building , which is owned by the Federal Association for Miners , will in the future be used as accommod@@ ation for asyl@@ um see@@ kers .
" I can rule that out . " What will happen to the building , Jo@@ c@@ h@@ ner@@ -@@ Weiss cannot say ; that needs more consideration .
At the moment a Car@@ i@@ t@@ as short-term care facility and a day@@ time psych@@ iatric facility are housed there .
" It 's the best thing that could have happened for us ; we won 't get this sort of opportunity again , " says Fischer about the move to the L@@ e@@ ch , which has been accepted " positi@@ vely and with understanding " by employees .
Real prospects for the building where Fischer has worked for over 30 years as chief physician do not really exist .
He was asked by his colleagues at S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ ga@@ u to take over the post of medical director .
The Pi@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ berg hospital , which once had 100 beds , has been const@@ antly under threat of closure over the last decades . D@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ m@@ ents have been closed , for example surgery and obstetri@@ cs .
The hand@@ ball@@ ers of R@@ h@@ e@@ i@@ n@@ -@@ N@@ e@@ c@@ k@@ ar L@@ ö@@ w@@ en are being challenged this evening ( 8 : 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ i@@ s@@ cher H@@ C .
The leaders of the B@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ lig@@ a are the clear favour@@ ites in W@@ up@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ tal , however there are no grounds for arro@@ gance .
In the past season the Baden team suffered a painful defeat at B@@ H@@ C and they have some ground to make up there .
Two injured in hunting accident near P@@ rat@@ au
Two t@@ r@@ a@@ ctor drivers were seriously injured when they were shot during the m@@ a@@ ize harvest on Tuesday after@@ noo@@ on .
A number of hun@@ t@@ s@@ men were in action on a corn field near P@@ rat@@ au ( Wit@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ b@@ u@@ r@@ g district ) during the harvest , according to police .
After shots were fired , two men , one 63 and the other 22 , suffered severe injuries and were taken to hospital .
The precise cause of the accident was initially unclear .
Criminal investigators are trying to determine the details .
Missing 16-year-old from R@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ l@@ and-@@ Pal@@ a@@ t@@ ine the victim of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of a 16-year-old from R@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ l@@ and-@@ Pal@@ a@@ t@@ ine who has been missing since Saturday .
When questioned the 20@@ -year-old admitted to having killed the teenager and thrown her body into a can@@ al in Rock@@ e@@ n@@ hausen .
Six@@ t@@ e@@ e@@ n@@ -@@ year-old missing from R@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ l@@ and-@@ Pal@@ a@@ t@@ ine since Saturday is the victim of a violent crime .
The body of a young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ e@@ n@@ hausen near Ka@@ i@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n the public prosecutor 's office and police reported on Wednesday .
A 20@@ -year-old suspect , who confessed to the crime and led investigators to the site where the body was found , was arrested also on Tuesday evening .
The 16-year-old was reported as missing Sunday morning when she did not return home as agreed after attending an autum@@ n party in Rock@@ e@@ n@@ hausen .
In their search for the young woman , investigators initially found personal items belonging to the victim .
I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ views with the missing girl 's circle of friends and acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ tan@@ ces ultimately resulted in 20@@ -year-old becoming a suspect .
The p@@ r@@ e@@ sum@@ ed p@@ e@@ r@@ pet@@ rator then led the police to a can@@ al in Rock@@ e@@ n@@ hausen , where the body was found .
Under interrogation the arrested man confessed the police that he had killed the 16-year-old and thrown her body in the can@@ al .
The 20@@ -year-old will be brought before the magistrate on Wednesday ; investigators have reduced the charge to one of manslaughter .
Further investigation is being carried out regarding details of the exact circumstances of the crime
Refugees need accommod@@ ation : study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense
And more and more refugees are seeking an affordable place to stay .
Pres@@ sure on the housing market is growing .
Social housing is facing a challenge .
The struggle for a@@ l@@ locations in the German housing market began long ago .
With the arrival of refugees and job see@@ kers from the EU , more and more people are crow@@ ding into a market which in many large towns is already over@@ b@@ u@@ r@@ dened .
They are competing with residents on low incomes for the last affordable homes .
To supply the demand for affordable homes , 400,000 new units must be built every year up to 2020 .
This is the conclusion reached by a study c@@ o@@ m@@ mission@@ ed by the " Social Housing " federation of associations .
In comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units were completed in this year in Germany .
This amounts to a short@@ fall of 14@@ 0,000 homes .
After the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obli@@ ged to live as asyl@@ um see@@ kers in initial reception accommod@@ ation .
Many then push onto the housing market and stand in long queu@@ es in front of rental flat@@ s .
According to the German Federal S@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ical Office , however , in the last year fewer than half of all asyl@@ um see@@ kers have lived as tenants .
The negative development in the housing market , however , is not just due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
The study points to significant fail@@ ings in housing policy over the last year .
Germany has a housing deficit which increases every year .
There is a current short@@ fall in urban areas of around 7@@ 70,000 living units lam@@ ents Mat@@ thi@@ as G@@ ü@@ n@@ ther , author of the study .
This is why many professionals in large towns are forced to live in flat shares .
Due to the slump in the housing market , young adults of necess@@ ity live longer in " Hotel M@@ ama . "
In large towns over the last few years , the number of square metres per head has decreased for the first time .
In order to solve the problem , the " Social Housing " alliance suggests a fresh start .
New incentives should revi@@ ve social housing .
For example land transfer tax could be wa@@ ived and the land tax for sponsored housing temporarily suspended .
In addition , according to the association , attractive tax d@@ e@@ preciation possibilities are necessary .
The K@@ f@@ W state bank 's refugee funding programme has already been well received in towns and local authorities .
On Monday evening , a good week after start of the programme , € 18@@ 4 million - more than half of the around € 300 million which had been made available - had already been requested .
The project may now even be stepped up .
Refugees have safe conduct : Croatia and Slo@@ ven@@ ia put corridor in place
Since Hung@@ ary has virtually stopped letting them through , the choice of more and more refugees is the route over Croatia .
Z@@ agre@@ b has announced that they will allow passage over Slo@@ ven@@ ia towards the north without obstacles .
However the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to come to an agreement with n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ bouring Slo@@ ven@@ ia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
" I have spoken to the Slo@@ ven@@ ian Minister for the Interior , and if necessary we will organ@@ ise a corridor , " said Croatian Minister for the Interior R@@ a@@ n@@ k@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slo@@ ven@@ ia lies between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the S@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ gen zone .
EU member Croatia is not yet a S@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ gen country .
After the sealing off of the Serbian Hung@@ arian border , hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to reach West Europe from there .
Five hundred people came over the border at T@@ o@@ var@@ nik , reports Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hung@@ ary had cordoned off its borders for refugees the previous day .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , new laws which came into force on the same day make fair asyl@@ um proceedings in Hung@@ ary practi@@ cally red@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ ant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass through .
The Croatian Prime Minister Z@@ o@@ r@@ an Mil@@ anovic explains , " They may pass through and we are preparing ourselves for this possibility . "
These people are there , they are women children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
They are however people who do not want to live in Croatia .
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the Serbian border to EU n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ our Croatia in the morning .
According to media reports most come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
They arrived at the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and in tax@@ is .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after their arrival they tried to reach the green border to Croatia on foot .
At the Cro@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ an-@@ Serbian border the refugees did not come across border fen@@ ces .
The border strips hold other dangers : there are still active mines there from the Yu@@ g@@ o@@ sla@@ vian civil war in the 90s .
It is now planned for m@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ w@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ers to quickly create a safe passage .
Meanwhile after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hung@@ ary .
On Tuesday police counted 366 people that they had picked up .
Shor@@ tly before the closing of the gate on Monday the number was 9,@@ 380 .
The new Hung@@ arian laws classi@@ fy climbing and damaging the border fen@@ ces as criminal offen@@ ces .
This has led to 35 criminal proceedings being initi@@ ated in the South Hung@@ arian border town of S@@ z@@ e@@ g@@ ed .
Those convicted are threatened with sentences of up to five years and extra@@ dition from the country .
According to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asyl@@ um applications was accepted in the new " transition zone " set up at the border , almost all - 93 - at the biggest crossing at R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people .
On Wednesday morning another 40 refugees were stopped there .
In practice , however , nobody else has a chance of being granted asyl@@ um in Hung@@ ary .
According to opinion in Hung@@ ary , Serbia is " a safe third country . "
The rejected asyl@@ um see@@ kers will be depor@@ ted there .
Only a few hundred refugees now are gathering by " the transition zone " in R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
Workers have begun to clean up in R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke .
They are colle@@ cting the rub@@ bish that tens of thousands of people have left lying at the sides of the roads over the last weeks .
C@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ d barriers are being disman@@ tled and one of the reception cent@@ res in the border town is being r@@ e@@ built .
No one wants to talk about the goal of this rebuilding .
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hung@@ ary , Austria is getting only a few refugees .
Fur@@ ther@@ more the country has strengthened its border controls .
According to the g@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ment , around 20,000 mig@@ rants are still in the country .
In Sal@@ z@@ b@@ u@@ r@@ g , some 1@@ ,@@ 400 people are waiting to travel on to Germany .
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities .
In Fre@@ i@@ l@@ assing one regularly meets small groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor drives " stranded people " over the border
" We were busy cleaning up after the Bridge Festival on Sunday , when suddenly there were ten people standing at the entrance to the tent with s@@ u@@ i@@ t@@ cases , " says Mayor of W@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ stein A@@ l@@ o@@ is Stadler .
Tour@@ ists who wanted to get to Pas@@ s@@ a@@ u by train .
Because Germany had unexpectedly stopped train services to Austria on Sunday due to the influ@@ x of refugees , their journey had come to a halt in W@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ stein , " says Stadler , who immediately offered his help and together with two other helpers and their cars c@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ u@@ red the stranded people over the border to Pas@@ s@@ a@@ u .
Before that we enter@@ tain@@ ed our surprise guests with snacks and drinks .
We said at once that we would take them to Pas@@ s@@ a@@ u by car .
" It was a matter of course for us , " says Stadler , talking to O@@ Ö@@ N .
They were very grateful .
One man insisted on handing over a gener@@ ous don@@ ation - € 100 for the fire bri@@ ga@@ de .
" We were very pleased about that , " says Stadler .
The stranded train passengers had changed trains in Wel@@ s on Sunday evening from an ICE train to a regional train to Pas@@ s@@ a@@ u after the surprise announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended , in an attempt to cross the border anyway .
But the regional train was stopped before the border in W@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ stein am I@@ n@@ n .
In W@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ stein , excur@@ sions over the border are generally very popular .
The Bridge Festival is a joint effort between W@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ stein and Bav@@ arians from Neu@@ kir@@ chen ; the Bridge Festival Association organis@@ es the social event on Sunday and an athle@@ tic two bridge walk the day before with their Bav@@ arian neighbours .
The fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ á@@ n is sending us tens of thousands more is a logical result of his hy@@ p@@ o@@ critical policies :
Instead of providing immediate help to the R@@ ö@@ s@@ z@@ ke camp by construc@@ ting structures which ensure a level of hum@@ a@@ n@@ ity , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hung@@ arian government 's stance closer to an atmosphere of national soci@@ alism .
It is not only those A@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted with c@@ h@@ a@@ o@@ tic conditions in the border areas who are victims of the policy .
Those who have fled , too , must notice that the " promised land " which had invited and welcomed them is not considered another refugee camp .
It will be a huge challenge , in the light of the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter , to create humane conditions for asyl@@ um see@@ kers .
There is a still greater one - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d is looking for w@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ -@@ proof accommod@@ ation for 35@@ ,000
K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d has his hands full with the hosting of refugees .
Christian K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d is used to the fact that his word carries weight .
The government has engaged the former powerful Rai@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ i@@ s@@ en banker to establish accommod@@ ation for thousands of refugees .
K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d has already got to gri@@ ps with the c@@ h@@ a@@ os in the Tra@@ i@@ s@@ kir@@ chen reception centre .
" We no longer have any homeless people in Tra@@ i@@ s@@ kir@@ chen , " he reported on his first achievement .
And the accommod@@ ation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday happened without any great f@@ uss , said K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d , pra@@ ising the organis@@ ational " m@@ a@@ ster@@ piece . "
The Minister of the Interior , however , talked of a " critical situation . "
In total , K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d estimates that accommod@@ ation for 85@@ ,000 will be required in the current year .
In order to meet this figure , accommod@@ ation for another 35@@ ,000 must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 to be provided for by the states and 15,000 by the federal government .
If there are more refugees , we can manage .
" But it is not a bott@@ o@@ m@@ less pit , " says K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d .
He has already carried out talks with the State Govern@@ ors .
They have assured him that accommod@@ ation will also be found for the next refugees to arrive .
" It is going well in Austria , " says Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
The former VP mand@@ a@@ t@@ ary is assi@@ sting K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d .
Tom@@ orrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ p@@ h S@@ c@@ h@@ ö@@ n@@ born , in which it will be confirmed how the Church will help .
The asyl@@ um coordin@@ ator has also got high expectations of the OR@@ F " Help the way we are " campaign .
Private individuals can offer simple accommod@@ ation over this platform .
It is also hoped that this will include hotels , which are often emp@@ ty in winter .
K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d and Ma@@ ier yesterday crit@@ i@@ s@@ ised the spec@@ ific@@ ations for accommod@@ ation as " too high . "
In times of need it should not be necessary for those providing accommod@@ ation to have to comply with certain heights for towel r@@ a@@ ils or sizes of sky@@ lights .
" Emergency standards " should apply for a limited period .
K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d uses his experience as just@@ ification for why he , in contrast to the Ministry for the Interior , should be successful with the accommod@@ ation .
I am an older man , and nobody readily tells u@@ n@@ tru@@ ths to my face
His most important weapon is the power of persu@@ asion .
K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d and Ma@@ ier are not costing the Republic anything , as they themselves explain .
The want to raise the number of their staff from three to four .
Their own search for accommod@@ ation has not yet been successful .
K@@ o@@ n@@ r@@ a@@ d wanted to set up a c@@ o@@ n@@ tain@@ er on Steph@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ p@@ lat@@ z as an office .
But apparently there are problems with o@@ b@@ taining approval .
Lin@@ z demanding a better allocation
For the time being the city of Lin@@ z is not planning to open new sports halls and other buildings such as the Ti@@ ps Arena or the Design Centre as accommod@@ ation for refugees .
At the moment this should not be necess@@ s@@ ary , as the people in question can currently be accom@@ m@@ o@@ dated without these measures , says Mayor Kl@@ aus Lu@@ ger ( S@@ P ) .
But in case of emergency further locations need to be checked for their s@@ u@@ i@@ t@@ ability .
The town chief is critic@@ ising the allocation of refugees within the federal states .
Other districts should also make their own contributions .
Se@@ e@@ h@@ o@@ f@@ er : " Bor@@ ders will not be cordoned off "
In a long telephone call with Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Hor@@ st Se@@ e@@ h@@ o@@ f@@ er ( CSU ) , State Governor Josef P@@ ü@@ h@@ r@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday agreed to further action on the issue of refugees .
Se@@ e@@ h@@ o@@ f@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be cordoned off .
The o@@ n@@ ward journey of refugees into the Federal Republic continues to be possible .
However appropriate border controls do now exist .
There will now no longer be any special trains with refugees trav@@ elling to Germany .
Those seeking protection will however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
P@@ ü@@ h@@ r@@ inger once more called for increased soli@@ d@@ a@@ r@@ ity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states .
The fact that Austria is also now r@@ e@@ intro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing controls at its borders is for P@@ ü@@ h@@ r@@ inger " a logical c@@ o@@ n@@ sequ@@ ence " of Germany 's approach .
The next Run@@ tastic is only a matter of time
The general renovation of the " Neu@@ en Wer@@ ft " in the Lin@@ tz industrial area is officially finished .
The publicly listed IT group S & T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and manufacturing building . It is planned that the rest ( 27@@ 00 m ² ) will be rented to young , innovative businesses in the technology sector .
" In IT clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to get them to work for us , " says S & T boss Hann@@ es N@@ i@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ er .
He can imagine investing in start-@@ up businesses in Neu@@ en Wer@@ ft , and also later acqu@@ iring these .
S & T wants to collaborate with the new neighbours from the start - and N@@ i@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ er promises : " The next Run@@ tastic is only a matter of time . "
S@@ MT is investing € 1.7 million in the location and € 3.@@ 3 million is coming from Tech@@ centre , a third of which belongs to each of the town of Lin@@ tz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( F@@ FG ) .
The building is leased by Lin@@ z AG to S & T and Tech@@ centre for 60 years .
Thir@@ ty percent of the remaining 27@@ 00 m ² in the building is already rented out and there have been e@@ n@@ q@@ u@@ iries about the other 40 percent .
Ow@@ ner of L@@ ia Per@@ oni opens second business in the arcade .
In the new shop the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ u@@ t@@ ta Bre@@ it actually wanted to get a dog .
The 49@@ -year-old p@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ or of L@@ ia Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ k@@ t arcade had to uncerem@@ oni@@ ously post@@ p@@ one this plan : now she has finally expanded by taking on new premises
In the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business where she sells among other things bags , cases , shoes and gar@@ ments from different manufacturers , everything now revol@@ ves around Fur@@ la women 's hand@@ bags ; purses can be obtained starting at € 75 .
Lar@@ ger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
The new shop opened yesterday .
It has been converted over the last few weeks .
" I have been considering for a long time whether I should open another shop , " says Bre@@ it .
Cru@@ cial for this decision was among other things that the Fur@@ la manufacturers , who are based in B@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ a , were impressed with the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
" We are the only people in the greater Lin@@ tz area who sell this brand , " said the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots .
Bre@@ it got her interest in fashion from her mother , when she was still in the cra@@ dle .
It suits me best if something emerges and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
The expert can with absolute certainty give me the answer to the question of why so many women go into rap@@ tures at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag .
Perhaps it 's because a beautiful hand@@ bag can enhance any outfit .
The bra@@ gg@@ art from K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t
The Pal@@ a@@ t@@ ine anc@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants are known as bra@@ g@@ gar@@ ts .
This character@@ istic also conne@@ cts many with the billionaire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always the source of controversy .
Whether he is expres@@ sing x@@ e@@ n@@ o@@ p@@ hob@@ ic opinions , being rude to journalists or revealing gaps in knowledge on crisis politics , the US presidential candidate creates a stir in the election campaign .
And comes out of it well .
This is also something that happens in the Pal@@ a@@ t@@ ine town of K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t , from where the property billionaire 's grandparents origin@@ ate .
The New Yor@@ ker with the b@@ low-@@ dry hair@@ style is a concept to many in the win@@ e@@ m@@ aking village on the wine route .
Many in the village of 1,200 i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants are related to him .
His grandfather came from K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t in the Pal@@ a@@ t@@ ine : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
Sim@@ one Wen@@ del , a resident of K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t , has made a film about Tr@@ ump .
And what do the i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants of the village think about his ambition to become the most powerful man in the world ?
" I think they find it rather exciting , but also in the way of K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t people they are not deeply impressed .
The native of K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t has made an a@@ m@@ using documentary film about the place and its famous o@@ f@@ f@@ shoo@@ ts , included in whom besides Tr@@ ump are also the Hein@@ z ket@@ c@@ h@@ up family .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for his m@@ o@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ y , also gets a chance to speak in " Kings of K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t " ( 2014 ) - with a statement that he would have been successful anyway , even had he lived in K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t .
He has not won over the people there .
There is indeed a certain respect for his family 's achievements , but there also tends to be a view that Tr@@ ump " is a bit of a big@@ mouth , " says Wen@@ del .
C@@ o@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ dent@@ ally , K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t 's nickname in the region is , " Die Br@@ u@@ l@@ l@@ j@@ e@@ s@@ mach@@ er , " a d@@ i@@ a@@ l@@ ect term which trans@@ l@@ ates as " The Bra@@ gg@@ art , " she says .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the bra@@ g@@ gar@@ ts .
The story of the Tr@@ umps ' success began in 18@@ 85 when the man who would become Donald Tr@@ ump 's grandfather emigrated and opened a sal@@ oon for gold prospec@@ tors in the USA .
The foundation stone for his property business was his first purchase of land in New York .
But his grandparents ' lives were not free of tragedy : their wish to return perman@@ ently to their home country collapsed in the Bav@@ arian state to which the Pal@@ a@@ t@@ ine then belon@@ ged .
They would not let Tr@@ ump enter as he had originally left without author@@ isation , the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ a@@ t@@ inate History and Cultural A@@ n@@ thro@@ polo@@ gy , Roland Paul , explains at the beginning of the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grandson of " illegal e@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ rants . "
This is at odds with the sometimes pi@@ thy statements of his desc@@ end@@ ant .
He has repeatedly spoken in d@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ g@@ atory terms about Mex@@ ican immigrants in the US , and demanded the building of a border wall in order to d@@ e@@ ter illegal immigrants .
" The f@@ uss he makes about it is not very nice , " says Han@@ s-@@ Jo@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ im Ben@@ der , a distant rel@@ ative of Tr@@ ump ( " My g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mother was born a Tr@@ ump , my grandfather was born a Hein@@ z " ) .
The retired win@@ emaker sees the American as rather alo@@ of , " he always has a short fuse . "
Does he think Tr@@ ump will come ?
" I can 't imagine it , " says the 7@@ 2-year-old .
" He has never had any interest in K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t . "
Gu@@ est house land@@ lad@@ y V@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ i@@ k@@ a S@@ c@@ h@@ r@@ a@@ mm , like many of K@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t 's i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants , mentions that desc@@ end@@ ants of the Hein@@ z family made a don@@ ation towards the church organ when they visited , which was very well received .
" I can 't imagine Donald doing that , " says the 68@@ -year-old .
She would prefer it if he doesn 't win the election as " he has such radical opinions , I don 't know whether it would be a good thing . "
If anyone like him had been in charge in his grandfather 's time , " he would never have gone there . "
" There are more interesting top@@ ics than him , " says win@@ emaker 's daughter Sarah B@@ ü@@ h@@ ler .
And as president ?
" He 's certainly not my president , " she says .
And , " the grap@@ es will r@@ i@@ pen without President Tr@@ ump . "
Wen@@ del 's film , for which Tr@@ ump gave a lengthy interview , has been seen by 12,000 cin@@ e@@ m@@ a-@@ goers , and interest is also growing in the USA .
The Upper Bav@@ arian district of Ram@@ s@@ a@@ u b@@ e@@ i B@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ h@@ t@@ e@@ s@@ ga@@ den is Germany 's first " Moun@@ tain@@ eers ' Village . "
The village of 1@@ ,@@ 800 i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants in the B@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ h@@ t@@ e@@ s@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for " Gent@@ le Tourism " from the hand of the Vice President of the German Alp@@ ine Association , L@@ u@@ d@@ w@@ i@@ g W@@ u@@ cher@@ p@@ fen@@ ning , on Wednesday .
There are already 20 " Moun@@ tain@@ eers ' Vill@@ ages " in Austria .
In our n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ bouring country , the local Alp@@ ine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the distinction .
A " Moun@@ tain@@ eers ' Village " is permitted to have a maximum of 2,500 residents .
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
Seven 's Sunrise domin@@ ates ratings , despite Nine 's attempts to cover the leadership s@@ p@@ ill on Today Show
Karl Ste@@ fan@@ ovic and Lisa Wilkinson 's d@@ ash to Can@@ berra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal leadership s@@ p@@ ill has failed to generate much of a ratings boost for Today .
Nine 's breakfast show screened from the national capital after Malcolm Turn@@ bull 's over@@ throw of Tony Abbott .
Ri@@ val Sunrise , hosted by David Koch and Samantha A@@ r@@ my@@ tage , was stuck in London as part of a week@@ -long series of international t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ asts which also include Dubai , New York , Ni@@ a@@ g@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
That ty@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ny of distance didn 't seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers with Sunrise aver@@ aging 39@@ 7,000 viewers across the five capital cities to Today 's 339,000 .
Today scored a slight up@@ tick compared to its ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) but its figure was behind last Thursday 's ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise in recent months .
In August , Today aver@@ aged 318@@ ,000 to Sunrise 's 33@@ 0,000 .
At the start of the year the gap was running at between 40,000 and 50,000 .
So far in September , Sunrise is aver@@ aging 3@@ 49@@ ,000 viewers to Today 's 3@@ 14@@ ,000 .
This is the most interesting thing that 's happened all morning .

The final three agree B@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ l@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose ?
Secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ n@@ s-@@ Fellows , Sarah M@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ay and Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ski may have unwit@@ tingly revealed who wins The B@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ l@@ or .
The woman who Sam Wood ends up with on The B@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ l@@ or has been sw@@ athed in utmost secrecy .
And the three girls left standing certainly aren 't letting slip whether they are the one who received his final rose .
But when we checked in with Sarah M@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ay , Sne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ o@@ ski and L@@ ana Je@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ n@@ s-@@ Fellows the day before three become two , they may have inadvert@@ ently given away a clu@@ e as to who the winner will be .
Sam Wood is keeping his l@@ i@@ ps firmly sealed until Thursday 's finale
All three women wa@@ xed lyrical over why Wood is the perfect man , citing his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positi@@ vity as reasons they would each love to be his partner .
However when asked the question , " If not you , who should get Wood 's final rose ? , " their answers could have provided a spo@@ i@@ l@@ er as to who won the B@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ l@@ ors heart .
Both Je@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ n@@ s-@@ Fellows and Mark@@ o@@ ski were quick to name M@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ay as , apart from themselves , the best match for Wood .
Sarah M@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ay and Sam Wood have shared an easy rap@@ port since day one .
" From the moment I walked into the house , reading ( Sarah 's ) energy and Sam 's energy I felt like they were quite compatible and I kept thinking that throughout the course of the show , " said Je@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ n@@ s-@@ Fellows .
" Sarah is really down to earth , she 's so much fun to be around , " added Mark@@ o@@ ski .
I 've seen them together and they do have that chem@@ istry there .
They do feel nice and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
For her part , M@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ay said last week 's home visit dates made her real@@ ise Wood could be " the one . "
" Once I saw him with my friends and family I real@@ ised this obviously isn 't just a game - I 'm w@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ h@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ tedly invested in him now , " she said .
And asked who Wood should choose if not her , she was e@@ n@@ i@@ g@@ matic .
" I don 't know if I can say , " she said .

J@@ arr@@ y@@ d H@@ a@@ y@@ ne had several options of where to begin his NFL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed plenty of interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams making inqu@@ iries after his impressive open training day late last year .
But H@@ a@@ y@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it 's looking like a wise decision .
Some coaches would have ben@@ ched H@@ a@@ y@@ ne for the rest of the game for losing a fumble like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first pun@@ t return in Tuesday 's 20-@@ 3 win against Minnesota .
But Tom@@ sul@@ a showed faith in his man , giving H@@ a@@ y@@ ne the next opportunity to return a pun@@ t and including him in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true colo@@ urs in the locker room after the game .
Instead of che@@ wing out his r@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also backed H@@ a@@ y@@ ne publicly in his post-@@ match press conference .
49@@ ers beat reporter Cam Inman reported that H@@ a@@ y@@ ne also received encouragement from special teams co-@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas McG@@ a@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ e@@ y , who advised him to forget about his dropped catch and worry about the next play .
J@@ arr@@ y@@ d H@@ a@@ y@@ ne f@@ u@@ m@@ bles a pun@@ t that was recovered by the Minnesota Vik@@ ings during the first quarter
It was certainly not the start H@@ a@@ y@@ ne and his massive Australian following had been hoping for in his NFL debut .
H@@ a@@ y@@ ne was seen c@@ u@@ r@@ sing as he made his way from the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish & Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.@@ 1 he couldn 't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career .
" It was just one of those things , you just worry about the next play and that 's it , " said H@@ a@@ y@@ ne .
H@@ a@@ y@@ ne likened the b@@ l@@ under to his Ori@@ gin debut back in 2007 when a pass in his own in-@@ goal led to a Q@@ u@@ e@@ ens@@ land try .
Overall it was still an amazing experience for the 27@@ -year-old .

Because of the large number of refugees , the Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler are calling for 1000 new teachers in Bav@@ aria .
At the start of the F@@ W autum@@ n conc@@ lave , party and faction leader Hubert A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger issued a warning about a severe crisis in Bav@@ aria 's schools if there are not sufficient new teachers for the many new school@@ children : " We need at least 1000 additional teachers to stop the schools from collapsing , " said A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger .
" Otherwise we will have up@@ heav@@ als in the Bav@@ arian education system . "
The Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler faction is in session in the Lower F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ ian community until Friday .
Very different main top@@ ics were originally planned .
But the record number of refugees is domin@@ ating the Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler meeting too .
" Of course the subject of asyl@@ um is the main issue at the conc@@ lave , " says A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger .
A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger is demanding the establishment of a UN safety zone in Syria , similar to the one during the Yu@@ g@@ o@@ sla@@ vian war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
" It can 't go on like this , we have to get to the causes , " says the Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler head .
The Fre@@ ie W@@ ä@@ h@@ ler want to d@@ e@@ port failed asyl@@ um see@@ kers as quickly as possible .
For this reason , A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger also wants more personnel for the a@@ d@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ative courts , which are responsible for asyl@@ um cases : " We need at least 50 new asyl@@ um judges as well , " says A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger .
The F@@ W head criticised the lack of consistency between several federal states : " We need uni@@ fied standards in the Federal states nationwide . "
" Bav@@ aria d@@ e@@ ports ; others don 't . "
" We must be more efficient . "
However , regional politics in Gro@@ s@@ sw@@ a@@ h@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t should not be allowed to suffer .
An issue that has been running for many years remains on the agenda : educational policy .
In the new school year the Education Minister , L@@ u@@ d@@ w@@ i@@ g S@@ p@@ a@@ e@@ n@@ le ( CD@@ U ) , started a " middle school plus " pilot project , in which an extension of the middle level in g@@ r@@ a@@ mm@@ ars schools from three to four years is being tested - this will result in a return to taking nine years up to the university entry quali@@ fication exam .
But that is not enough for A@@ i@@ wan@@ ger .
" The G9 issue must be spe@@ eded up , " says the F@@ W head .
We demand freedom of choice for all g@@ r@@ a@@ mm@@ ar schools that want it .
A free move to G9 everywhere it is wanted .
S@@ t@@ ron@@ ger Wall Street gives Da@@ x a helping hand
After an over-@@ long stretch of aim@@ less and e@@ d@@ gy trading , the German stock market has closed with gains .
It was only in the afternoon that a stronger rally on the US stock market provided a cle@@ arer direction which ultimately lifted the Da@@ x by 0.56 percent to 10,@@ 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
The value of M@@ Da@@ x medium size companies gained 0@@ .@@ 54 percent to 19,@@ 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
The techn@@ olog@@ y-@@ heavy Tec@@ Da@@ x rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 1,7@@ 36.@@ 69 points .
The Euro@@ Stoxx 50 , the benchmark index in the Euro@@ zone , moved ahead by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ ,@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
The markets in London and Paris also registered solid gains .
In the USA the Dow Jones index closed at about 1 percent up .
Many brokers reck@@ on that markets will remain s@@ t@@ atic until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also the major matur@@ ity of the futures exchanges this Friday .
Disc@@ ussion about the impact due to the p@@ h@@ asing out of nuclear energy has meanwhile pushed R@@ W@@ E stocks to an all time low and also left a significant mark on E@@ on .
According to the " Spiegel , " the German energy companies potentially lack € 30 billion in reserves .
The German Federal Government denied the figures quoted in the press .
Stocks in the two largest German energy businesses have sub@@ sequ@@ ently recovered somewhat , although ultimately R@@ W@@ E lost 3.@@ 31 percent and E@@ on 6.@@ 15 percent .
Infin@@ e@@ on shares climbed to the top of the Da@@ x by a further 3.@@ 22 percent .
In the view of one trader , a positive report by US investment magazine " Bar@@ ron 's " at the weekend continues to have an effect .

4 Killed After Police Fire Rub@@ ber Bul@@ lets at Protest@@ ers in Nep@@ al
Four people , including a 4@@ -year-old boy , were killed in southern Nep@@ al after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demon@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ating against the country 's proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ hi , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u , the capital .
Bish@@ n@@ u Pras@@ ad Dha@@ k@@ al , the chief district officer , said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station , some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr. Dha@@ k@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before r@@ e@@ s@@ orting to rubber bullets .
Tw@@ enty police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets , which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less@@ -@@ lethal alternative , apparently produced such a high death toll .
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nep@@ al 's southern plain@@ s , where members of the Mad@@ hes@@ i ethnic group say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution would d@@ i@@ l@@ u@@ te their political influence .
There have also been protests in western Nep@@ al from ethnic T@@ h@@ arus who want their own state .
At least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been killed in violent clashes since A@@ u@@ g .
10 , when four major political parties signed an agreement to divi@@ de the country into provinces - a major step toward a new constitution but a highly conten@@ tious issue in Nep@@ al , which has been cent@@ rally g@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ ed for centuries .
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but lawmakers a@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ r@@ ated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
Lawmakers have been voting on cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u this week , and officials have said that the new charter could be e@@ n@@ acted by Sunday .
C@@ o@@ n@@ tru@@ ction area planned in the town
The plot of land at the A@@ l@@ te Post youth centre in Em@@ den is going to be built on again .
The town is currently making preparations to market the 4@@ 000 square met@@ re area .
A mixture of trade , commer@@ ce and housing is planned - although there are no firm offers so far .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to sell a plot of land of around 4@@ 000 square metres directly adjacent to the A@@ l@@ te Post youth centre .
P@@ r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ ations are currently underway .
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade , commer@@ ce and housing .
A spokesperson for the town states that it is awaiting suitable offers .
The identities of possible investors are not yet clear .
C@@ o@@ n@@ sequ@@ ently , no contract has yet been concluded .
The town of Em@@ den sold a part of the site , situ@@ ated on the R@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ asse / corner of Gro@@ s@@ se S@@ t@@ ras@@ se a few months ago and the building which previously stood there was demolished .
H@@ i@@ e@@ ve project : facts are in the open
Plans for the holiday home development at the Kl@@ e@@ i@@ n@@ es M@@ e@@ er near Em@@ den are taking shape .
Investors have presented their plans for the project to the public .
A number of residents are again concerned - they are worried about the sale of their leisure refu@@ ge .
Plans have been negotiated , mul@@ led over , debated , and plotted behind closed doors for months .
Now the plans for a new holiday home development on the Kl@@ e@@ i@@ n@@ es M@@ e@@ er near Em@@ den are in the open .
The interested party , the Em@@ den company " Sy@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ m@@ -@@ B@@ au , " presented their plans to the Em@@ den Council development committee for the first time on Monday evening .
Origin@@ ally this point was scheduled as a part of the agenda not open to the public .
Under pressure from critics of the project and from the FD@@ P faction , who had accused investors and the administration of secre@@ tiveness , Ral@@ f Behr@@ ends of the Sy@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ m@@ -@@ B@@ au management went on the offensive . " We don 't yet have an answer for all the questions , " he said in front of the council members and more than 50 spectators .
But it is good to be able to counter all the rumours now .
The € 10 - 12 million project has been under discussion for months .
Pictures and new details of the proposed hotel building provoked strong reactions among owners of properties at the lake who attended the meeting ,
Roberto S@@ c@@ h@@ u@@ l@@ z , property owner and member of the board of the residents ' lobby group , Pro H@@ i@@ e@@ ve , claims : " It 's going to be a huge development which looms over all the other buildings . "
Fur@@ ther@@ more , like a number of other critics of the project , he is afraid that traffic will increase enorm@@ ously due to the proposed size of the facility . " We have to reck@@ on with whole bus@@ loads arriving , " said S@@ c@@ h@@ u@@ l@@ z .
However it is not yet clear what exactly is going to happen on the hec@@ t@@ are sized area of the former restaurant .
No operator has yet been identified .
" First of all we have to present a c@@ o@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ ent concept , " says Ral@@ f Behr@@ ends .
Since this does not yet exist , construction plans are still subject to vari@@ ation .

Google laun@@ ches don@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ -@@ matching campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( G@@ O@@ O@@ G@@ L.@@ O ) announced a don@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ -@@ matching campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations ai@@ ding the thousands of refugees that have overwhelmed European nations as they fle@@ e war-torn and impoverished countries .
Google took an u@@ n@@ character@@ istically personal approach in announcing the don@@ ation drive on its blog .
Rather than having an executive make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experience .
" Our journey involved many dark train and bus rides , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , " she wrote .
I was lucky .
But as the refugee and mig@@ rant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desperate for help .
The donations will go toward four nonprofit organizations that are providing aid to refugees and mig@@ rants : Doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Rescue Committee , Sa@@ ve the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees .
Google said it will match the first $ 5.@@ 5 million worth of donations glob@@ ally at goo@@ gle@@ .com / refu@@ g@@ e@@ e@@ r@@ e@@ l@@ ief until it raises $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely driven by the four@@ -year-old civil war in Syria , which has displaced more than 4 million people this year .
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

For mildly obese diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years , according to a new study .
It 's still to early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-@@ surgical treatments , however .
" The mor@@ tal@@ ity data take a long time to show up , " said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
W@@ e@@ i@@ ght loss operations , or bar@@ iatric surgery , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
They reduce hunger and limit the body 's ability to absor@@ b food .
Over the years , bar@@ iatric s@@ u@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ r@@ ies have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies were done in people who are mor@@ b@@ i@@ d@@ ly obese , with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or above .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in rel@@ ation to height , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
A BM@@ I of 25 or higher indic@@ ates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obese .
You can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ usa@@ .gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
For the new study , researchers from Taiwan 's M@@ i@@ n@@ -@@ Sh@@ e@@ n@@ g General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a trial comparing two kinds of bar@@ iatric surgery - g@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ ric bypass and sleeve g@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ tom@@ y - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese .
The average BM@@ I among those who had surgery fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of their fifth year in the study .
Meanwhile , the BM@@ I among those receiving non-@@ surgical diabetes treatments stayed about the same at 29 .
Among those who had surgery , diabetes resolved completely in 36 percent and parti@@ ally in 28 percent .
In the medi@@ call@@ y-@@ treated group , by comparison , diabetes resolved completely in only 1 percent and parti@@ ally in only about 2 percent .
In addition , control of blood pressure , t@@ r@@ i@@ glyc@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ des , and " bad " LD@@ L cholesterol " was generally better in the surgical group , " the authors found .
The researchers also monitored patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflect blood sugar levels over time .
H@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
After surgery , the average hemoglobin A@@ 1@@ c level fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
In the medical therapy group , however , it remained steady at about 8 percent .
But this better " glyc@@ emic control " - as reflected by the improved hemoglobin A@@ 1@@ c levels - did not reduce the mor@@ tal@@ ity rate at five years , according to lead researcher Dr. C@@ h@@ i@@ h@@ -@@ C@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ g Hsu and colleagues .
The research team also compared average outcomes with the two types of surgery .
At the fifth year , compared to the sleeve g@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ tom@@ y group , the bypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger drops in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs 5.@@ 1 ) and in hemoglobin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 percent vs 2.1 percent ) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 percent vs 16@@ .@@ 7 percent ) .
While the new study does not show a survival benefit or surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of h@@ e@@ a@@ vier people in Sweden that surgery does lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone , of the University of Arizona College of M@@ e@@ dic@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ -@@ Phoenix .
In the Swedish study , obese people who had bar@@ iatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years , compared to a group who tried more conven@@ tional methods .
Though the new study didn 't show a benefit in survival among surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it 's reass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 interested in the procedure .
" This is where this paper is critical , because it says this surgery is safe in that lower BM@@ I group , " with no increased risk of death or r@@ e@@ n@@ al disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient 's BM@@ I falls between 27 and 30 .
" I think we wait too long to get people to be serious about this , " she said .
I think that once they 've accumulated these genetic changes that hard@@ w@@ i@@ red their bodies into obesity and diabetes , rever@@ sing that is really hard .

" It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe " - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not host all refugees , the Dalai Lama has said , adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East .
The Ti@@ b@@ e@@ t@@ an Buddhist leader has called for the ending violence in the refugees " home countries .
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for C@@ o@@ m@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to eth@@ ics studies , at the beginning of his 10-@@ day visit to the UK .
He claimed that , under current circumstances , the interests of hum@@ a@@ n@@ ity should be put before the interests of single nations or even cont@@ i@@ n@@ ents .
He also stressed that , however admi@@ r@@ a@@ ble , the West-@@ European countries " response to the refugee crisis is i@@ n@@ adequate to the situation .
" It it 's impossible for everyone to come to Europe , " he said in his speech .
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany 's and Austria 's efforts in dealing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
" So taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the mean time you have to think about long-term solutions , how to bring genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , " he emp@@ h@@ a@@ sized .
Ultimately we have to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries .
We have to reduce the use of force .
The use of force has never solved these problems , " he added .
Ad@@ dressing the issue of violence , the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush 's actions following 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , claiming that the US " violent response engen@@ dered a chain of u@@ n@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
After 9 / 11 I expressed my condol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and told him the way to solve this problem was through non-@@ violence .
I know his m@@ o@@ tives were good but he used force and it created unexpected consequences , " the Dalai Lama said .
Four@@ fold increase in children i@@ n@@ gest@@ ing hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer in last 4 years
P@@ o@@ ison control centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-@@ percent up@@ tick since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 s@@ wal@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing high@@ ly-@@ alcoho@@ lic hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer , according to the Georgia P@@ o@@ ison Center .
According to Dr. G@@ a@@ y@@ lord Lopez , director of the Georgia P@@ o@@ ison Center , hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer i@@ n@@ gest@@ ion cases in children under 12 that were reported to poison control centers went up from 3@@ ,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
" Kids are getting into these products more frequently , and unfortunately , there 's a percentage of them going to the emergency room , " Lopez told CNN .
He said some kids are drinking san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer intentionally , while some do it to impres@@ s their friends or on a soci@@ al-@@ media d@@ are .
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer for a cheap buzz .
Te@@ ens have reportedly mixed san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer with alcohol@@ -@@ containing mou@@ t@@ h@@ wash for a sti@@ ffer drink .
Yo@@ unger children can be drawn to attractive san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer s@@ c@@ ents .
" A kid is not thinking this is bad for them , " Lopez said .
A lot of the more attractive ( hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zers ) are the ones that are s@@ c@@ ented .
There are stra@@ w@@ berry , g@@ r@@ a@@ pe , o@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ -@@ fla@@ v@@ o@@ red hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zers that are very appealing to kids .
H@@ and san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
In young children , especially , only a few squ@@ i@@ r@@ ts can cause alcohol poisoning .
" It 's highly concentrated alcohol , " Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control center at University of Kansas Hospital , told Fox 4 in Kansas City .
So you wouldn 't leave a shot of whis@@ key sitting around , but people will have these hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zers out and if kids get into it , it 's a quick way to consu@@ me a lot of alcohol .
N@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ j@@ ah Russell , a six@@ -year-old girl who recently i@@ n@@ gest@@ ed as many as four squ@@ i@@ r@@ ts of stra@@ w@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ r@@ y-@@ s@@ c@@ ented hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer at school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
Her blood-@@ alcohol level was .@@ 17@@ 9 , twice the threshold considered leg@@ ally drunk in an adult , according to Dr. Chris Rit@@ c@@ h@@ ey , an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ j@@ ah was sl@@ u@@ r@@ ring her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room .
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children 's hospital for any signs of brain t@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ ma , as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head , Rit@@ c@@ h@@ ey said .
" That was very scary , " Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ j@@ ah 's mother , told CNN .
It could have been very lethal for my child .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers use non@@ alcoho@@ lic products or san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zing w@@ i@@ pes short of moving hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer out of a child 's reach .
Beyond alcohol poisoning , some san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zers have been linked to deaths .
In 20@@ 13 , two On@@ tar@@ io women died after s@@ wal@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer that contained a toxic , u@@ n@@ declared ingredient .
Health officials s@@ u@@ r@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ ed that the product contained m@@ e@@ than@@ ol , a deadly agent , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as the active ingredient .
In January , three fourth-@@ grade students in up@@ state New York plotted to poison their " mean " teacher " by putting anti@@ bac@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ial products around the classroom , " according to a police report .
The teacher is highly aller@@ g@@ i@@ c to hand san@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ zer and banned it from her room .
Police considered the f@@ o@@ iled plan to be " idle c@@ h@@ a@@ t@@ ter , " referring discipline to the school district .

Why I 'm A Wit@@ ness At An Execu@@ tion In Oklahoma
Later today , bar@@ ring a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
If it happens , and I hope it won 't , I will sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Pen@@ i@@ t@@ enti@@ ary as Richard G@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ sip is executed by lethal inj@@ ection .
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death .
The invitation was first made back in January , via his best friend , and though I was shocked , I agreed .
As the day approaches , I 've come to d@@ r@@ e@@ ad it .
So why do it ?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way of telling the full story about the death penalty .
It would offer a unique perspective .
True , journalists are permitted to watch executions in America and because there are often more applications than seats available , a mac@@ a@@ b@@ re lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five .
Whoever is picked will watch it disp@@ assi@@ o@@ n@@ ately .
I cannot do that .
I will be sitting alongside Richard G@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ sip 's closest friends , and I have developed my own relationship with him through months of phone calls , and one visit lasting two-@@ and-a-@@ half hours .
I like the guy .
We often laugh a lot when we talk .
The prison authorities say I cannot be both a witness and a journalist , so I won 't be allowed a notebook and pen to record what I see .
I will just have to try to remember all the details .
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twit@@ ter of c@@ o@@ m@@ promising my imparti@@ ality .
Here 's the lesson .
Tell the i@@ n@@ mate 's story the way he likes it , get access .
I complained to her .
She admitted that she " could have p@@ h@@ r@@ ased it better , " but still thinks I 'm wrong to do what I 'm doing .
Richard G@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ sip has taken issue with some of the things I 've said and written .
He doesn 't tell me what to write , and I wouldn 't do it even if he did .
I 've told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it .
If he dies , he thinks the publicity will help the anti-@@ death penalty movement .
Kim Bell@@ w@@ are , a reporter from the Huff@@ ington Post , will be alongside me .
If you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I 've made .
I won 't go over all the details again here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ sip is innocent .
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being an a@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ory after the fact .
But I believe there is a strong prob@@ ability that he is not guilty of murder .
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
And it 's from this perspective that I will watch him die .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
There will be other reporters you can turn to for that .
What you will get from me is what it 's like to watch a man I like die an u@@ n@@ necessary death .
Man c@@ o@@ axed from C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ ing River after soggy police chase
The C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ ing Vale const@@ able remained dry as he c@@ o@@ axed the man from the C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ ing River .
A Perth man 's bid to lose a police tail came u@@ n@@ d@@ one after he found himself in s@@ h@@ allow , muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to " c@@ o@@ a@@ x him gently back to shore . "
C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ ing Vale police were called to a t@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ assing incident in B@@ e@@ c@@ ken@@ ham on Tuesday .
When they spotted the suspect he tried to d@@ i@@ t@@ ch them by heading into the C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ ing River .
But he didn 't get too far .
" He was standing in the water saying ' I 'm not getting out , ' come and get me ' , " Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ l@@ e@@ d@@ ine said .
Const@@ able Lach@@ lan Per@@ h@@ a@@ ve@@ c wasn 't too keen on getting his uniform wet , so he employed a safer tac@@ tic - " good police negotiation . "
" Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape , " Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ l@@ e@@ d@@ ine said .
Champion foot@@ baller Ben C@@ o@@ u@@ s@@ ins provides a memor@@ able example .
In 2006 , C@@ o@@ u@@ s@@ ins d@@ i@@ t@@ ched his car to avoid a boo@@ ze bus and attempted to swim across the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy alleges ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moo@@ dy has alleged Rac@@ ing Vic@@ tor@@ ia ste@@ wards attempted to plant a spy in his s@@ t@@ a@@ b@@ les last year and threatened to quit racing immediately .
He took aim at ste@@ wards and Rac@@ ing Vic@@ tor@@ ia 's integrity department , alleging they have a personal campaign against him with the late scrat@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment the final straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what is best for racing and has found himself in difficult circumstances when it comes to L@@ i@@ d@@ ari 's positive s@@ wa@@ b to c@@ o@@ b@@ alt , which he can not explain .
He had bit@@ ten his tongue about the spy allegations for 18 months and didn 't want it " to look like sour grap@@ es . "
" I wasn 't going to say anything about that and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you get so fru@@ strated it all comes out at once , " Moo@@ dy said .
They know it went on .
Sometimes you react and have to live the consequences and I will have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with my head held high and want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
When they start to think I 'm not that 's when I shouldn 't be a t@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ er .
I would then have to consider what I do with my lic@@ ence .
Earlier , Moo@@ dy had dropped the b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ shell in a rac@@ ing.com interview that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
" Eigh@@ teen months ago Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I will name if asked - and offered him employment to work in my s@@ t@@ a@@ b@@ les to offer information on what I was doing within my s@@ t@@ a@@ b@@ les , " Moo@@ dy said on Rac@@ ing.com .
They obviously believe I 'm a che@@ at .
If that 's the case s@@ u@@ rely they should all hand in their brief@@ s because they 've been i@@ n@@ competent in trying to catch me .
Robert R@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ s@@ t@@ on , former chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , current chairman of R@@ V@@ L , and Bern@@ ard Sa@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are aware of that today .
Should that make me think it 's becoming personal ?
Has R@@ V@@ L got a grow a set of balls and maybe make people outside of trainers responsible for what it is going on the industry ?
Am I bad for the industry ?
Am I that bad for the industry ?
Maybe people out there think I am .
Maybe they need to take my lic@@ ence off me and push me away and I 've got no doubt what I 'm saying now might make them think about that .
But I 've got to the point now where I don 't care and that s@@ a@@ d@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ s me .
That really s@@ a@@ d@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ s me .
I will put the pressure on them and o@@ n@@ us on them to make a decision .
I 've got the support of my family and I can walk away .
The t@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ er 's frustration levels have built with the long-@@ running c@@ o@@ b@@ alt inquiry involving L@@ i@@ d@@ ari and the late scrat@@ ching had him saying that he could " throw my lic@@ ence across the table . "
Moo@@ dy , best known for preparing unbeaten champion Black C@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ ar , lab@@ elled the race-@@ day treatment rule " ridiculous " after a mud or cl@@ ay p@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ ce had been applied to the horses legs , which is against the rules .
It 's against the rules of racing .
I 've got to accept full responsibility for that , " he said .
One of my staff mistakenly laced mud on its leg .
It could have had it last night .
It could have had it yesterday , which it did have .
It had it on race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three-@@ month dis@@ quali@@ fication for the race day treatment using the p@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ ce , which ste@@ wards have opened an inquiry into .
It is a jo@@ ke .
People making these rules know nothing about the horse .
" We all understand that we need for rules but it has gone too far , " Moo@@ dy said .
Cob@@ ram h@@ i@@ t@@ -and-@@ run driver arrested
Police have arrested a man over a h@@ i@@ t@@ -and-@@ run collision with a cyclist in Cob@@ ram at the weekend .
The cyclist was air@@ lifted to the Royal Mel@@ bourne Hospital with serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning .
Police said the motor@@ ist drove away without stopping to help the injured rider .
On Monday a 50-@@ year-old N@@ ath@@ alia man handed himself in to police at She@@ p@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ ton .
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop at an accident , failing to render assistance , and other traffic offen@@ ces .

Mel@@ bourne Storm coach Craig Bell@@ amy hits back at rivals over wrest@@ ling claims
Mel@@ bourne Storm coach Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of his side 's tackling as " agenda setting " by the N@@ R@@ L 's two prem@@ iership favour@@ ites .
Sydney Roo@@ sters coach Trent Robinson said the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm to " wrest@@ le " his side during the Storm 's upset win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
B@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ ban@@ e Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thin@@ ly ve@@ iled reference to the Storm after his side 's qualifying final win over North Q@@ u@@ e@@ ens@@ land Cowboys on Saturday night when he called that game a " show@@ case " of the rugby league and said the two Q@@ u@@ e@@ ens@@ land weren 't " too big " into wrest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy defended his side 's tackling and said they just focused on their " contact " when tackling .
Bell@@ amy added he took confidence from having two leading coaches critic@@ ise his side as it meant they were concerned about the Storm beating them .
" That keeps coming up - I didn 't hear Trent Robinson bring up wrest@@ ling when they beat us 24-@@ 2 , " Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee we haven 't changed nothing all year with our defensive systems or techniques , it 's just that the last six weeks we have made a real emphasis with our contact in tac@@ kles and that has been the turn around for us .
Trent has been there three years and he obviously has a great side to coach so he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock to him .
It 's funny how this always comes up at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy challenged Bennett 's idea of " exciting football " remin@@ ding his ment@@ or that Bennett 's St Geor@@ ge-@@ Il@@ l@@ a@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ ra Dra@@ g@@ ons won the prem@@ iership in 2010 by playing " bor@@ ing " football .
Wayne is talking about exciting foo@@ ty .
He made a point of comparing his game on Saturday night with our one on Friday night and how exciting their game was , " Bell@@ amy said .
I remember in 2010 St George was criticised a lot for being a bor@@ ing team and Wayne said he didn 't give a rat 's a@@ r@@ se .
But now he has a team which can play what we would see as exciting foo@@ ty , especially his young h@@ a@@ l@@ ves with their speed .
That 's the foo@@ ty you would want to play when you have those sort of players .
He made that point in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his style of foo@@ ty - not every team has two h@@ a@@ l@@ ves like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that .
To me it builds more confidence because they are saying these things because they are a little bit concerned about playing us .
Six weeks ago they probably weren 't thinking of us when they get to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out the Storm and Roo@@ sters game was a higher scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys game .
The Broncos game was probably a good game , I haven 't watched it yet but what was the score ? 16-@@ 12 ?
Our game it was 20-@@ 18 , there was two more tries in our game but is that exciting foo@@ ty ?
Or is it making breaks and not scoring tries that is exciting ?
To me it 's a@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ as .
If they are m@@ e@@ n@@ tion@@ ing us it means that at some stage we might meet them there .
The Storm have this weekend off as they have won the right to host either North Q@@ u@@ e@@ ens@@ land Cowboys or C@@ ron@@ u@@ l@@ la Sharks in next Saturday night 's preliminary final at A@@ AM@@ I Park with tickets on sale from next Tuesday morning .
Serbian man gets $ 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ k bail on drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 k@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ grams of cocaine that was smu@@ gg@@ led into Q@@ u@@ e@@ ens@@ land has been granted bail on a $ 200,000 s@@ u@@ r@@ e@@ ty .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ s@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ vic , 29 , was one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 k@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ grams of the drug from the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and docked at C@@ o@@ o@@ m@@ era in August .
Mak@@ s@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ vic was observed meeting with his co-@@ accused at the mar@@ ina throughout the morning and later met them at the C@@ o@@ o@@ m@@ era R@@ o@@ a@@ d@@ house cafe , where police found 40 k@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
Despite facing a potential life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quant@@ ity of cocaine , Mak@@ s@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ vic 's lawyer argued there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all of it and that he might have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose .
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned Mak@@ s@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ vic was a flight risk .
He has clear conne@@ ctions to Serbia .
He travels to Serbia often , " he told the court on Wednesday .
On the crown case he lied to police about where he was staying .
Mak@@ s@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ vic 's mother and step@@ father had join@@ tly offered a s@@ u@@ r@@ e@@ ty of $ 200,000 to secure his release .
" Having read the affidavits of both those persons , it is clear that the i@@ m@@ position of a s@@ u@@ r@@ e@@ ty of $ 200,000 constit@@ utes a real financial burden on them , " Judge Flanagan said .
But that alone was insufficient to d@@ e@@ ter him from failing to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ s@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ vic was granted bail on the conditions that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports , report to police on a daily basis and a@@ d@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ es to a 6@@ p@@ m-@@ 6@@ am curfew .
Ac@@ c@@ i@@ dent on the A@@ 5 near Kar@@ ls@@ r@@ u@@ he : driver 's c@@ ab torn apart
A lorry driver was seriously injured in a collision between three l@@ o@@ r@@ ries on the A@@ 5 motorway near Kar@@ ls@@ r@@ u@@ he on Tuesday evening .
Two of the three l@@ o@@ r@@ ries involved had bra@@ ked approaching long-term road@@ works in the direction of Bas@@ el .
The third driver noticed too late and tried u@@ n@@ successfully to swer@@ ve left at the last moment , according to police .
The c@@ ab of the driver responsible for the accident was completely torn apart .
The driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries .
The A@@ 5 between Bru@@ c@@ h@@ sal and Kar@@ ls@@ r@@ u@@ he North was completely closed for over six hours until 2 a.m .

Ste@@ van H@@ o@@ gg used girls phone to lure pa@@ e@@ d@@ ophil@@ es to send images
A pa@@ e@@ d@@ ophile used an 11-@@ year-old girl 's phone to solic@@ it child abuse images .
Ste@@ van H@@ o@@ gg took the girl 's phone as she slept then log@@ ged into an online mes@@ s@@ a@@ ging service where he had a succession of inde@@ cent images of children sent to him by another user .
The girl later woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in sleeping H@@ o@@ gg 's hand .
She looked through it and found the disturbing messages before immediately alerting her mother .
Police attended and saw the five pictures , then analy@@ sed computers found at the address and discovered " conc@@ erning " web searches using terms for finding inde@@ cent image of children .
H@@ o@@ gg then claimed to officers he had done it as it would " lead pa@@ e@@ d@@ ophil@@ es " on the internet before " p@@ r@@ e@@ tending he was a police officer to scare them . "
Fiscal dep@@ ute E@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ d@@ h Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court : " He said it was an a@@ d@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to scaring people .
He accepted the searches were made by him on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pa@@ e@@ d@@ ophil@@ es .
He was asked about his convers@@ ations with the unknown person who sent him the images and him asking them to send more photos .
He said he was doing it to lure them in .
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking and said he wants to view rape and murder images .
Ms Robertson added : " When the girl found the messages on the phone she shouted her mother and was shaking and crying .
She saw the inde@@ cent images on the phone and the accused was then confron@@ ted .
The girl was interviewed and spoke of the accused using the computer and Play@@ station to talk to girls who looked way younger than him .
H@@ o@@ gg , 23 , of Ward Road , Dundee , pleaded guilty on indictment to charges of taking or making inde@@ cent images of children on June 14 last year , bre@@ aching bail on January 25 this year and failing to attend at court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
Defence solic@@ itor Greg@@ or Sim asked that H@@ o@@ gg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it may be argued there was " no significant sexual element " to his crime .
Sheriff Alistair Car@@ m@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ el deferred sentence until October for social work background reports .
H@@ o@@ gg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody ahead of hear@@ ings on other outstanding cases .
He was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of his sentencing date .
Tra@@ f@@ f@@ ick@@ ers move towards Germany over minor border cross@@ ings .
More and more refugees are being picked up away from major control points on the Ger@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Austrian border .

Following the r@@ e@@ introduction of controls on the Ger@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Austrian borders , 1,75@@ 9 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : tail end of tropical storm " Henry " expected in the south west
M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ o@@ r@@ ologists are warning of squ@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s in the south west from Wednesday evening o@@ n@@ wards .
Due to a depression over western Europe at the moment , warm sea air is flowing into the country , the German Meteorological service ( D@@ W@@ D ) has advised .
The powerful trou@@ gh is the tail end of tropical storm " Henry , " which has moved over the Atlantic from the Bermud@@ a Is@@ lands in the last few days .

The c@@ h@@ assi@@ s makes the difference : every two years car manufacturers present their new models at the IA@@ A
In 20@@ 15 movement can be noticed in particular in compact cars , which are selling especially well at the moment .
Comp@@ act class cars are currently very much in demand : according to the Federal Office for Motor Transport ( K@@ BA ) about 28.@@ 1 percent of new regist@@ rations in August alone belon@@ ged to this segment .
This is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
In among all the fut@@ u@@ r@@ istic concept vehicles and the new high-end and luxury models , this year above all it is new compact models which are being introduced .
One of the biggest prem@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ es for the German car sector here is the O@@ pel A@@ stra , which hits the car deal@@ erships in the autum@@ n .
" The A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , " said O@@ pel boss Kar@@ l-@@ Thomas N@@ e@@ u@@ m@@ ann at the show .
It is at the heart of the brand .
To ensure that it sells well , the price of the new A@@ stra is not increasing significantly .
O@@ pel p@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ es an entry point below that of its main compet@@ itor , the VW Golf , which starts at € 17,@@ 650 .
The latest A@@ stra costs from € 16,@@ 9@@ 90 .
With a new 1.4 litre engine , the A@@ stra has an output of 74 k@@ w / 100 h@@ p .
The H@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ an manufacturer also offers diesel and petrol engines from 70 k@@ w / 95 h@@ p to 14@@ 7 k@@ w / 200 h@@ p , including the first three cy@@ l@@ i@@ n@@ der petrol model .
Unlike its most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , for the first time the O@@ pel A@@ stra is only available as a five door .
In spring the estate car , already seen at the IA@@ A , will follow as the second option
And what other compact cars are being introduced alongside the A@@ stra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault M@@ é@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ e : Renault introduces the fourth generation of its compet@@ itor to the A@@ stra , the M@@ é@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ e , into the race .
The M@@ é@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ e can be seen at the show exclusively as a five-@@ door , in a conven@@ tional and a distinc@@ tly spor@@ ty version .
It will be available in deal@@ erships at the beginning of next year , then also as an estate model .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in this segment .
The Nissan o@@ f@@ f@@ shoot is looking to find its place in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
The compact Infin@@ iti , with its c@@ u@@ r@@ ved lines , fits right into the design line of the brand .
The basic model will have a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 k@@ w / 122 h@@ p .
A diesel with 80 k@@ w / 109 h@@ p or 125 k@@ w / 170 h@@ p is also on offer .
Suzuki Bal@@ e@@ n@@ o : also new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ e@@ n@@ o , which celeb@@ rates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
On offer is the petrol engine model , including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo engine and a performance of 82 k@@ w / 1@@ 11 h@@ p .
According to the m@@ a@@ n@@ fac@@ turer 's spec@@ ific@@ ations , the maximum tor@@ que is 170 New@@ ton metres ( N@@ m ) .
The Bal@@ e@@ n@@ o is launched in Europe in early 20@@ 16 .
DS@@ 4 : not totally new , but completely redesigned , is the DS 4 compact car model , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
The desig@@ ners at the class@@ y Cit@@ r@@ o@@ ë@@ n o@@ f@@ f@@ shoot have turned their hand primarily to the front end : here the radi@@ ator g@@ r@@ ille has been newly designed and the modified head@@ lights have been equipped with L@@ ED technology .
In the i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ior the i@@ n@@ f@@ o@@ tainment system in particular has been moder@@ nis@@ ed , the number of but@@ tons on the touch screen has been reduced and for the first time Apple 's Car@@ Play has been incorpor@@ ated .
In the compact class the IA@@ A also features a string of revised and new versions such as the updated Mercedes A Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five-@@ squ@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ -@@ met@@ re cells are u@@ n@@ fit for human beings
The Federal Const@@ itu@@ tional Court has upheld a complaint by a former i@@ n@@ mate of Te@@ gel prison that he had been housed for months in too small a cell .
In principle , prisoners have a right to financial compensation for violation to their human dignity if they are kept in cells which are too small .
The Federal Const@@ itu@@ tional Court reached this decision in a public ruling on Wednesday .
According to the judge , those affected can actually hope for money if they have been shut in too small a room for only a few days ( r@@ e@@ f : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 12@@ 7 / 14 ) .
For this reason a former prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Kar@@ ls@@ r@@ u@@ he . He was detained in Berlin Te@@ gel prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a floor area of around five square metres : the toilet was not in a separate room .
Afterwards the man , who according to a statement by his lawyer has since been released , was trans@@ ferred to a larger cell .
His liability claim against the state of Berlin by reason of u@@ n@@ suitable prison conditions however , failed .
But the constitutional judges set aside the judgement of the Supreme Court in Berlin and r@@ e@@ submitted the case there for renewed assessment .
In their view the human dignity of the man had been violated .
The Supreme Court is now deci@@ ding the amount of the damages .
Even if for legal reasons only a few days of the period in custody are significant for compensation , entit@@ lement to a claim for compensation exists .
Otherwise there would be " fears of deterior@@ ation of a person 's right to protection . "
The Supreme Court must now settle the amount of pec@@ uni@@ ary compensation .
Const@@ itu@@ tional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
As recently as April they awarded damages to a prisoner because he had been locked in his cell naked .
A cell with multiple fun@@ ctions and without a separate toilet is also inhumane , according to a decision from 2011 .
Fur@@ ther@@ more Kar@@ ls@@ r@@ u@@ he confirmed on Wednesday that in addition , according to the Berlin Const@@ itu@@ tional Court , a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 had a@@ t@@ tested to inhumane accommod@@ ation
The prisoner at that time was kept in a similar cell to that in the Kar@@ ls@@ r@@ u@@ he case daily between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. for over three months
Berlin prisons have also hit the headlines in the last few weeks due to lack of staff .
Because of this , prisoners are time and again locked up for 23 hours , aggres@@ s@@ i@@ veness rises and it has even led to bra@@ wls due to the tense situation .
According to information from the press office of the public prosecutor , 21 positions in Te@@ gel have not been filled due to a lack of young people , and 19 will ce@@ ase to exist in 20@@ 16 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : " We can handle it "
The influ@@ x of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
What changes will we see in Germany ?
According to the predic@@ tions of the Federal Minister of the Interior , around 800,000 asyl@@ um see@@ kers will arrive in Germany this year , and according to a statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( S@@ P@@ D ) , Germany is actually in a position to take in a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of this unusual challenge . " I say again and again : we can handle it , and we will handle it . "
The following is a summary of what is coming to Germany .
According to various forecasts between 350,000 ( e@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ ation by the Ministry of buildings ) and 400,000 ( e@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ ation by the P@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ el Institute ) homes will be needed annually - and in fact for the next five years .
That is twice as many as are being built at the moment ( 25@@ 0,000 homes ) .
The lack of living space is dramatic but above all for affordable rental properties : between 60,000 and 80,000 social d@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ings per year are excluded from rent control and refugees will also compete for these particularly cheap homes .
Federal building minister Barbara Hend@@ r@@ i@@ cks ( S@@ P@@ D ) thus wants to double funding from the current € 5@@ 18 million to € 1 billion .
In the view of the P@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ el Institute this is far too little : 80,000 social d@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ings must be developed annually and for this the government must invest a sum of € 6.4 billion per year .
Academ@@ ics and the Federal Building Ministry agree that as well as this more tax benefits must be provided for investment in the building of housing .
According to estimates by the Institute for Emp@@ loy@@ ment Research , it could be expected that in the long term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany should be able to work .
However the refugees in Germany are not being s@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ m@@ atically asked about their quali@@ fic@@ ations so as to be able to help them get started , criticised C@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ dia Walter , project manager for integration and training in the B@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ mann Foundation .
But it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
Work is the key to social contact and to appreciation of the host society , and also to the self-@@ este@@ em of the immigrant says mig@@ ration researcher Die@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ ch T@@ h@@ r@@ ä@@ n@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ t .
According to T@@ h@@ r@@ ä@@ n@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ t , a political shift has taken place in Germany : from a ban on employment for refugees to an appreciation of work .
While in the past asyl@@ um see@@ kers were forbidden to work for up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as with the residence obligation which limits asyl@@ um see@@ kers to one place of dom@@ i@@ c@@ ile .
As far as the majority of society is now concerned , particularly in view of skills shortage , refugees should be allowed to gain faster access to the job market .
One big obstac@@ le to access to the jobs market is the lack of knowledge of the German language .
To date there is still no adequate supply of general and work@@ -related language courses .
Stu@@ dies also show that jobs are most often found through personal contact .
Thus , in T@@ h@@ r@@ ä@@ n@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ t 's view , the building of networks is the ideal solution to work integration .
The Berlin school administration has noticed that only a few refugee parents have placed their children in kin@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ garten ; an estimated one to 15 percent . " For the u@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ o@@ ted parents their first priority is to keep the family together , " says Il@@ ja Ko@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ m@@ bar , spokesman for youth and family affairs in the Berlin Senate administration .
To be able to conv@@ ince families of the benefits of kin@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ gar@@ tens , the administration is issu@@ ing leaf@@ lets in a number of languages .
If the need for teachers increases sharply because of the large number of refugees the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacity , for example by allowing for more technical colleges .
In the states , pup@@ ils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcoming classes .
However they will not always be taught by fully qualified teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a quali@@ fication in German as a second language .
There is no shortage of these , says B@@ e@@ ate S@@ t@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
The German student services estimate that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
In principle no federal state prohib@@ its asyl@@ um see@@ kers or those with long-term refugee status from studying - the only exception up to now was Berlin : Senator for the Interior Frank H@@ enk@@ el ( CD@@ U ) has however now abandoned his stance .
Refugees who want to study may have their entrance to university fac@@ ilit@@ ated .
Refugees with a residence permit or protection against deport@@ ation no longer receive benefits according to the asyl@@ um see@@ kers benefits act if they begin a course of study .
In principle the latter receive no grant , as they do not fall into the category of persons entitled to a grant .
Tol@@ e@@ r@@ ated refugees up to now must have lived for years in Germany in order to be entitled to a grant ; from 1 January 20@@ 16 this period is reduced to 15 months .
But this financing gap must also be closed , claim Ste@@ f@@ f@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin 's State Secretary for Science , and the German student services .
The students should receive a grant immediately .
Islam will play an important role in the future as the refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have and the existing state-@@ church law should be developed into a state-@@ religion relationship .
The founding of an Islamic welfare organisation , which looks after new arri@@ vals in a professional manner , is also important .
Rights also involve r@@ e@@ spon@@ s@@ i@@ bil@@ ities .
Thus the representatives of Islam must agree to clear points of contact and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to conce@@ de certain control options .
This also requires the readiness to act cour@@ age@@ ously against religious fundam@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ ism .
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ i@@ m@@ an Ma@@ z@@ yek , expressed the fear on Thursday that religious conflict could also be brought to Germany .
Those who want to wage such conflict in Germany " have immediately forfeit@@ ed their right to stay here in Germany , " he said on Bav@@ arian radio .
He suggested trans@@ l@@ ating this basic law into Arabic .
In the future integration will be a topic for the whole of society even more than it is today .
This means too that mainstream society will have to change and the removal of discrimination and rac@@ ism is becoming more urgent .
For nearly 10 years , as a result of European rul@@ ings , Germany has had an anti-@@ discrimination agency and a general equality act .
But it is learning very slowly , as the NS@@ U murder series shows , that rac@@ ist m@@ o@@ tives are s@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ m@@ atically ignored in the police and the authorities .
Equ@@ al opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organis@@ ations and non-@@ white German pressure groups have demanded for a long time , and to which international t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ es such as the anti rac@@ ism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next 10 years if the country wants to remain at peace and to exploit the opportunities of its new citizens - for the good of everyone .
Germany is in a position generally to provide medical care for the refugees expected up to now , is the opinion of the president of the Doctors ' Association , Frank Ulrich Montgomery .
" As far as manpower and capacity are concerned , we can cope , " he told the Tag@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ e@@ gel .
However extra money must be added to the system for this .
In order to avoid bott@@ len@@ e@@ c@@ ks , Montgomery asked for all new arri@@ vals to be issued with healthcare cards when they register .
Services provided can be accounted for with the Federal states later .
And in the long term it is highly doub@@ tful that so many people can be f@@ o@@ b@@ bed off with the limited catalogue of services for which the Benef@@ its for A@@ s@@ y@@ l@@ um Se@@ ek@@ ers Act provides .
Apart from this , doctors are making it their priority to deal with the language bar@@ rier .
Up to now , as Berlin health researcher T@@ h@@ e@@ a Bor@@ de has established , mig@@ rants have received poor@@ er information about their illnesses than other patients .
Interpre@@ ters must be taken on not only in hospitals but also in doctors ' practices , she demands .
But many refugees would also already be helped with more general medicine d@@ rop@@ -in cent@@ res in emergency rooms .
And with a different diagno@@ stic view .
R@@ e@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e children for example clearly suffer from more untreated disabilities , and with young people it is more a case of information about HIV .
German doctors though are able to use their training to deal with the partly different disease patterns , said Montgomery
" P@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ s@@ ite infections or tubercu@@ losis are not that difficult to recognise . " And because of the refugees there is possibly relief in sight for the shortage of doctors .
Syria has a highly developed educational system and a number of refugees are expected to be doctors .
To be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their quali@@ fic@@ ations and possibly take more e@@ x@@ ams .
In the e@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ ation of the Federal P@@ s@@ y@@ cho@@ therap@@ e@@ u@@ tic Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most of them are suffering from post-@@ traumatic stress disorder or depression .
R@@ e@@ f@@ u@@ g@@ e@@ e children are particularly vulnerable , explains Die@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ ch Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
A s@@ o@@ on-@@ to-@@ be published study by the T@@ U in Mun@@ ich documents that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives t@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ ised in Germany .
Those who suffer from post-@@ traumatic stress disorder suffer among other things from so-called flas@@ h@@ backs , difficulties in breathing , d@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fear of death .
Further symptoms are sleep and concentr@@ ation disorders , ner@@ v@@ o@@ u@@ s@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
In order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
Up to now , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
M@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ally ill asyl@@ um see@@ kers are permitted to make an application with the social security services for psycho@@ therapy , but processing usually takes several months .
In addition , it is mostly officials or doctors in the social services who are not trained in psych@@ ological illnesses who decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
This frequently leads to false a@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .
The ring i@@ n@@ v@@ ites you to dream
With their new " Pas@@ sion " production , C@@ i@@ r@@ cus P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st is returning to the traditions of the art of the cir@@ cus .
The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of mes@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ ising acrob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
Now C@@ i@@ r@@ cus P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st is issu@@ ing an invitation to dream in the ring at the Z@@ i@@ e@@ g@@ e@@ l@@ was@@ en .
" Our passion is our cir@@ cus . "
" I couldn 't imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , " says Stephanie P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st , animal t@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ er and junior manager .
" Pas@@ sion " - this is the m@@ o@@ t@@ to for the current production in the ring .
The cir@@ cus has been owned by the P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st family for over 33 years .
The family has the gift of enth@@ r@@ alling people in their blood .
" It 's important for us to take people away from their daily lives and to take them with us into another world for two hours , " stres@@ ses the 27@@ -year-old junior manager .
Director Rein@@ hard P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st calls his concept a " C@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ tail in the ring with a cosm@@ opolit@@ an fla@@ ir . "
Fif@@ ty towns have the chance to experience this fla@@ ir on the almost 3@@ 000 kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ re-@@ long tour .
The cir@@ cus programme wins people over with talented artists from all over the world .
Dist@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ uished at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ l@@ i@@ aro@@ v c@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ n family cap@@ tivate the public with wit and charm .
The Cast@@ illo brothers , too , know their craft .
The Cuban duo are ready to compete with the heroes of silent films .
Ligh@@ tness and a@@ g@@ ility - these words sum them up .
Their hum@@ o@@ r@@ ous arti@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ y on the p@@ o@@ l@@ e will win the women 's hearts .
Apart from causing numerous bursts of laugh@@ ter , the C@@ i@@ r@@ cus P@@ r@@ o@@ st 's acrob@@ ats are also mes@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ ising with their finesse and sup@@ p@@ l@@ eness .
Bal@@ anc@@ ing on a ball with a u@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ ycle ?
No problem for He Yu@@ an .
C@@ o@@ n@@ tor@@ tion@@ ists enth@@ r@@ all and terri@@ fy at the same time .
Wang L@@ in , from China , is better acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ted with the oldest form of acrob@@ atics than most and thr@@ ills with his flexibility .
Six@@ ty enter@@ tain@@ ers from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect .
" The animals belong to our family , " insists Stap@@ han@@ ie 's mother , Bri@@ g@@ i@@ t@@ te P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st .
Differ@@ ent animal welfare organis@@ ations all too often complain about mist@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ ment of cir@@ cus animals .
Stephanie P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st has her own answer to this : " If our animals aren 't happy , then nor are we . "
About 80 animals from five different cont@@ i@@ n@@ ents enjoy every bit of attention .
The " four-@@ leg@@ ged arti@@ s@@ t@@ es " as they are affection@@ ately known , have their every wish fulfilled as far as possible .
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them .
If the animal doesn 't feel well , it doesn 't want to go in the ring either .
So the top priority is to look after the animals well .
The P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st family are especially proud of their zeb@@ r@@ o@@ id , J@@ u@@ m@@ bo - the offspring of a Sh@@ e@@ t@@ land p@@ ony s@@ t@@ alli@@ on and a zeb@@ ra m@@ are .
The two animals lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
" Then suddenly there was our little J@@ u@@ m@@ bo , " says Bri@@ g@@ i@@ t@@ te P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st .
But the zeb@@ r@@ o@@ id is not yet ready for the ring , instead he is a unique little mascot for the C@@ i@@ r@@ cus P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st .
There is something for every visitor .
" One thing is for certain , " says Stephanie P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st , " regardless of whether there are five or 1,200 people in the audience , we give them our best and do it with all of our hearts .
C@@ i@@ r@@ cus P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ st i@@ n@@ v@@ ites you to come and see their show every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m .
The programme begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Sunday .
Thursday is family day ; there is a discount on the price of the show .
And the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe , Africa 's oldest leader , earlier this year fell down the steps leading from a podium .
He was u@@ n@@ hurt , but video of the fall went viral on social media .
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by claims by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against boo@@ ing Mr Mugabe during his address .
Last month , they boo@@ ed and hec@@ kled him during his state of the nation address in parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) chief w@@ h@@ ip Innocent G@@ o@@ n@@ ese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt N@@ r Mugabe 's address .
" The message is coming from a number which is not reflecting but it 's titled ' death ' , " he told journalists after Mr Mugabe 's speech .
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends at parliament and once they step out of parliament that parliamentary immunity does not operate .
The chief w@@ h@@ ip said the party , led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ g@@ i@@ r@@ a@@ i , is " worried " about the threats to its politicians .
He@@ wle@@ t@@ t@@ -P@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ wle@@ t@@ t@@ -P@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ard expects to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-@@ saving efforts at it enterprise services business .
HP is splitting into two listed companies later this year , separ@@ ating its computer and prin@@ ter businesses from its fast@@ er-@@ growing corporate hardware and services operations .
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of about $ 2.@@ 7@@ bn , beginning in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
" These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive , sustain@@ able cost structure for the new He@@ wle@@ tt P@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ard Enter@@ prise , " said M@@ e@@ g Whit@@ man , the HP chairman and chief executive who will head the unit after the split .
" He@@ wle@@ tt P@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ard Enter@@ prise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to the new style of business , " said Whit@@ man .
As a separate company , we are better position@@ ed than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ wle@@ tt P@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ard Enter@@ prise will have more than $ 50@@ bn in annual revenue and " will be focused on delivering u@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ val@@ ed integrated technology solutions " to companies , according to a company statement .
It breaks up a company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill He@@ wle@@ tt and Dave P@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ard to make electric equipment , and whose Pal@@ o Alto gar@@ age has been dubbed " the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . "
HP has been undergoing a massive reorganisation to cope with the move away from traditional personal computers to mobile devices .
The move by HP , the world 's second-@@ largest PC maker and one of the biggest US tech firms , is the latest in the sector based on the belief that tigh@@ tly focused firms perform better .
Arsenal captain Mik@@ el A@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ ta says team@@ -@@ m@@ ates must get behind injured Jack Wil@@ shere ahead of D@@ i@@ n@@ amo Z@@ agre@@ b tie
Wen@@ ger has also stressed to Wil@@ shere that it is still only September and , providing his rehabilitation goes to plan , there is no reason why he cannot be back playing by Christmas .
That best-@@ case scenario already means that Wil@@ shere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and , given his history , his involvement in next summer 's European Championship is clearly uncertain .
The great shame of this latest problem is that Wil@@ shere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then looked back to his old shar@@ p@@ ness during pre-@@ season .
" This kind of injury is not care@@ er-@@ threatening , " said Wen@@ ger .
It is a bone that did not heal well .
It is nothing major .
This was just an accident .
It was not linked with his ankles or with the injuries he had before .
That might be true from a pu@@ rely medical perspective but , as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the related danger of further injuries whenever any player tries to return mid@@ season .
There is also an uncomfortable pattern developing .
Research by Premier I@@ n@@ j@@ u@@ r@@ ies Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ shere ail@@ ments since he made his debut six years ago .
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal 's 157 league games during the last five seasons .
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-@@ 08 , they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to lose most days through injury .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe that an improvement in their injury record during last season will continue .
" Sometimes , when you are coming back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition , " said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to get over that .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident it will and he will make a career of the kind he deserves .
With Arsenal beginning their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against D@@ i@@ n@@ amo Z@@ agre@@ b ahead of matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday , Wen@@ ger is preparing to rot@@ ate his team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ e@@ r@@ í@@ n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ thie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and A@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ ta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger may also begin with Kier@@ an Gibbs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ d in place of N@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ o M@@ o@@ n@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
" I try to keep the balance and give a little bre@@ ather to players who need it , " said Wen@@ ger .
Although Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites to progress through Group F , the Mak@@ s@@ i@@ m@@ ir stadium in Z@@ agre@@ b is among Europe 's most intimid@@ ating .
D@@ i@@ n@@ amo are also unbeaten in 41 matches after producing their own " I@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ ble " campaign last season .
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earth t@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ or that measured 3.@@ 2 on the Richter .
It was the 10th in Z@@ agre@@ b this year .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal have lear@@ nt the lesson of last season 's Champions League cap@@ i@@ t@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of managing the club to a first European Cup triumph .
" This drive is immense , " said Wen@@ ger .
It has never been done at Arsenal .
We were very close in 2006 but , on the other hand , I am long enough to be real@@ istic .
We are ambitious but we are not d@@ r@@ e@@ amers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est : the comedy show that taught us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is glar@@ ing , particularly given how the need for men to open up is more desperate now than ever , with suicide rates among@@ st young m@@ ales at 15 year high .
In 20@@ 13 , it was the single biggest cause of death in men aged 20-@@ 45 in the UK , and remains three times more common in m@@ ales than f@@ e@@ m@@ ales .
In a bid to address the problem , the Camp@@ aign Against Li@@ ving Mis@@ e@@ r@@ ably ( CAL@@ M ) announced 20@@ 15 as the Year of the M@@ ale , aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it .
Friendship lies at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge .
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-@@ school students disp@@ l@@ a@@ ying depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ e@@ r@@ er had a high enough percentage of " healthy mood " friends , their chances of recovering doubled .
Equ@@ ally , for those not depressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends h@@ a@@ l@@ ved the chances of mental challenges a@@ r@@ ising .
But of course , for friendship to work , it needs to be accessible in the first place .
In this age of soci@@ al-@@ media led communication , with its focus on style over substance , i@@ m@@ medi@@ acy of response is often p@@ r@@ i@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ ised over meaningful contact .
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun@@ -@@ loving and successful , even if in reality isolation is king .
This super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists term e@@ x@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner year@@ ning for personal growth and friendship - that more deeply imp@@ acts our mental health .
And as a billionaire vide@@ o-@@ game creator explained recently , money really doesn 't buy greater happ@@ iness .
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focus on its head .
Each of the characters were not defined by their work , but rather their person@@ alities , which s@@ h@@ one through the interaction as friends .
The hum@@ our of Joey and Chandler 's frequent hu@@ gs , moments watching football on the c@@ o@@ m@@ fy chairs , and Ross 's p@@ ining for Rach@@ el , came from the knowledge that yes , men can all rel@@ ate to this , even if they often hold back from fully expl@@ oring their feelings .
As a Sam@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ an worker explained to me : .... " my listening role to people feeling depressed and s@@ u@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ al has really highlighted how even the small@@ est interactions from friends can make a difference . "
O@@ f@@ ten the men who contact us feel unable to speak to friends .
The old a@@ d@@ age of " getting on with it " is strong , as is the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems . "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try and offer more long-term cop@@ ing mechan@@ isms .
It highlighted the little moments of male friendship .
As much as my objective , out@@ sider status over the phone helps people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long-term support comes from a close , personal family and friend network .
And so , if you attend Comedy Central 's Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est this weekend , with the sets fully redesigned in celebration , why not take your friends for a drink at Central Per@@ k .
Or , better still , if in Starbucks you see someone alone , give a smile and say hello .
You never know what difference your friendship could make .
Friends is broadcasting on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ F@@ est
Di Maria scores to help P@@ S@@ G sw@@ at aside Mal@@ mo
Angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ idi and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after scoring against Mal@@ mo .
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help P@@ S@@ G ease past Swedish side Mal@@ mo on Tuesday .
Here 's the match report and reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on target as Paris S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t-@@ Ger@@ main began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Mal@@ mo at the P@@ a@@ r@@ c des Princ@@ es on Tuesday .
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a P@@ S@@ G player to set the French champions on their way , but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally exten@@ ding their advantage when Cav@@ ani headed home in the 6@@ 1st minute .
With Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ ar Don@@ e@@ t@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just quali@@ fication for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-@@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
But while they got the points , it was not a vin@@ tage display by Lau@@ rent Blanc 's side with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic wast@@ eful in front of goal and later being subst@@ i@@ t@@ uted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illu@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ ous career back in 1999 .
" It 's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League , so to win 2-0 , cause our opponents problems and look comfortable at the back is a good start even if there are certain things we will need to perfect as the season goes on , " said Blanc .
It a@@ u@@ g@@ urs well .
We wanted to win and we did , although I regret that we did not score one or two goals more .
I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-@@ 2 draw at home by Bor@@ d@@ e@@ aux in Lig@@ ue 1 at the weekend , but he was up@@ staged in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
The Argentina winger was lab@@ elled as the man to take P@@ S@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month , and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco V@@ e@@ r@@ r@@ atti 's pass in behind the Mal@@ mo defence before a@@ n@@ g@@ ling a beautiful finish past Joh@@ an Wil@@ and and into the far corner of the net .
However , if anyone then expected P@@ S@@ G to r@@ o@@ m@@ p to a big victory , they were to be disappointed .
Mal@@ mo , who beat Celtic in a play@@ -off to reach this stage , lined up with nine full i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ nation@@ als on the field at kick@@ -off and , with a five-@@ man defence and two deep in midfield , were stu@@ f@@ f@@ y opponents .
But , save for a Nik@@ ola D@@ j@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ j@@ ic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Tra@@ p@@ p 's far post in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in attack .
Instead , P@@ S@@ G let themselves down at times with some wast@@ eful passing and poor finishing , not least from I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic , who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cav@@ ani just after the restart .
Nevertheless , he proved much more a@@ d@@ e@@ pt when it came to setting up his colleagues , and it was from an I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic pass that Di Maria sent in a c@@ u@@ r@@ ling shot which was t@@ i@@ pped around the post by Wil@@ and on 52 minutes .
The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani , the U@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ u@@ a@@ y@@ an heading home his sixth of the season after I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic had fli@@ cked on a left-wing cross from Max@@ well .
That ended any ideas that Mal@@ mo had of coming back into the game , and only a super@@ b stop by Wil@@ and from poin@@ t-@@ blan@@ k range to deny David Lu@@ iz kept the final score down before substitute E@@ ze@@ q@@ u@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ z@@ z@@ i had a goal dis@@ allowed right at the death .
Mal@@ mo coach A@@ ge Ha@@ r@@ e@@ i@@ de later admitted P@@ S@@ G were a class above his side , the Norwegian saying : " Our last Champions League game was in December last year . "
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level .
The qualifi@@ ers are not enough .
H@@ ats off to Paris .
It was a magn@@ ific@@ ent match from them .
Gl@@ e@@ n@@ core raises $ 2.5 billion in share sales
Swis@@ s-@@ based mining giant Gl@@ e@@ n@@ core , hit by collapsing commodities prices , on Wednesday raised $ 2.5 billion via a shares sale as part of its vast deb@@ t-@@ s@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ h@@ ing plan .
Lon@@ d@@ on-@@ listed Gl@@ e@@ n@@ core said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay down debt .
The company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is grap@@ pling with tum@@ bling commodity prices as China 's economic slowdown weigh@@ s on demand and sparks havoc across markets .
The rights issue sent Gl@@ e@@ n@@ core 's share price soaring to the top of the London stock market in early morning deals on Wednesday .
Shares jumped 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0@@ .@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ e@@ n@@ core had last week revealed the $ 2.@@ 5-@@ billion shares sale as part of broader plans to s@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ h its $ 30 billion debt pile by about a third .
The company sold the new stock at 125 p@@ ence per share , which marked a 2.@@ 4-@@ percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday .
It o@@ f@@ f@@ loaded 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
Conc@@ erns over prolonged stalled Chinese growth have s@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ hed iron ore prices by roughly a half , as coal , copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent .
Refugees arrive in W@@ e@@ i@@ mar
On Tuesday afternoon 49 people reach the mun@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality of W@@ e@@ i@@ mar after a mostly long flight .
The refugees come from Syria , Alban@@ ia , Afghanistan , Mac@@ edonia and Somalia .
The youngest arrival is a six month old girl from Syria .
White House C@@ o@@ n@@ firms Xi J@@ i@@ n@@ ping 's Washington Visit
Chinese President Xi J@@ i@@ n@@ ping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday .
The visit , Xi 's first official one to Washington , will take place on Sept . 25 and r@@ e@@ c@@ i@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama 's trip to Beijing last November , the statement said .
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ yuan at a state dinner that evening , after the two leaders have engaged in bilateral talks .
" President Xi 's visit will present an opportunity to expand U.S.-@@ China cooperation on a range of global , regional , and bilateral issues of mut@@ ual interest , while also enabling President Obama and President Xi to address areas of disa@@ gre@@ ement construc@@ tively , " the statement added .
Xi , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to stop in Seattle to meet several U.S. tech leaders on his way to Washington , before going on to New York City for the U.N. General Assembly on Sept .
Obama and Xi are expected to bro@@ ach a range of conten@@ tious issues , including Washington 's concerns over China 's alleged cy@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ espionage and its increasing asser@@ tiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea .
4@@ 40 h@@ p sports car rented and written off
A 29-year-old wanted to ful@@ fil a dream and rented a Ford Must@@ a@@ n@@ g .
He got a rude aw@@ akening on the wet motorway .
A company in the district of Go@@ tha allows you to ful@@ fil your dream by renting out and driving an American V@@ 8 Ford Must@@ a@@ n@@ g Boss 3@@ 02 4@@ 40 h@@ p sports car .
So the 29-year-old from the Go@@ tha district did just that .
The end of his dream came on the A 71 motorway near Arn@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ t .
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car , got into a skid on the wet road and drove into the crash bar@@ rier .
The sports car was a writ@@ e@@ -@@ off but no one was injured .
Dam@@ age is estimated at € 40,000 .
X@@ avi : Pe@@ p Guar@@ d@@ i@@ ola prevented switch to FC Bay@@ ern in 2008
World and European champion X@@ avi has played for the al-@@ Sad@@ d Sport Club in Qatar since summer 20@@ 15 .
A few years ago , FC Bay@@ ern was apparently close to commit@@ ting to Spain 's super@@ star X@@ avi , who at the time was playing for FC Barcelona .
Eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times Champions League winner , twice club world champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - X@@ avi 's list of titles is breath@@ -@@ taking .
In the summer the then 35@@ -year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and trans@@ ferred to Qatar and the al-@@ Sad@@ d Sport Club .
But in an interview with M@@ a@@ r@@ ca , X@@ avi reveals now that just before the 2008 European Championship he was ready to leave Barcelona .
" I was told that Bar@@ ç@@ a wanted to sell me . "
" At the time Madrid were winning everything and we weren 't , " he says .
And FC Bay@@ ern noticed that too .
X@@ avi : " There was an offer from Bay@@ ern . "
" Rum@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ g@@ ge wanted to have me . "
A quick reminder : in the summer of 2008 , J@@ ü@@ r@@ gen Klin@@ s@@ mann took over at FC Bay@@ ern .
Guar@@ d@@ i@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not transfer .
The transfer never happened .
And instead the crucial man now works for the German record champion : Pe@@ p Guar@@ d@@ i@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why . " Bar@@ ç@@ a had signed on Guar@@ d@@ i@@ ola and I played a brilliant European Championship . "
" Pep@@ e told me that I shouldn 't transfer , that he couldn 't imagine the team without me . "
" He got me with that . "
Who knows how Bay@@ ern 's 2008 / 2009 season would have turned out if X@@ avi had left .
X@@ avi covered the entire distance on the turf for Bar@@ ç@@ a in the quarter final of the Champions League against Bay@@ ern , knocked the Reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the premiere class triumph .
Matt Damon down@@ plays diversity in film@@ making
Matt Damon confron@@ ted African-American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity saying it wasn 't needed behind the scenes .
During Sunday night 's episode of HBO 's Project Green@@ light , the seasoned actor cut Brown off while she was emp@@ h@@ a@@ s@@ i@@ zing the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black p@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ a@@ g@@ o@@ n@@ ist in the project 's chosen scre@@ e@@ n@@ play .
" When we 're talking about diversity you do it in the casting of the film not in the casting of the show , " Damon asserted .
Sho@@ cked , Brown reacted with offended dis@@ belief , letting out " H@@ o@@ o ! Wo@@ w . Ok@@ ay , " as The M@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ an actor 's comments settled in the air .
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ e@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show 's finalists .
" I would urge people to think about -- whoever the director is , how they 're going to treat the character of Harmony , " Brown initially said .
The only black character who 's a hooker who gets hit by her white p@@ i@@ m@@ p .
The Dear White People producer pushed for finalists L@@ e@@ o Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the rights to direct the film ; Damon r@@ e@@ tor@@ ted their directing could " end up giving us something we don 't want . "
After the discussion aired , social media exploded in disap@@ proval over Damon 's comments .
Twit@@ ter user M@@ r@@ P@@ o@@ oni expressed anger toward the cli@@ p writing , " Matt Damon speaking over the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her is S@@ O WHIT@@ E it hurts . "
The t@@ w@@ e@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ w@@ e@@ ets and 4,000 likes since being posted .
Damon 's comments come at a time where accur@@ ate racial representation in media is at the forefron@@ t of social discussion .
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement took nationwide effect , urging lawmakers and authorities to halt discrimin@@ atory practices against people of color .
In February , singer Prince alluded to the movement while intro@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ing the nominees of Alb@@ um of the Year at the Grammy Awards .
" Alb@@ ums still matter , " he said .
Like books and black lives , albums still matter .
More recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality El@@ i@@ s@@ a@@ b@@ e@@ th Has@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ b@@ e@@ ck 's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group .
" The Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Network is a love group , " leaders said .
Damon was recently announced as one of a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media m@@ o@@ gul@@ s invited to visit the Pop@@ e to discuss the Catholic Church 's portrayal in the West .
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pop@@ e is unclear .
'@@ American N@@ i@@ n@@ ja War@@ r@@ i@@ or ' crow@@ ns first champion
P@@ r@@ o@@ -@@ rock clim@@ ber and bus@@ boy Isa@@ ac Cal@@ d@@ i@@ ero became the first athle@@ te to win American N@@ i@@ n@@ ja War@@ r@@ i@@ or Monday night taking home the $ 1 million grand prize .
The competition show , which just wrapped up its 7th season , has never seen any compet@@ itor complete all stages of its obstac@@ le course .
During the season finale , two men , Cal@@ d@@ i@@ ero and cameraman Geoff Brit@@ ten , made it to the final round .
The final task involved climbing a 75@@ -@@ foot rop@@ e in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten went first completing the challenge on time , making him the first-@@ ever athle@@ te to complete American N@@ i@@ n@@ ja War@@ r@@ i@@ or 's gru@@ e@@ l@@ ing stage 4 , however , Cal@@ d@@ i@@ ero finished the challenge a full three seconds faster making him the winner .
Cal@@ d@@ i@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard-@@ fought victory , still in shock about winning the $ 1 million grand prize .
" I mean it 's amazing to think about , like I 've never made or lived off more than $ 10,000 a year , " Isa@@ ac told E ! of his serious pay-@@ b@@ ump .
So to all of a sudden ... like I can 't even imagine what it 's going to be like ... the future is unknown .
Executive producer Kent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why , despite Brit@@ ten being the first ever compet@@ itor to finish the course , won 't be awarded any prize money .
By the rules , the money goes to the fast@@ est person .
" If there 's more than one finisher , the one with the fast@@ est time gets it , " said We@@ ed .
As much as the money is a wonderful prize and life changing , he does get the great grati@@ fication .
I don 't think he h@@ a@@ r@@ b@@ ors any ill will about it .
He 's just so happy to have done what he 's done .
He 's received tons of a@@ c@@ c@@ o@@ l@@ ades from fans .
He 's such a great guy , and a family man .
He 's a hero to his kids and his wife .
Geoff said to me , " If I was going to be beat by someone , I 'm glad it 's Isa@@ ac . "
And I think Isa@@ ac would have felt the same way if they roles were reversed .
America N@@ i@@ n@@ ja War@@ r@@ i@@ or was renewed for an eighth season , which will begin fil@@ ming in Spring 20@@ 16 .
Detroit Tigers t@@ i@@ p@@ toe past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half the season hasn 't been a lot of fun for the Detroit Tigers .
Once one of the best teams in baseball , the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central .
Reduc@@ ing to being a spo@@ i@@ l@@ er , the Tigers played the part perfectly Tuesday , beating the Minnesota Twins 5-@@ 4 at Tar@@ get Field .
The Twins squ@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ed a chance to climb to within one-@@ half game of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild-card spot .
For Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three-@@ letter F-@@ word that has been so e@@ l@@ u@@ sive over much of the season 's second half .
" All wins are fun , no matter how it happens , " Tigers manager Brad A@@ u@@ s@@ m@@ us said .
Tigers pitcher Alfre@@ do Simon made his early offensive support hold up , as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings , then t@@ acked one in the sixth and one more in the ninth .
Simon ( 13-@@ 9 ) pitched 6 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs .
It was only his third quality start in his past nine out@@ ings .
" I just want to finish strong this year , " Simon said .
It 's hard for the bullpen to throw every game , and that 's why I want to go deep into the game .
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs , his first RBIs since mid-@@ August .
It was Martinez 's first three-@@ hit night since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6 .
" He sw@@ ung the bat well , " A@@ u@@ s@@ m@@ us said .
He looked good in ( batting practice ) , looked noti@@ ce@@ ably better in BP , and he carried it right into the game .
Tra@@ iling by three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning , the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game .
Center fielder B@@ y@@ ron Bu@@ xton led off the inning with a double down the left field line .
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a bunt single , and Simon got second baseman Brian Do@@ zi@@ er to strike out sw@@ inging before being lifted for left-@@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy walked M@@ a@@ u@@ er , the only man he faced , ahead of rookie designated hitter Miguel San@@ o , who ripped a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew V@@ e@@ r@@ Hagen .
With a pair of runners on and the tying run at second , V@@ e@@ r@@ Hagen got third baseman Trevor Pl@@ o@@ u@@ ffe to ground into a double play .
It was the m@@ a@@ j@@ or-@@ league-@@ leading 27@@ th time this season that Pl@@ o@@ u@@ ffe hit into a DP .
After Detroit t@@ acked on an insurance run in the top of the ninth , M@@ a@@ u@@ er ripped an RBI double to the gap against Tigers closer Bruce Ron@@ don to make it 5-@@ 4 .
However , the right-hander struck out San@@ o on three pitches for his fifth save .
Detroit took advantage of a r@@ u@@ sty Phil Hughes in the early going .
The Tigers posted three runs in the first two innings against the veteran right-hander , who came off the disa@@ b@@ l@@ ed list before the game after missing more than a month because of lower back inf@@ lam@@ mation .
" Obviously not the start I 'd like to have , " Hughes said , " but I felt more comfortable as I went along and felt I was able to exec@@ ute some pretty good pitches there in the third inning . "
After getting the lead@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ush@@ es gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
A two-@@ out walk to right fielder J.D. Martinez brought up Victor Martinez , who singled up the middle for the first run of the game .
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-for-@@ 21 streak with runners in scoring position .
Third baseman Nick C@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ os followed with a single to right , scoring another run , but Victor Martinez was thrown out trying to advance to third , ending the threat .
The Tigers added on in the second , getting a one-@@ out double from catcher James McCann and a two-@@ out single by center fielder Anthony G@@ ose to make it 3-@@ 0 .
" That was a big hit , " Twins manager Paul Mol@@ itor said .
He didn 't hit it particularly well , but he got it in the right spot .
Hughes , who was on a pitch count , pitched a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-@@ handed reliever A@@ .@@ J. A@@ c@@ h@@ ter .
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strike@@ outs .
NO@@ T@@ ES : Tigers R@@ HP A@@ n@@ ib@@ al Sanchez was shut down with a strain in his throwing shoulder .
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews , who performed surgery on Sanchez 's shoulder back in 2007 .
Sanchez , on the disa@@ b@@ l@@ ed list with a shoulder strain since mid-@@ August , was scheduled to be a@@ c@@ tiv@@ ated for a Wednesday start .
With Sanchez out , L@@ HP Daniel Norris will come off the D@@ L to start against the Twins .
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a trade for L@@ HP David Price on July 30 .
He has been out since Aug. 20 with a strained right obli@@ que .
The Tigers and Twins will wra@@ p up their three-@@ game series at Tar@@ get Field on Wednesday .
Norris ( 2-@@ 2 , 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will oppose Minnesota R@@ HP E@@ r@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5-@@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ER@@ A ) .
Hundreds of refugees to be given accommod@@ ation in Wies@@ b@@ a@@ den
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ e@@ s@@ se .
They are expected to arrive by Wednesday night .
The people who have travelled there will then be housed in emergency shelters in Wies@@ b@@ a@@ den , according to a statement made by the city of Wies@@ b@@ a@@ den on Tuesday evening .
They estimate that between 450 and 750 refugees will arrive .
A number of sports halls in the H@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ an capital have been prepared for this event@@ uality over the last few days .
Up to 1000 refugees can be provided with temporary accommod@@ ation in these .
After this they should be r@@ e@@ distributed to other communities .
According to a statement by the regional council of Gi@@ e@@ s@@ sen , responsible for their initial reception , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ e@@ s@@ se in the past ten days alone
Due to the large number of refugees , emergency shelter has also been set up in sports halls in Frankfurt and Han@@ au .
I@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Mun@@ ich Security Conference , Wolfgang I@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ inger , believes that military action in Syria with participation from Germany is a possibility .
" I believe that determined consideration about military courses of action should not take place without Germany , " he said .
He accused the European nations of " colle@@ ctively looking the other way . "
Four years ago one would have been happy for the chal@@ ice of military involvement to pass Germany by .
" Now the conflict has come cr@@ ashing down at our front door , " he said on the German World Service .
The former German Ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid loc@@ ally for the refugees .
Austria running checks on southern and eastern borders
According to Germany , Austria has once more introduced checks to its southern and eastern borders .
The Austrian Interior Minister , Johann@@ a Mi@@ k@@ l@@ -@@ L@@ e@@ i@@ t@@ ner , stated on the Austrian television channel OR@@ F on Tuesday evening that currently nobody is being sent back to Hung@@ ary .
Nor has Germany sent any refugees back to Austria .
" No , that is the agreement , " she confirmed .
On the question of an agreement about whether a specific number of refugees per day can be taken to go to Germany from Austria , Mi@@ k@@ l@@ -@@ L@@ e@@ i@@ t@@ ner said that discussions on this matter have already been held between the general director for public security and representatives of Germany .
She gave no specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday .
Over the last few days tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hung@@ ary over the so-called Bal@@ k@@ an route .
Most of them are heading to Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague , Werner Fay@@ mann , together with a number of other EU states and heads of government , are proposing a special summit for next week .
On Sunday Germany started to impose temporary border controls .
To date the EU states have not been able to agree to a common approach to the crisis .
At a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) the EU i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ior ministers want to make a new attempt at a mandatory r@@ e@@ distribution of a further 120@@ ,000 refugees .
In view of the heavy influ@@ x of refugees into Germany , the Federal government wants to provide more support to the states with initial reception and distribution of people .
The Federal government will manage this join@@ tly with the states , announced Merkel late on Tuesday evening after a discussion lasting almost four hours with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor 's office in Berlin .
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get it .
But those who have no prospects of permanent residency will not be able to stay in Germany .
This opinion is also clearly generally shared .
The Chancellor stressed that the country as a whole must now make a " huge effort . "
Thousands of desperate refugees are currently stuck on the Bal@@ k@@ an route .
On Monday night Hung@@ ary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia .
A few hours later the government in Budapest announced that it was also going to s@@ e@@ al off the border with Romania with a fence .
Unlike Serbia these n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ bouring countries belong to the EU .
Hung@@ ary wants to prevent people smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers finding alternative routes through Romania , said Hung@@ ary 's Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ jj@@ a@@ r@@ to about the planned new border fen@@ ces .
The Rom@@ anian government immediately condemned the plan .
The first arrests of people who had bre@@ ached the fence have taken place .
In Turkey meanwhile , according to eye@@ witness reports , thousands more mig@@ rants are heading for the Greek borders .
" Cass@@ ini " space probe finds ocean on Saturn 's moon E@@ n@@ cel@@ a@@ d@@ us
Under the icy cr@@ ust of Saturn 's moon E@@ n@@ cel@@ a@@ d@@ us s@@ p@@ lashes a global ocean .
Scienti@@ sts have d@@ e@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ ed this from observing the " Cass@@ ini " space probe
This is the reason the moon wob@@ bles slightly in its orbit of the ring@@ ed planet .
This wob@@ bling is only minor , but n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless too much for a solid cel@@ estial body , it was stated on Tuesday in a communication from Cor@@ nell University in I@@ t@@ h@@ ica in the US state of New York .
The scientists have published their findings in the " I@@ car@@ us " scientific journal .
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under E@@ n@@ cel@@ a@@ d@@ us 's cr@@ ust of ice .
" Cass@@ ini " had already discovered ice vol@@ can@@ oes , which spe@@ w water vap@@ our and ice parti@@ cles that feed the so-called E ring of Saturn , at the south p@@ o@@ l@@ e of this moon in 2006 .
Ast@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ m@@ ers concluded at the time that there had to be a sub@@ surface sea at least at the south p@@ o@@ l@@ e .
The extent of the hidden ocean was however not clear .
R@@ ama absent from 18@@ 60 Mun@@ ich for several weeks
18@@ 60 Mun@@ ich must do without attacking midfielder Val@@ d@@ e@@ t R@@ ama for about a month .
An examination revealed that the 27@@ -year-old has suffered an a@@ d@@ d@@ u@@ c@@ tor injury , the club revealed .
R@@ ama had complained of pain at the beginning of the week .
According to the Mun@@ ich Lions , the diagno@@ sis means " probably a four week compul@@ sory break . "
" It 's hit us hard . R@@ ama is a bitter loss . "
" We have to think about it of course , " Sports Director N@@ e@@ c@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ü@@ n told the " B@@ i@@ l@@ d " newspaper , regarding the possible engagement of a professional who is not attached to a club .
However the next training guest the sex@@ a@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ arian is due to present is a defen@@ der .
Thir@@ ty-@@ year-old H@@ r@@ v@@ o@@ j@@ e C@@ ale last played in Belgium and was formerly under contract to V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ f@@ sburg .
At the moment the Croatian has " the opportunity to prove himself . "
Following his conc@@ ussion , goal s@@ c@@ o@@ r@@ er Rub@@ in O@@ k@@ o@@ tie is returning to training with the team in the coming week .
The Austrian international should be getting back to training runs on Thursday .
O@@ k@@ o@@ tie sustained a head injury in a violent collision in the match with Fort@@ u@@ n@@ a D@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
C@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ ary to initial fears , however , the wound was not serious .
Not a diet fruit - m@@ a@@ n@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
Man@@ goes are exo@@ tic , ju@@ icy and sweet .
But anybody watching their wa@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ line should avoid them .
Because m@@ a@@ n@@ goes have a relatively high sugar content - primarily s@@ u@@ c@@ rose .
The exo@@ tic fruit is n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless healthy : they contain B vit@@ amins as well as vit@@ amins E and C. But most of all m@@ a@@ n@@ goes are full of vit@@ amin A and its precur@@ sor , b@@ e@@ ta-@@ c@@ aro@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ e .
Eating the fruit boo@@ sts the sight , imm@@ une system and the body 's met@@ abo@@ lic processes .
When buying m@@ a@@ n@@ goes they should not be too soft or too firm and they should have a pleas@@ ant aroma .
It is not possible to tell from the colour of the skin how r@@ i@@ pe the fruit is - even green m@@ a@@ n@@ goes can taste del@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ous .
They should be kept at room temperature and consum@@ ed within a few days .
They are del@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ous on their own or in sweet dish@@ es .
A m@@ a@@ n@@ go also gives a special touch even to s@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ ury dish@@ es .
They m@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ g@@ ate the slightly bitter taste of some leaf sal@@ ads such as chic@@ ory and r@@ a@@ dic@@ c@@ h@@ io .
And a m@@ a@@ n@@ go c@@ h@@ u@@ t@@ ney goes well with fish , p@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ try , lam@@ b and game .

First a f@@ o@@ e@@ h@@ n storm , then a pronounced cold front
The f@@ o@@ e@@ h@@ n will break through in the v@@ alle@@ ys on the nor@@ then side of the A@@ l@@ ps in the coming night , M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ o@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ w@@ e@@ i@@ z announced on Tuesday .
The f@@ o@@ e@@ h@@ n will blow through the Fo@@ e@@ h@@ n V@@ alle@@ ys on Wednesday , continuing through the night , sometimes at gale force .
Once the f@@ o@@ e@@ h@@ n has died away on Thursday morning a prominent cold front will cut across our region , bringing heavy rainf@@ all , g@@ u@@ sty winds and a drop in temperature .
According to M@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ o@@ News , Switz@@ erland is currently facing an extensive area of low pressure being brought from the British Is@@ les in a strong southwestern flow .
The f@@ o@@ e@@ h@@ n will break through the v@@ alle@@ ys on the northern sides of the A@@ l@@ ps during Tuesday night .
The f@@ o@@ e@@ h@@ n will then blow through the Fo@@ e@@ h@@ n V@@ alle@@ ys until Thursday morning with g@@ u@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h ; occasionally , and particularly in the can@@ ton of Ur@@ i , increasing at times to over 100 km / h .
In places the f@@ o@@ e@@ h@@ n may advance into the adjacent mid@@ land , and on the mountains gale force winds of over 120 km / h are even possible .
While in the north stor@@ my f@@ o@@ e@@ h@@ ns on Wednesday will bring sum@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , m@@ o@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ure will begin to build up on the southern slo@@ pes of the A@@ l@@ ps .
Here it will start to rain and this will continue until Thursday evening .
Over the next 48 hours the south of the A@@ l@@ ps can expect over 100 lit@@ res of rain per square met@@ re in places , following on from a large volume of rain which has fallen over the last few days .
On Thursday morning the f@@ o@@ e@@ h@@ n will die down , resulting in a cold front with heavy , sometimes t@@ h@@ under@@ y rain rolling from west to east over Switz@@ erland .
In conjun@@ ction with the cold front , the wind will get stronger increasing to stor@@ my , and temperatures will decrease sharply .
The following days will be autum@@ n@@ al in the north with temperatures of 15 to 20 degrees , wher@@ e@@ as in the south it will be sun@@ n@@ ier and warmer at the weekend with temperatures up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Some 500 years after the R@@ e@@ formation , Rome now has a Martin Luther Square .
In the presence of the Mayor of the City , I@@ g@@ n@@ a@@ zi@@ o Marino , a hi@@ ther@@ to u@@ n@@ named square in the park on the O@@ p@@ p@@ io Hill was on Wednesday best@@ owed with the name of the German reformer .
On the " Pi@@ azza Martin L@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ o " he is now recogn@@ ised as the " German the@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ an of the R@@ e@@ formation . "
The park is in the centre of Rome right next to the C@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ um
The consortium of E@@ van@@ g@@ e@@ l@@ ical churches in Rome proposed the choice of name .
J@@ ens@@ -@@ Martin Kr@@ use , minister of the E@@ van@@ g@@ e@@ l@@ ical Lu@@ ther@@ an community in Rome , recalled on Wednesday that for centuries Protest@@ ants in the Pop@@ e 's city often had to hide their faith .
The square is a visual symbol that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
As a young A@@ u@@ g@@ u@@ stin@@ ian m@@ o@@ n@@ k , Martin Luther ( 14@@ 8@@ 3-@@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome for a few months at the turn of the year between 15@@ 10 and 15@@ 11 .
At the time he considered the city to be a d@@ e@@ generate hot@@ bed of vice .
According to historians , his negative impres@@ sions may have been reinforced in his later fight against Rome .
Luther h@@ e@@ r@@ alded the beginning of the Western Church with his t@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ es against the selling of ind@@ u@@ l@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ ces .
Tal@@ ented artist invest@@ s three years in his personal interpretation of the Bi@@ ble .
J@@ e@@ s@@ us with the ( g@@ i@@ l@@ ded ) crown of thor@@ ns is one of the major works that O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t has painted for his Bi@@ ble .
Kl@@ aus A@@ l@@ t@@ e@@ post has written an introduction and updated the text of the Bi@@ ble .
In the beginning was the word ?
No , not in the O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t Bi@@ ble , which has now been issued with magn@@ ific@@ ent pictures .
For O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t , who has d@@ e@@ vised his own personal interpretation of bib@@ lical stories in 150 m@@ o@@ t@@ i@@ f@@ s on paper and canvas , in the beginning was the picture .
The 75@@ -year-old conceived his " language " with bright colo@@ urs and imaginative forms - which are however by no means s@@ y@@ non@@ y@@ m@@ ous with " funny " pictures .
On the contr@@ ary : depending on the respective themes , they can appear to be thor@@ o@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ly glo@@ omy .
O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t worked on his Bi@@ ble project for around three years and for this project he made a sub@@ jec@@ tive choice from an artistic perspective from the many subject areas in the " Book of books . "
Cy@@ cles evolved , dedicated to top@@ ics such as the Way of the Cross , p@@ l@@ a@@ g@@ u@@ es , the C@@ o@@ m@@ mand@@ ments or the Lord 's Pra@@ yer .
Without even approaching them , he immediately a@@ t@@ t@@ acted multiple partners : this applies to the Luther V@@ e@@ r@@ l@@ a@@ g , a publisher speci@@ a@@ l@@ ising in theological works as well as the K@@ ett@@ ler V@@ e@@ r@@ l@@ a@@ g , who focus on publishing art books .
And in particular author Kl@@ aus A@@ l@@ t@@ e@@ post , who has grap@@ pled with the particular Bi@@ ble passages based on the paintings .
He has interpre@@ ted the Bi@@ ble tex@@ ts selected by O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t and " trans@@ lated " them to the current day , in a top@@ ical context .
These tex@@ ts are like verbal mirrors of A@@ l@@ t 's paintings .
They are embedded between the original Bi@@ ble q@@ u@@ ot@@ ations of Martin Luther and each composition by the artist , who has here f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ ated his own personal concep@@ ts for the respective situations .
The decorated cover of the book is let@@ tered in gold .
The 75@@ -year-old allows at the same time a t@@ w@@ o@@ f@@ old insight , deep into both his sou@@ l and his emo@@ tions .
This is particularly intim@@ ate .
Ultimately , his emo@@ tions were the key t@@ r@@ i@@ gger for the Bi@@ ble project : O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t , who was born in W@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ i@@ g@@ ero@@ de in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ ut order .
" Education there took place under the sha@@ dow of the can@@ e , " remembers O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t .
" I have tried to process this , so that perhaps I can come to terms with the Lord again .
His second point is that he wants to help art once more to take a more significant place in this fast moving age : " The perception of the visual world today is shaped by advertising , which is loud .
Symb@@ o@@ l@@ ism has been driven out .
Arti@@ sts have a different passion and joy in presenting things .
Pictures always have something mysteri@@ ous about them ; they are not decor@@ ation .
" In this respect , I am a din@@ o@@ sau@@ r . "
O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t wants his viewers to let themselves " fall into " the pictures , to let them leave their impression , to discover and experience the power they have : " The picture is looking for its counterpart . "
At the launch of the O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t Bi@@ ble on Tuesday , Kl@@ aus A@@ l@@ t@@ e@@ post confessed to having " always " been a lover of O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t 's art : " I like the way he sees life with his pictures . "
A@@ l@@ t was not interested in recording the whole of the Bi@@ ble , s@@ e@@ l@@ ecting only the the themes which were for him the most significant and also the most mysteri@@ ous .
" This wasn 't a collaboration between partners , " says A@@ l@@ t@@ e@@ post , " it was about the pictures ; the text is merely an explanation . " The result is a picture Bi@@ ble .
For Hans M@@ ö@@ h@@ ler of the Luther V@@ e@@ r@@ l@@ a@@ g this work is an invitation " to add depth to his life and to find freedom . "
O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t 's pictures speak , for M@@ ö@@ h@@ ler , the ( bib@@ lical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
Some of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas - will be shown for the first time in an exhibition which opens on 15th November in the O@@ t@@ m@@ ar A@@ l@@ t Foundation .
Start of construction draws closer for BM@@ X track
Plans made , site found , company c@@ o@@ m@@ mission@@ ed , mound for a circuit m@@ o@@ d@@ elled : one year later , everything was nearly finished - but even before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was closed again .
Political and administrative fail@@ ings caused anger , particularly with residents who did not want to put up with the track .
So the mound was demolished and the search began for a new site - now with a formal application for planning permission .
Ap@@ proval will be received in October , chief local c@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ or Sab@@ ine M@@ o@@ s@@ e@@ bach@@ -@@ B@@ o@@ ch has now been able to inform the children 's and young people 's committee .
" I hope that this year something will be seen to happen , " she said .
The work should then be started without any " further p@@ ause for thought " at the site of the former indoor swimming pool .
D@@ F@@ B steps up its commitment to refugees
The German football league gave clear indic@@ ations at the weekend that the D@@ F@@ B is exten@@ ding its commitment to refugees to 20@@ 19 .
Football has reacted to the deterior@@ ating situation in Germany and promised politicians its help with the current problems .
" I consider this to be the biggest challenge in our country since r@@ e@@ u@@ n@@ ification . "
" B@@ asi@@ cally nobody knows , it 's no concern of mine , it 's not my doing . "
" It is in the interests of everybody to get to grip with this issue , " says D@@ F@@ B chief Wolfgang N@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ b@@ ach .
He wants to debate the subject of the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ s@@ i@@ vely at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin .
I 'm going to be in the Chancellor 's office next Wednesday and I 'm meeting there with State Minister Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . "
" I 'm sure the topic will play a central role there , " he announces .
Football can and will help .
But the politicians must set the deci@@ ding guidelines .
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative " 1 : 0 for a welcome " to four years .
" Through the E@@ g@@ i@@ d@@ i@@ us-@@ Braun foundation we have ensu@@ red that this program will continue until 20@@ 19 , " declared N@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ b@@ ach on the b@@ r@@ ink of the U@@ E@@ FA meeting in St Juli@@ an 's , Malta
Several teams are also supporting the programme .
This very weekend the 36 professional clubs will be sending out a clear message when they wear the words " We are helping - # refu@@ g@@ e@@ e@@ s@@ welcome " on the left sleeve of their strip instead of the usual sponsor 's logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
" We are doing this to make it clear that everyone should help where and in any way they can , " L@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ k@@ u@@ s@@ en 's sport boss Rud@@ i V@@ ö@@ l@@ ler told the " B@@ i@@ l@@ d " newspaper on Tuesday , and describes the scheme as " a matter of course . "
" The refugee drama concerns everyone , nobody can look away . "
" We football teams can , no , we must use our charis@@ ma , our influence , and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered tremend@@ ously , " says Her@@ tha manager Michael P@@ r@@ e@@ e@@ t@@ z .
H@@ offen@@ heim 's Managing Director Peter R@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ i@@ g spoke of a prominent signal by the league .
The women 's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle ( Sa@@ ale ) for the World Cup qualifying match against Hung@@ ary .
N@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ b@@ ach describes supporting the refugees as " a grand joint effort by German football . "
It is amazing that all 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their own locations .
It is just as amazing that both small and large clubs are doing this .
The message " 1 : 0 for a welcome , " that we have sent out is being lived in football .
" That is of enormous significance , " he said .
In both this year and next year the association together with the D@@ F@@ B team and the Federal government are making € 300,000 available for the integration of refugees .
" The clubs have already already released the entire sum for 20@@ 15 , " reports N@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ b@@ ach .
Reports : SAP chief executive loses an eye in accident
According to several reports , the chief executive of Europe 's largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ m@@ o@@ tt , lost his left eye through a fall at the beginning of July .
In an accident on the stairs in his brother 's house in the USA after midnight , he fell on a water glass he was carrying in his left hand , reported the " Wir@@ t@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ wo@@ che " on Wednesday .
" He almost b@@ l@@ ed to death , he was unconscious , then he dragged himself out onto the road - so he told us last week , " the " Wi@@ W@@ o " quoted SAP co-@@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ m@@ o@@ tt will however be able to return to work .
" We are meeting up at the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf at the beginning of October , " said Pl@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ ner .
The 54@@ -year-old manager will be at the meeting and " fully fit for work . "
Mc@@ Der@@ m@@ o@@ tt announced in an interview with the " S@@ ü@@ d@@ d@@ e@@ u@@ t@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ en Z@@ e@@ i@@ t@@ ung " ( Thursday 's edition ) that he will come back to Germany in October and take over the lead at the software group again .
" I am definitely there for SAP , completely involved in my job . "
" I have of course been in regular contact with the board and its chairman , Has@@ so Pl@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ ner , the whole time , " Mc@@ Der@@ m@@ o@@ tt told the " S@@ Z . "
Mc@@ Der@@ m@@ o@@ tt normally comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he has no longer been in the SAP German headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
I@@ i is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager told the " S@@ Z " : " It could happen to anyone . "
" The important thing is to get up again if you fall down . "
McLaren reserve driver Magn@@ u@@ s@@ sen out of action ...
Magn@@ u@@ s@@ sen t@@ w@@ i@@ t@@ tered a photo of the damage and explained that he received the injury falling from a bike .
This means that his chances of being reserve driver to the two main drivers , Fernando Alonso and J@@ e@@ n@@ son Button , for the night race in Singapore at the weekend are as sli@@ m as those for the Grand Pri@@ x in Japan a week later .
Football : B@@ V@@ B v Kr@@ a@@ s@@ n@@ o@@ dar without R@@ e@@ us : W@@ e@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ f@@ eller in goal
All hopes have been crushed for Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dor@@ t@@ m@@ und that Marco R@@ e@@ us might make a comeback in the first group match of the European league .
The international player will also be missing from the German B@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ lig@@ a leader 's match in its dual with F@@ K Kr@@ a@@ s@@ n@@ o@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. on Sky ) .
" Unfortunately he isn 't in the running , " said Thomas Tu@@ c@@ h@@ el on Wednesday .
The B@@ V@@ B coach is leaving it open as to whether R@@ e@@ us will be there on Sunday in the B@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ lig@@ a top match against L@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ k@@ u@@ s@@ en : " We are expecting him to return to training on Friday . "
In light of the heavy burden on his professionals , Tu@@ c@@ h@@ el does not want to change his first choice 11 just because of R@@ e@@ us 's position .
So he has announced a change of g@@ o@@ a@@ l@@ keeper .
Thus Roman W@@ e@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of regular keeper Roman B@@ ü@@ r@@ ki .
" He 's training at absolute top level , " praised the world champion 's football coach .
Tu@@ c@@ h@@ el is leaving it open as to whether W@@ e@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ fel@@ der will be used in all European league matches in the future .
It is highly likely that he will also play the second game .
Mid@@ fielder Juli@@ an W@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ l considers team mate R@@ e@@ us 's b@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ k statement that the final of the European league must be B@@ V@@ B 's objective quite under@@ stand@@ able : " Marco isn 't so far off the mark with that . "
" I think we 've got a good chance of pic@@ king up the title . "
R@@ o@@ b@@ o@@ t cars : Government wants Germany to take a leading role
The Federal Government wants Germany to be techn@@ ological leaders in changes to cars .
On Wednesday the German cabinet resolved on a policy document introduced by the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ b@@ r@@ ind@@ t ( CSU ) which provides , among other things , for investment in development of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ b@@ r@@ ind@@ t spoke in Frankfurt on Wednesday , on the b@@ r@@ ink of the IA@@ A motor show , about a " new era of mobility . "
A@@ u@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ ated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer traffic jams , said Do@@ b@@ r@@ ind@@ t .
He wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G@@ 7 countries , who are also meeting with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
The Transport Ministry policy document stressed among other things the importance of the development of mobile broadband and a rapid switch to digital radio .
There is currently a test area on the A9 motorway to try out the new technology .
In order that " no extra liability risk will be imposed " on drivers , the government wants to " examine and , where necessary , adap@@ t " legal parameters to the new developments .
Germany wants to agree on international provisions for the speed limit for dri@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ less cars to be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
The German government also wants to reach an agreement on changes to the Vienn@@ a Convention , which to date only provides for human beings as drivers .
With automatic driving the car increasingly takes control and the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
The technology is primarily based on sens@@ ors and cameras which capture the environment and process data in seconds .
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of the Environment , highly autom@@ ated driving will be techn@@ ically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
However dri@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ less vehicles " are not anticipated until 2020 " on public roads .
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly autom@@ ated driving fun@@ ctions in Germany will be around € 8.@@ 4 billion for 20@@ 25 .
" Digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , " says S@@ P@@ D transport politician S@@ ö@@ r@@ en Bar@@ t@@ o@@ l .
However the issue of liability for accidents and the security of drivers ' personal data must be conclu@@ sively clar@@ ified .
And Germans still view dri@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ less cars s@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tically - much more than the French or Americans .
A survey by the F@@ o@@ r@@ sa Institute c@@ o@@ m@@ mission@@ ed by the testing organisation D@@ e@@ k@@ ra , presented to the IA@@ A on Wednesday , conclu@@ des that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driven vehicles will catch on in the coming 10 years , 32 percent estimate it will take 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it will happen at all .
In France 21 percent of those asked expect to see autonom@@ ously driven cars by 20@@ 25 and in the USA 33 percent .
Any@@ way drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a completely self driven car .
According to a survey by the digital association B@@ i@@ t@@ k@@ o@@ m , only seven percent agree that control should be handed over to the car during the entire journey on all roads .
Nevertheless , 15 percent could imagine this happening on motor@@ ways in free-@@ flowing traffic and 45 percent in traffic jams .
Approximately one in four would never give control to the car under any circumstances .
B@@ oll not to play in team and doubles in European Championship
As things stand , the D@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ dorf player plans to play only in the singles in the competition , running from 25 September to 4 October .
The final decision will be made on 22 September .
" It is a major loss for our team . "
" The lads heard about it this morning . "
" But we are strong enough to pick up the title without Tim@@ o , " said national coach J@@ ö@@ r@@ g Ros@@ s@@ k@@ o@@ p@@ f during European Championship training in D@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ dorf .
At this time B@@ oll was on a flight to a long arranged appointment with sponsors in China .
The 34@@ -year-old German champion is expected back on Friday .
" Without Tim@@ o we have the disa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ age of no longer being the clear favour@@ ites , " declared individual European champion Dim@@ i@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ j O@@ v@@ char@@ ov .
But the Ham@@ elin player , who is the top seed in E@@ k@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ b@@ u@@ r@@ g , also remembers the European Championship in S@@ c@@ h@@ w@@ e@@ c@@ h@@ at in 20@@ 13 .
" We didn 't have Tim@@ o then either , and we still became European Champions . "
" That is what we need to focus on , " declared the world number five .
The English football national player Luke Shaw , of Manchester , United has sustained a severe injury to his right leg .
In the course of the tackle in the Champions League game with P@@ S@@ V E@@ i@@ n@@ d@@ h@@ o@@ ven , the defen@@ der was hit by H@@ é@@ ctor Moreno and after a long bout of treatment was replaced .
Initial diagno@@ sis indic@@ ates that the 20@@ -year-old who used to play with B@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ ian Schw@@ e@@ i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ i@@ ger has broken his t@@ i@@ bia .
Gaul@@ tier feels too old to be an e@@ n@@ f@@ ant terrible
It is a mixture of a huge fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ works chamber of hor@@ r@@ ors : designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition of his work in Mun@@ ich on Wednesday .
The highlights : m@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ q@@ u@@ ins which look a@@ l@@ arm@@ ingly human thanks to video proj@@ ection .
They wear the French designer 's spectac@@ ular c@@ r@@ e@@ ations , which among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna 's stage outfits - and also put men in s@@ k@@ i@@ r@@ ts .
" These days I can 't say I 'm the e@@ n@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te c@@ out@@ ure any longer , because I have white hair . "
" It used to be ble@@ ached , n@@ o@@ w@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s it 's real , " says Gaul@@ tier .
For visitors to the exhibition , " From the Side@@ walk to the Cat@@ walk , " which can be seen in the K@@ u@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ le at the H@@ yp@@ o Cul@@ ture Foundation from 1 September , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluctant attitude to a show about his own character .
Origin@@ ally he was against it because , " For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , " he said .
When you die , you get put into a museum .
This remark@@ able collection has already been staged in Montreal , Canada , and in Paris .
It 's about a lot more than beautiful clothes , " says the director of the K@@ u@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ le , Roger D@@ i@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ en .
It is about toler@@ ance , accep@@ tance and the vision of an open society .
The exhib@@ its provide an insight into the hard to over@@ look work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having finished his education .
The show is not construc@@ ted c@@ h@@ ron@@ ologically , but it is a brilli@@ antly choreographed complete work of art which has involved a great deal of effort : for example a sty@@ list has been engaged especially to look after the m@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ q@@ u@@ ins ' hair .
According to curator T@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ r@@ y-@@ Ma@@ x@@ i@@ m@@ e Lor@@ iot , the creators car@@ ted 14 tonnes of material to Mun@@ ich .
Shor@@ tly before the start of Ok@@ tober@@ fest there was also a special treat in store : a L@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ h@@ o@@ sen outfit with a cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna
He has always been interested in strong women ( " Women are cle@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ er than men " ) and in people who are a little different , says Gaul@@ tier .
Even Gaul@@ tier 's old teddy is on show in the exhibition .
He represents the designer 's first , tentative steps at fashion .
As a child ( he was not a good pup@@ il and he was bad at football ) , he dressed his teddy in b@@ r@@ as and dresses .
His parents did not allow him to play with dolls .
Later he taught himself fashion design .
He stole fashion magazines and scrut@@ i@@ n@@ ised other desig@@ ners ' c@@ r@@ e@@ ations , Gaul@@ tier told us in Mun@@ ich .
Of course , later I bought them .
He was not able to pay the models for his first fashion show .
They got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
Dec@@ o@@ r@@ ation instead of c@@ u@@ r@@ t@@ a@@ ins - P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace as a fashion n@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ e
There used to be long e@@ m@@ bro@@ ider@@ y machines in and around P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en making many metres
of e@@ m@@ bro@@ i@@ dered f@@ abri@@ cs and l@@ aces in vast quantities for customers who made , for example , table clo@@ ths and c@@ u@@ r@@ t@@ a@@ ins .
This is no longer the case today , explains Andreas Rein@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ t , managing director of M@@ o@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ t@@ z@@ e P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en .
Instead , fashion is once more important .
In the early days of P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace , fashion played a large role , then it was replaced by the home text@@ ile industry - and now it is being r@@ e@@ discovered as a n@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ e .
Rein@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ t gave a few examples : l@@ ace in decor@@ ation , for accessories such as bags and for traditional costumes .
G@@ ener@@ ally , so-called vin@@ tage fashion , based on style e@@ r@@ as from the past , is producing an increasing potential for orders .
Anyone in the text@@ ile industry in Germany who cannot serve a n@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ e is no longer in the market .
We are already getting half of all our contracts this way .
M@@ o@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ i@@ t@@ z@@ e P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en , together with nine other businesses , is a member of the P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ ener S@@ p@@ i@@ t@@ z@@ e und Stick@@ e@@ r@@ e@@ i@@ en trade association .
Only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
Sales have fallen by around 80 percent over the last 15 years .
There are now hardly any private speci@@ ality shops or w@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ a@@ l@@ ers .
Our products hardly reach the customers over these channels .
Now@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ s mass produced goods are manufactured much more cheaply in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
Fur@@ ther@@ more exports to Russia and the USA are currently weakening slightly .
This is enough reason for new directions .
The trade association is also trying to score with environmental c@@ o@@ n@@ sci@@ o@@ u@@ s@@ ness , as C@@ o@@ r@@ d@@ e@@ l@@ ia Bauer of Stick@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein explains . " As of this year we have implemented a s@@ e@@ al of quality which shows that our production is e@@ c@@ ologically and socially compatible .
Rein@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ t added , " This also applies to the materials we use . "
Q@@ u@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ fied designer U@@ te S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t teaches in the faculty for applied arts at the S@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ e@@ e@@ berg branch of the West Sa@@ x@@ ony University of Z@@ w@@ ick@@ au and speci@@ a@@ l@@ ises in e@@ m@@ bro@@ ider@@ y and l@@ ace .
In order to face the competition from the Asian regions one has to find high-quality and innovative products .
That takes time and courage .
There is a field of tension between the desig@@ ners ' new@@ est ideas and businesses , who must think primarily in commercial terms , " says S@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t .
This is why existing designs are often only slightly varied in order to keep core customers .
A few years ago text@@ ile designer Kat@@ i R@@ e@@ u@@ t@@ er rev@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ ised the historic snow@@ ball l@@ ace .
The machines e@@ m@@ bro@@ i@@ der small beads in selected places .
P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en master gol@@ d@@ sm@@ ith Bi@@ anca H@@ alle@@ bach@@ -K@@ rau@@ ß@@ e was inspired by this . " In the past I had no use for traditional P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace . "
Now she uses the snow@@ ball l@@ ace for her je@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ery .
Using an elaborate process she e@@ m@@ bosses the pattern in silver .
" Many people in the region identify themselves with P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace - young and old , " says R@@ e@@ u@@ t@@ er .
She also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - primarily to customers whose f@@ o@@ ref@@ ath@@ ers lived in P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en and the surrounding area and who want to have a mem@@ e@@ n@@ to .
So with my je@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ery I see myself as a modern ambassador for P@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ en l@@ ace .
Disney plans new " Mary P@@ opp@@ ins " film
You shouldn 't interfere with legen@@ ds , but Disney is daring to make a new film of the classic " Mary P@@ opp@@ ins " anyway .
But according to " Entertainment Week@@ ly " it is not going to be a r@@ e@@ make but a sort of sequel , set 20 years after the first film with the mag@@ ical n@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ y .
It is about the n@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ y 's experiences with the Banks family in the time of the Great Depression in England .
Who is going to take the role of Mary P@@ opp@@ ins , played 50 years ago by Julie Andrews , is not yet certain .
But the director has been decided : Rob Marshall , whose most recent film was " Into the Woods . "
Xi urges to open economy wider to world
The economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth , President Xi J@@ i@@ n@@ ping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday .
" China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and expertise , and improve o@@ p@@ e@@ n@@ ing-@@ up policies , " he said , addressing the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deep@@ ening Overall Reform .
Promo@@ ting opening up while pushing forward reforms will add new imp@@ e@@ t@@ us and vit@@ ality , and provide new room for economic growth , Xi said .
The leading group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list regul@@ ating market access , rela@@ x@@ ation of bor@@ der-@@ control policies , encouraging state-@@ owned enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to absor@@ b private capital and over@@ hau@@ ling the resident regist@@ ration system .
According to the statement , a negative list , identi@@ fying sectors and businesses that are off-@@ limits for investment , will be drawn up .
The system will be gradually tested and improved through trial programs .
The move is significant as it will give the market a bigger role in a@@ l@@ locating resources , ensuring a law@@ -based business environment and making the market more open , the statement said .
The government will also loo@@ sen controls on the powers it delegates to companies , making sure that companies decide how to run their businesses .
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-@@ border economic cooperation and new mechan@@ isms for promoting regional growth .
In a bid to open up state-@@ controlled sectors , more areas will be open to private investment .
" The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment , and will protect the law@@ ful interests of foreig@@ n-@@ funded companies and provide better services for them , " said the statement .
In addition , it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permits , or " green card , " by optim@@ izing requirements and stream@@ lining the application process .
Guar@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ e@@ ing lawyers ' right to practice and nur@@ turing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting .
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Ke@@ qiang , and senior leaders Liu Y@@ u@@ n@@ s@@ h@@ an and Z@@ hang G@@ a@@ o@@ l@@ i , according to a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double the m@@ e@@ r@@ cury limit in predatory fish
The EU commission wants to double the limits for m@@ e@@ r@@ cury in large predatory fish and consumers therefore can expect a significantly higher dose of this neu@@ r@@ o@@ tox@@ in .
The consumer organisation Foo@@ d@@ watch , to which an EU working paper on the subject was made available , is heavily critical of the plans . " Ris@@ ks and side effects of inappropriate industry and environmental politics will be passed on with full force to pregnant women and small children , " declared Mat@@ thi@@ as Wol@@ f@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t of Foo@@ d@@ watch .
According to Wol@@ f@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t , the limits for the neu@@ r@@ o@@ tox@@ in for large fish at the end of the food chain such as for example shar@@ k or s@@ w@@ o@@ r@@ d@@ fish are going to be raised from 1 to 2 mg of m@@ e@@ r@@ cury per k@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ gram of fish for " economic reasons . "
Large predatory fish however are today so heavily contaminated with m@@ e@@ r@@ cury that based on the still current limits some 50 percent of catches may not be sold .
Once the limit has been doubled , however , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be u@@ n@@ s@@ ale@@ able .
In return for this rela@@ x@@ ation the EU , according to Foo@@ d@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 mg to 0.1 mg of m@@ e@@ r@@ cury per k@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ gram .
But Foo@@ d@@ watch describes this as a " trick , " because smaller prey fish , such as for example car@@ p , generally have so little cont@@ a@@ m@@ ination that these planned maximum levels are already complied with today .
The reduction for small fish therefore is " a p@@ e@@ r@@ f@@ i@@ dious diver@@ sion@@ ary tac@@ tic which helps only the economy , " declares Wol@@ f@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ mid@@ t .
Mer@@ cury is for human beings a highly toxic heavy metal which accumul@@ ates largely in the food chain , above all in predatory fish .
For this reason the German government has issued a warning that " even low levels , particularly in u@@ n@@ born children , can lead to damage to the nervous system . "
The German Environment Minister , however , declared on his home page with regard to the current maximum levels that a " health risk to the general population " is not anticipated .
Mer@@ cury is released into the environment primarily through the burning of coal .
German coal plants , according to written information from the German Ministry of the Environment to Green Bun@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ g member Ann@@ a@@ l@@ ena Ba@@ e@@ r@@ b@@ o@@ ck , dischar@@ ge more than six tonnes of m@@ e@@ r@@ cury per year , two thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
The concentr@@ ation of m@@ e@@ r@@ cury in fish , for example in the El@@ be , Rh@@ ine and Dan@@ u@@ be , is " extensively exce@@ eded on a long-term basis , " the " Spiegel " newspaper quoted from the paper in March .
In the past year , Euro@@ p@@ e@@ -@@ wide a@@ l@@ erts on m@@ e@@ r@@ cury in fish rated among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ F@@ F .
