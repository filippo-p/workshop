Obama receives N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u
The rel@@ ation@@ ship between Obama and N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u is not exactly fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly .
The two wanted to talk about the im@@ p@@ le@@ m@@ ent@@ ation of the international agreement and about T@@ e@@ h@@ er@@ an 's de@@ st@@ ab@@ il@@ i@@ s@@ ing activities in the M@@ id@@ d@@ le East .
The meeting was also planned to cover the con@@ fli@@ c@@ t with the Pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ ans and the disp@@ ut@@ ed two state solution .
Rel@@ ations between Obama and N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u have been stra@@ in@@ ed for years .
Washington c@@ r@@ it@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ es the con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ou@@ s building of se@@ tt@@ le@@ ments in Israel and ac@@ c@@ us@@ es N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u of a lack of in@@ it@@ i@@ ative in the peace process .
The rel@@ ation@@ ship between the two has further deteriorated because of the deal that Obama ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ated on Iran 's atomic programme , .
In March , at the in@@ v@@ itation of the Republicans , N@@ e@@ t@@ an@@ y@@ ah@@ u made a controversial speech to the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ r@@ on@@ t to Obama .
The speech had not been agreed with Obama , who had re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted a meeting with reference to the election that was at that time im@@ p@@ en@@ ding in Israel .
