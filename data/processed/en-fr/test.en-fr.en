Spect@@ a@@ c@@ ular W@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ suit Jump Over Bogota
S@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ sman J@@ hon@@ athan Flo@@ rez jumped from a helicopter above Bogota , the capital of Colombia , on Thursday .
W@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ ing a wing@@ suit , he flew past over the famous M@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ rate San@@ ctu@@ ary at 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ km / h . The sanctu@@ ary is located at an altitude of over 3@@ 000 meters and numerous spectators had gathered there to watch his exploit .
A black box in your car ?
As America 's road plann@@ ers struggle to find the cash to m@@ end a crum@@ bling highway system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits n@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ ly by the d@@ a@@ s@@ h@@ board of your car .
The devices , which track every mile a motor@@ ist drives and transmit that information to bure@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ r@@ ats , are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America 's major roads .
The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ances .
Liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
The tea party is aghast .
The American Civil Liber@@ ties Union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
And while Congress can 't agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
They are expl@@ oring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over .
Thousands of motor@@ ists have already taken the black boxes , some of which have GPS monitoring , for a test drive .
This really is a must for our nation .
" It is not a matter of something we might choose to do , " said Has@@ an I@@ k@@ h@@ r@@ a@@ t@@ a , executive director of the Southern California Ass@@ n@@ . of Governments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motor@@ ist by 2@@ 0@@ 25 .
There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do it .
The push comes as the country 's Highway Trust Fund , financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump , is broke .
Americans don 't buy as much gas as they used to .
Cars get many more miles to the gallon .
The federal tax itself , 18.@@ 4 cents per gallon , hasn 't gone up in 20 years .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans are l@@ o@@ ath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high .
" The gas tax is just not sustain@@ able , " said Lee Mun@@ n@@ ich , a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota .
His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a p@@ a@@ y@@ -by-@@ mile system .
" This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , " he said .
Won@@ ks call it a mil@@ e@@ a@@ g@@ e@@ -@@ based user fee .
It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liber@@ als , as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases , for example .
California plann@@ ers are looking to the system as they d@@ e@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ e strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state 's ambitious global warming laws .
But Rep. Bill Shu@@ ster ( R-@@ Pa . ) , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .
The free market@@ eers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile .
" This is not just a tax going into a black hole , " said Adrian Moore , vice president of policy at Reason .
People are paying more directly into what they are getting .
The movement is also bol@@ stered by two former U.S. Transportation secre@@ tar@@ ies , who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-@@ mile direction .
The U.S. Senate approved a $ 9@@ 0@@ -@@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars .
But the House leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constitu@@ ents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
The most eager is Oregon , which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country 's biggest exper@@ iment .
Those drivers will soon pay the mil@@ e@@ age fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
Nevada has already completed a pilot .
New York City is looking into one .
Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 Coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern S@@ e@@ aboard ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is studying how they could go about implementing the change .
The concept is not a universal hit .
In Nevada , where about 50 volunteers ' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
" Concer@@ ns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem , " said A@@ l@@ a@@ u@@ d@@ d@@ in Khan , who d@@ i@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ ts strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation .
It was not something people wanted .
As the trial got underway , the AC@@ L@@ U of Nevada warned on its website : " It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-@@ fle@@ dged tracking devices . "
There is no need to build an enormous , u@@ n@@ w@@ i@@ e@@ l@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inev@@ itably be expanded to keep records of individuals ' everyday c@@ o@@ m@@ ings and g@@ o@@ ings .
Nevada is among several states now scram@@ bling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
If you can do that , Khan said , the public gets more comfortable .
The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ u@@ p called True M@@ i@@ l@@ e@@ age .
The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .
It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mil@@ e@@ age .
But the devices it is testing appeal to highway plann@@ ers because they don 't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information , u@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ a@@ d@@ ed perio@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ ally by m@@ o@@ d@@ e@@ m .
" People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , " said Ryan Mor@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on , chief executive of True M@@ i@@ l@@ e@@ age .
There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .
There are a lot less expensive and less intru@@ sive ways to do this .
In Oregon , plann@@ ers are exper@@ i@@ m@@ enting with giving drivers different choices .
They can choose a device with or without GPS .
Or they can choose not to have a device at all , opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more , not less .
In New York City , transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide " pay-@@ as-you-@@ drive " insurance , and create a pool of real-@@ time speed data from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to avoid traffic .
" Mot@@ o@@ r@@ ists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , " says a city planning document .
Some transportation plann@@ ers , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction .
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area , officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bank@@ rupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes .
An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don 't use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
" There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspir@@ in , " said Randy Rent@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ ler , the commission 's director of legislation and public affairs .
If we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .
David Bow@@ ie : Four U@@ n@@ published Song@@ s Released
The British musician is full of s@@ u@@ r@@ prises this year .
Following The Next Day , released in January , he has put together a del@@ u@@ x@@ e r@@ e@@ -@@ release planned for November 04 , featuring several u@@ n@@ published tracks .
Four have already appeared on the Internet .
The announcement that David Bow@@ ie was releasing a new album had stunned the world .
On 08 January 2@@ 0@@ 13 , the date of his 66@@ th birthday , he announced that a new album would be released in March .
After ten years of silence ( his last record , Reality , was released in 2003 ) and very few public appearances , the British musician proved that he could still light up the pop scene .
A feast for fans
Not tired of making s@@ u@@ r@@ prises , David Bow@@ ie had more than one trick up his sleeves with The Next Day :
the T@@ h@@ in White Duke was also planning to r@@ e@@ -@@ release the album on November 04 .
He put together a real feast for his fans to mark the occasion .
This r@@ e@@ -@@ release , titled The Next Day E@@ x@@ tra , was presented in the form of three disks : the original album , u@@ n@@ published studio sessions and r@@ e@@ mix@@ es , plus a DVD containing the four clips that have already been unveiled .
The Next Day E@@ x@@ tra had a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album : the three songs from the Del@@ u@@ x@@ e edition , five songs specially unveiled for the occasion , and two r@@ e@@ mix@@ es .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , David Bow@@ ie has introduced this fine b@@ o@@ x@@ -@@ set through a video .
In it , he presents each of the disks plus the access@@ ories provided with them : exclusive photos and sleeves , a notebook for sharing your own impres@@ sions , a book@@ let of lyrics e@@ t@@ c .
And finally , he gives a t@@ e@@ a@@ s@@ er to his new track , At@@ o@@ m@@ ica , which is typically in the style of The Next Day , with very prominent guit@@ ars and s@@ k@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ fully controlled rock e@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ s .
Previously U@@ n@@ published Trac@@ ks Released
However , At@@ o@@ m@@ ica is not the only track to have been released .
The I@@ n@@ former , Like A Roc@@ ket Man and Born In A U@@ F@@ O are also available on the net .
The I@@ n@@ former is double-@@ edged - an u@@ n@@ settling i@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ o followed by a brilliant rush of sound that p@@ r@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ v@@ ely slow@@ s down to make way for a pop ball@@ ad .
Was Bow@@ ie trying to make a reference to Elton John 's Roc@@ ket Man , or even Grav@@ ity , in his Like A Roc@@ ket Man ?
Either way , with this cheer@@ ful track , the singer seems to be in his element when his feet are no longer on the ground .
Space Od@@ dity , by comparison , was much more solem@@ n .
On Born in a U@@ F@@ O , David Bow@@ ie once again refers to his strang@@ eness : could he have come from another planet ?
The s@@ p@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ b@@ i@@ n@@ ding guitar r@@ i@@ ffs make you want to leave Earth .
In any case , Bow@@ ie enjoys playing the c@@ h@@ a@@ m@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ on in these tracks : in turn , an i@@ n@@ former , a rocket man , possibly a M@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ an ...
He v@@ e@@ ils and reveals at the same time , and likes to take on different person@@ alities , as he has throughout his career , most notably with his person@@ as : Z@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ y S@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ ust and A@@ l@@ add@@ in S@@ ane .
It is therefore not surprising that he should be holding a mas@@ k in the promo@@ tional photography for L '@@ Inv@@ itation au Vo@@ y@@ age , by Louis Vu@@ itton , of which he is the new face .
He appears in one of their a@@ d@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ts , broadcast from November 10 .
The Minister of Defence , Rob N@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ son , insisted that injured soldiers are not summar@@ ily discharged from the Canadian Armed Forces and stressed that all soldiers undergo a transition process before their return to civilian life .
Att@@ acked by liber@@ als and neo-@@ d@@ e@@ m@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ ats in the House of Comm@@ ons , Mr. N@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ son assured that , prior to their d@@ i@@ s@@ charge , members of the army underwent a transition plan in collaboration with their superi@@ ors .
" All injured soldiers receive the appropriate care in preparation for their return to civilian life and none has been discharged before being ready , " he asserted .
The detractors are accusing the government of trying to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the army 's rule of " univers@@ ality of service , " which requires that personnel be able to carry out a series of varying tasks - to reach the ten-year period of a@@ d@@ missi@@ bility required for retirement benefits .
They have specifically noted two cases reported in La P@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ se C@@ a@@ n@@ a@@ d@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ ne , one involving a soldier discharged last Friday .
Lance Corpor@@ al David Haw@@ kins , a r@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ t from London , Ontario , was diagno@@ sed with post-@@ traumatic stress disorder and discharged from the army , despite asking to be kept on for another year to receive a f@@ u@@ l@@ ly-@@ index@@ ed pension .
His case follows that of Lance Corpor@@ al Glen Kir@@ k@@ land , who declared before a parliamentary commission last month that he had been forced to leave before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of univers@@ ality of service .
Mr. Haw@@ kins stressed that a soldier could be prepared for his departure , with planning and consultation sessions , but that this was totally different than wanting to leave the army .
" I told them I wasn 't ready , " he said in an interview with La P@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ se C@@ a@@ n@@ a@@ d@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ ne on Wednesday .
" For several months , I asked if there was a way that I could stay on , and they said no , " he adds .
Since the start of major combat in Afghanistan , the army has struggled to determine what l@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ de it can give to injured soldiers who want to stay in the army but are not capable of combat .
Under the current rules , seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployment , they can be forced to leave the army .
The data presented to parliament last year indic@@ ates that , of the 1,2@@ 18 soldiers discharged for medical reasons , 1@@ 9@@ 9 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits .
On Wednesday , the liberal spokesman for former service personnel , Jim Kar@@ y@@ g@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ is , asked for Lance Corpor@@ al Haw@@ kins to be reinst@@ ated , while the neo-@@ d@@ e@@ m@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ at Jack Harris demanded an immediate end to " this shame@@ ful practice . "
Disney to La@@ unch New A@@ n@@ i@@ m@@ ated Series on Tab@@ let PCs
American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to give priority to t@@ a@@ b@@ let PCs over its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children .
The first nine episodes of Sheriff C@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ e 's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the site watch@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ n@@ e@@ y@@ j@@ u@@ n@@ i@@ or.com or via its application for mobile phones and t@@ a@@ b@@ lets .
The global launch on the Disney group channels is not planned until 2014 , according to the press release from its Disney Juni@@ or division .
The a@@ n@@ i@@ m@@ ation , aimed at children aged 2 to 7 , is about the adventures of the cat , C@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ e , the sheriff of a town in the Wild West where she keeps law and order using a magic l@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ o .
Each episode contains two 11-@@ minute stories .
" I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ acting with smar@@ t@@ phones and t@@ a@@ b@@ lets is second nature for children today , " notes Albert C@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ g , vice-president of digital products at the Disney / ABC Television Group , in a q@@ u@@ o@@ te in the press release .
This kind of experience is part of Disney 's efforts to " extend the lifetime of its series and build new relationships with audiences via digital platforms that are becoming ever more important , " he added .
A survey published by Common S@@ ense Media at the beginning of the week showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of children under 2 already use a t@@ a@@ b@@ let or mobile phone , and 72 % of under 8@@ s , compared to 10 % and 38 % respectively two years ago .
S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den ready to " cooperate " with Germany over US surveillance
Edward S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den , the US intelligence whist@@ leblower , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to provide answers about its activities .
German MP H@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ -@@ Christian S@@ t@@ r@@ ö@@ b@@ e@@ le on Thursday met Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den in Russia , where he has been granted asy@@ lum , to discuss him testi@@ fying in Germany .
A letter from Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by the MP , said : " Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as d@@ e@@ f@@ ection , and seeks to crimin@@ alise political speech with felony charges that provide no defence . "
However , speaking the truth is not a crime .
In the letter , Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him .
The charges filed by the US justice department include espi@@ onage and theft of government property .
H@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ -@@ Peter F@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ d@@ rich , German i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ior minister , told Z@@ e@@ it Online : " If Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den is ready to speak to German officials , we will find ways to make this possible . "
Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the N@@ SA b@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ed Chancellor Angela 's Merkel 's phone .
Thomas Op@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ n , the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence , said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den as a witness " without bringing him into danger and completely r@@ u@@ i@@ n@@ ing relations with the US , " it should be taken .
Mr S@@ t@@ r@@ ö@@ b@@ e@@ le , an MP for Germany 's Green party , published a picture of himself with Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den on his Tw@@ itter feed .
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists .
Mr S@@ t@@ r@@ ö@@ b@@ e@@ le said that , according to the former N@@ SA contractor 's lawyer , Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den would not be able to return to Russia if he left .
If Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be " safe " there , the MP said .
Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den said in his letter that he had faced a " severe and sustained " campaign of persecu@@ tion that forced him from his home .
However he said that he was hear@@ tened by the worldwide response to " my act of political expression . "
Citi@@ zens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the rev@@ e@@ l@@ ation of an u@@ n@@ accountable system of p@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ a@@ s@@ i@@ ve surveillance to be a public service .
The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities " when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved . "
Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o C@@ able Soon to Offer I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ active TV ?
Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o C@@ able subscribers may soon have access to applications like Facebook , Tw@@ itter and , ultimately , the Net@@ fli@@ x vide@@ o@@ -@@ o@@ n@@ -@@ demand service through their television in a seemingly not too distant future .
The Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the b@@ e@@ t@@ a version of this platform with some of its users .
" This will enable us to develop more u@@ s@@ er-@@ friendly interfaces and larger numbers of options , " explained the president and CEO of Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o , Louis Aud@@ et , in an interview .
Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o C@@ able is thus following in the path of its competitors , like Bell , even though the Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o subsidiary does not yet have a precise launching date for this new platform .
" We need to adap@@ t and change or resist change and fail , " emph@@ a@@ s@@ ized Aud@@ et .
The ultimate goal is still to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to .
The t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ communications giant R@@ o@@ gers has already indicated that it might offer Net@@ fli@@ x if certain technical details ( which it did not cite ) could be s@@ o@@ r@@ ted out .
In the United States , the popular video service is said to be discus@@ sing the possibility of making its service available via their broadcasting platforms with some major cable companies .
The CEO of Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o and Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o C@@ able also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech from the T@@ h@@ r@@ one on October 16 .
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the option of a@@ c@@ c@@ essing the services on a pay-per-@@ view basis .
" We have been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to purchase major pack@@ ages of channels doesn 't work , " stated Aud@@ et .
Nevertheless , he hopes that the consultations carried out by the Canadian Radi@@ o@@ -@@ television and Telecommunications Commission ( C@@ RT@@ C ) will give rise to interesting recommendations .
" These discussions need to produce a new type of reference framework for the definition of the new cultural policy in Canada relating to television , " said Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o 's CEO .
The C@@ RT@@ C has been conducting consultations with the public since last week , and these will be continued with the industry next spring .
In terms of results , Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o has said it has recorded a net profit of CA@@ D 43.@@ 8 million in the fourth quarter , representing 82 ¢ per share .
This is a drop compared to the net profit of CA@@ D 44.@@ 9 million , or 83 ¢ per share , recorded in the same period last year .
The M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ based company says this drop is due to d@@ e@@ preciation expenses relating to recent acquisitions .
In 2012 Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o bought US@@ -based cable distributor , Atlantic Broad@@ band , for CA@@ D 1,3@@ 60 million .
This was the company 's first major acquisition after its failed aqu@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ tion attempt in Portugal .
The Montreal company also bought P@@ e@@ er 1 Network Enter@@ prises , an Internet services provider based in Vancouver , for CA@@ D 5@@ 26 million last December .
In terms of revenue , Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o saw growth of 4@@ 1.5 % in the fourth quarter , reaching CA@@ D 50@@ 4.7 million .
Its revenue stands at CA@@ D 1@@ ,@@ 800 million for the current financial year .
The net profit of its principal subsidiary , Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o C@@ able , was CA@@ D 43.@@ 9 million , or 90 ¢ per share , down from CA@@ D 45.@@ 7 million , or 93 ¢ per share , for the same period last year .
Nevertheless , Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o C@@ able saw a 45 % growth , reaching CA@@ D 47@@ 0.4 million .
The company lost 15,@@ 2@@ 37 customers during the fourth quarter .
Even so , the number of Cog@@ e@@ c@@ o C@@ able customers rose by 5@@ ,@@ 5@@ 46 for the 2@@ 0@@ 13 fiscal year .
Aud@@ et is not concerned by this fluctu@@ ation in the company 's number of customers .
" For me , this does not indicate a change in trend , " he noted .
" It v@@ aries from one quarter to the next in the face of very liv@@ ely competition . "
Hor@@ se in B@@ e@@ ef Products
Hor@@ se meat has been detected in b@@ e@@ e@@ f-@@ based canned food products sold by two small British low-cost distribution retailers , the Food Standards Agency announced today .
Routine tests revealed that products processed in Romania in January and sold by shops of the Home B@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ ains and Quality S@@ ave chains contained between 1 and 5 % of horse DNA .
" Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , it should not have been present in the product , " the British agency explained .
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in prepared meals had broken out in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests carried out in Ireland .
According to investigations by the European Commission , France the most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products which are supposed to contain beef only .
Two vehicles colli@@ de on Rou@@ te 131 in L@@ a@@ n@@ audi@@ è@@ re leaving four injured Friday morning .
Just before 4@@ am , a driver heading north towards S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ F@@ é@@ l@@ i@@ x@@ -@@ de-@@ Val@@ ois lost control of his vehicle and crashed into another car travelling in the opposite direction .
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured , though not l@@ e@@ t@@ h@@ ally .
Traffic returned to normal at around 6@@ am .
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier Airlines to charge for carr@@ y@@ -@@ on b@@ agg@@ age
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers to store carr@@ y@@ -@@ on luggage on board their flight .
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for a carr@@ y@@ -@@ on bag and $ 2 for coffee or soda , although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can .
The new carr@@ y@@ -@@ on fee is for bags in the overhead bin , so small bags under the seat will still be free .
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , $ 100 if travelers wait to pay until they 're at the gate .
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said the $ 100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance .
" We don 't want to charge that , " she said .
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .
Pass@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ers trying to avoid those fees have been stu@@ ffing as much as they can into carr@@ y@@ -@@ on b@@ agg@@ age s@@ t@@ ashed in overhead bins , meaning those bins often run out of space .
Fe@@ es are one way to get passengers to bring less on board .
O 'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money .
It 's about F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier 's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult .
Pass@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ers who buy their tickets on the airline 's website won 't have to pay .
That means one passenger in line at a F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier gate might get to bring a bag on for free , while the next person in line might o@@ we $ 100 for a similar bag .
O 'Malley said F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier 's website and c@@ h@@ e@@ c@@ k@@ -@@ in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate .
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier 's new carr@@ y@@ -@@ on fee won 't start until summer , though a date hasn 't been set .
Pass@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ers often g@@ r@@ u@@ m@@ ble about b@@ agg@@ age charges and other fees , but airlines love them .
They argue that luggage costs money to handle , and passengers who want the service should pay for it .
Many on Wall Street view the addition of b@@ agg@@ age fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Most haven 't touched carr@@ y@@ -@@ on bag fees , though .
S@@ p@@ i@@ r@@ i@@ t Airlines Inc. started the first carr@@ y@@ -@@ on fee three years ago , and fellow d@@ i@@ s@@ counter A@@ l@@ l@@ e@@ giant Air later followed .
The only other airline with such a fee is Hun@@ gary 's Wiz@@ z Air , said airline consultant Jay Sor@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ en , who closely tracks add-@@ on fees .
He estimated in a December 2011 report that S@@ p@@ i@@ r@@ i@@ t 's carr@@ y@@ -@@ on fee brings in $ 50 million a year .
Sor@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ en , a former executive with Mid@@ west Airlines , flew S@@ p@@ i@@ r@@ i@@ t recently and won@@ dered what he 'd find at the gate as passengers encountered S@@ p@@ i@@ r@@ i@@ t 's unusual carr@@ y@@ -@@ on bag fee .
" The boarding process was the smooth@@ est I had seen in my airline career , " he said .
I was expecting to see g@@ n@@ ashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate .
The plane was full , he said , " and it boarded l@@ i@@ c@@ ket@@ y@@ -@@ split . "
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier is also following S@@ p@@ i@@ r@@ i@@ t 's $ 2 charge for coffee , tea , soda , or j@@ u@@ ice .
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier said passengers who get soda or j@@ u@@ ice can keep the whole can , and it will give coffee r@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ s for free .
It will still give away water .
US Airways briefly tried charging for bever@@ ages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed .
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier 's move to charge the carr@@ y@@ -@@ on fee if passengers don 't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website .
Airlines pay online travel sellers such as O@@ r@@ b@@ i@@ t@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
That has given all airlines an incenti@@ ve to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency .
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier has gone the fur@@ thest in this area , though .
In September it began giving half as many frequent f@@ lier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency .
On Wednesday it sl@@ ashed the mil@@ e@@ age award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip .
So , a 1,000 mile F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier website .
F@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ tier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver , but its business is shrinking and losing money .
Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc .

The shadow@@ y National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a gli@@ t@@ ch that brought down its public website for a few hours , not hack@@ ers as some claimed online .
" N@@ SA@@ .gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , " the spy agency said in an emailed statement .
The issue will be resolved this evening .
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed den@@ ial of service [ D@@ Do@@ S ] attack are not true .
Earlier this evening online server t@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ ers noted the N@@ SA 's website had been down for at least six hours , and the site continues to be i@@ n@@ accessible for some users .
Earlier an N@@ SA spokesperson told ABC News the agency 's internal , sensitive network was " not at all " compromised .
No classified information is in danger , the spokesperson said .
At least one hack@@ t@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ t group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the N@@ SA site with a D@@ Do@@ S attack .
D@@ Do@@ S attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collap@@ ses .
The cy@@ ber tacti@@ c is a relatively u@@ n@@ sophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to p@@ e@@ n@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ ate the internal network of the target system .
The formerly super secre@@ tive N@@ SA , once n@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ named No Such Agency , has found itself in very public light , and amid vicious criticism , in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collec@@ tively the product of secret N@@ SA files stolen from the agency and leaked by d@@ i@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ chanted former N@@ SA contractor Edward S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den .
Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight 's incident was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
Delta C@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ -@@ V@@ ille Clo@@ ses
Delta C@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ -@@ V@@ ille Hotel in Montreal closed its doors on Thursday after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will convert it into student resid@@ ences .
The hotel had three hundred and fif@@ ty employees .
Of these , 200 have still not found a new job .
Delta has promised not to abandon its employees .
Employers have come to meet employees on site and have met with the employees individu@@ ally to assess their needs .
" That support will continue for the next six months , " explains the regional lab@@ our relations director at Delta hotels , Felix Bis@@ son .
The closure of the Delta comes at a time of great competi@@ tiveness in the hotel market .
The investment fund that owned the building had to make a choice .
It had to either r@@ e@@ invest in the building to continue using it , which would require investments worth tens of millions of dollars while competition is fierce as a lot of new hotels have appeared in Montreal .
or sell it to someone else , which is what happened , " explains Paul A@@ r@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t , holder of the Tran@@ sat Chair in Tour@@ ism at the School of Management at the U@@ Q@@ AM .
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months , such as the Crown Plaza , which will become a home for the elderly .
Meanwhile , four hotel projects t@@ o@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ ing almost 600 rooms will be implemented in the next two years .
" Plan to buy Good@@ year A@@ m@@ i@@ ens will begin with zero employees , " Tit@@ an CEO says
After dramatically throwing in the tow@@ el in January over the partial taking over of the Good@@ year site in A@@ m@@ i@@ ens North , which is due to close , Maur@@ ice Taylor , CEO of American tire manufacturer , Tit@@ an , now says that he is ready to save 3@@ 33 of the factory 's 1,1@@ 37 employees .
Arnaud M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ g , Minister of Industrial Recovery , had already announced this on Monday October 21 .
After giving up the plan to buy the factory in January , today you are back .
You had fired violent attacks and insul@@ ts , talking of ' so-called workers ' who ' work three hours ' a day , and ' mad ' unions , targeting the CG@@ T .
It 's hard to understand this U@@ -@@ turn .
Is this meant to please Mr. M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ g ?
I 'm not trying to please anyone .
Except my wife .
Mr. M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ g is a c@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ ming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs .
I 'm sorry if my words have offended anyone .
But there are high levels of tax and unemployment in France too .
Does the truth offend you ?
Working seven hours a day when people in other countries are working eight hours is holding France back .
In India , China and many other countries , people work ten to t@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ ve hours a day .
But I don 't have prejud@@ ices about France .
What I see is a factory which manufactures good agricultural tires , has good equipment , a good location and plenty of room for growth .
Why does Tit@@ an need this factory so much ?
Tit@@ an doesn 't need to buy this factory .
But , if the price is right and the workers are qualified , it 's worth trying .
What sort of agreement do you expect between the CG@@ T and Good@@ year ?
If Good@@ year had offered the employees a good sever@@ ance package after announcing that the factory was closing , I think 100 % of the employees would have accepted it .
Now , let 's imagine that Tit@@ an b@@ u@@ ys a closed factory from Good@@ year .
At that point , Tit@@ an could choose to move the mach@@ inery to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency .
I think Mr. M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ g knows that .
However , he wants to keep the factory in A@@ m@@ i@@ ens with at least 3@@ 33 well-@@ paid employees .
Tit@@ an has agreed to recruit them from the 1,200 or so people currently working for Good@@ year .
Also , Mr. M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ g needs a commitment from Tit@@ an before trying to get the CG@@ T to sit down with Good@@ year .
The first step is for the CG@@ T and Good@@ year to s@@ e@@ al an agreement on sever@@ ance pay for all the employees .
Then there won 't be any employees left in the factory .
Mr. M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ g has said that you were prepared to guarantee these 3@@ 33 jobs for four years .
Can you confirm that ?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 3@@ 33 .
I know he would like a four-@@ year guarantee .
But , as I said to you , the CG@@ T and Good@@ year must first reach an agreement on the sever@@ ance pay .
If all the employees accept it , the project of buying Good@@ year A@@ m@@ i@@ ens will begin with zero employees .
How can we give guarantees on the length of employment when there are no employees left on site ?
If Mr. M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ g gets the CG@@ T and Good@@ year to reach an agreement and Tit@@ an b@@ u@@ ys the factory , we have every intention of staying in A@@ m@@ i@@ ens North for more than four years .
Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier profit d@@ i@@ ps as plane deliveries , orders fall
Canadian plane and train maker Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday , pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit .
M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ based Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier also did not release any flight test data for its b@@ r@@ and-@@ new C@@ Series aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September .
After the test plane 's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago , it has only flown three more times , raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track .
Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sli@@ ding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Cameron Do@@ e@@ r@@ k@@ sen , an analyst with National Bank Financial , lowered his rating to " sector perform " from " outperform " on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited u@@ p@@ side over the next one or two quarters .
" While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated , we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation , " Do@@ e@@ r@@ k@@ sen said in a client note .
We believe that Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier will receive new orders for the C@@ Series as the flight test program progres@@ ses .
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program .
Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier hopes the C@@ Series aircraft family can c@@ a@@ t@@ a@@ p@@ ult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays .
But firm orders for the C@@ Series are moderate so far at 1@@ 7@@ 7 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to vali@@ date the company 's claims about the new j@@ e@@ t@@ liner 's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential .
There are currently 4@@ 03 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators .
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beau@@ d@@ o@@ in was confident Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use .
E@@ x@@ e@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ ves also r@@ e@@ assured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule .
" The test plane didn 't stay on the ground longer than anticipated , " Beau@@ d@@ o@@ in said in a conference call , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane 's downtime .
Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way .
We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that 's what we have done .
That will happen all through the flight program .
The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks , with the r@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ der following shortly after , the company said .
Still , analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a C@@ Series plane 12 months after its m@@ a@@ i@@ den flight .
Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier said it was evalu@@ ating the e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ -@@ i@@ n@@ to-@@ service ( EIS ) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months .
" This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier 's internal schedule apparently - rein@@ forces our view that e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ y@@ -@@ i@@ n@@ to-@@ service will be pushed to Q@@ 1 / 15 , " said Do@@ e@@ r@@ k@@ sen .
For the third quarter ended September 30 , Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier 's net profit fell to $ 1@@ 4@@ 7 million , or 8 cents per share , from $ 1@@ 7@@ 2 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .
Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents .
Revenue dipped margin@@ ally to $ 4.@@ 1 billion from $ 4.2 billion .
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $ 4.@@ 56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S .
The world 's fourth-@@ largest plan@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ k@@ er said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter , down from 57 a year earlier .
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft , from 83 .
The back@@ log in the aerospace division was $ 32.@@ 9 billion as of September 30 , unchanged from December 31 .
" In aerospace , results were in line with our guidance , but the low order i@@ n@@ t@@ ake and overall market conditions were a disappointment , " Beau@@ d@@ o@@ in said .
Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier , the world 's largest train@@ maker , said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
The order back@@ log in the transportation unit was $ 32.@@ 6 billion as of September 30 , up margin@@ ally from December 31 .
The transportation division 's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts .
E@@ x@@ e@@ c@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ ves said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter .
Shares of Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier , which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pich@@ ette would join the board , were down 8.@@ 5 percent at C $ 4.@@ 83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday .
Brazil 's E@@ m@@ bra@@ er SA , the world 's third-@@ largest commercial plan@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ k@@ er and Bom@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ dier 's closest rival , reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday .
Two p@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ ders aged 23 and 27 went missing in a cave under the D@@ ent de Cr@@ o@@ l@@ les on Thursday evening , according to a report from the I@@ s@@ è@@ re cave rescue organization on Friday .
They were found on Friday afternoon .
The two men , one experienced , the other not , set off underground on Thursday at around 9.@@ 30@@ pm , in an attempt to cross the D@@ ent des Cr@@ o@@ l@@ les , which is in the district of S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ P@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ -@@ de-@@ C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ use .
There was no news of them after this , said the same source .
" The p@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ ders were due to return at around 5@@ am , " said Thi@@ e@@ r@@ ry L@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ be , technical consultant at the c@@ a@@ v@@ e@@ -@@ rescue organization who organized the rescue efforts .
Do@@ zens of people on site
Tw@@ enty or so rescu@@ ers , ten civilian members of the French c@@ a@@ v@@ e@@ -@@ rescue organization , as well as the police , mountain rescue services and firefighters were on hand .
The two p@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ ders were found late on Friday afternoon .
" Another group of p@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ ders found them in the h@@ o@@ l@@ low exhausted but in good health and got a message to one of the rescue teams working in the network of tun@@ n@@ els , " explained local newspaper , Le D@@ a@@ u@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ é .
The two men , who are soldiers in the 13th Battalion of French A@@ l@@ pine Troops stationed in Cham@@ b@@ é@@ r@@ y , were found " exhausted but u@@ n@@ injured . "
They got lost in the network , but retrac@@ ed their steps while waiting for assistance , said the police .
After being given supplies , they are expected to exit the cave in the evening with the help of the rescu@@ ers .
German J@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ alists Ur@@ ged to Shun Google and Yahoo
The union of German journalists urged its members to stop using Google and Yahoo online services on Thursday , following new revelations concerning the activities of the American and British intelligence services .
" The German Federation of J@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ alists is recommending that journalists avoid using the Google and Yahoo search engine and mess@@ aging services until further notice , " it said in a press release .
It calls the reports in the Washington Post " scand@@ alous . " According to these , the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) in America and the Government Communications Headquarters ( G@@ CH@@ Q ) in Britain have gathered loads of information by infil@@ trating international networks , enabling the two bodies to syn@@ chron@@ ize their servers .
" The research carried out by journalists is just as confidential as the details of their sources and the nature of their communication with them , " added Michael Kon@@ ken , president of the union , which has 3@@ 8,000 members .
R@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ted Traffic Lights : MP A@@ s@@ ks Brig@@ i@@ t@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els to Resign
Not everyone is pleased with Minister Brig@@ i@@ t@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els ' plan to give traffic light posts in Brussels a " f@@ a@@ c@@ e@@ -@@ lift . "
The Minister of Public Works and Tran@@ sports in Brussels had launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday , consist@@ ing in r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ting 16 traffic light posts in the yellow and blue colours of the Brussels region .
The aim of this is to both " increase safety " and " enhance the identity of Brussels . "
The idea is to eventually r@@ e@@ p@@ aint all the traffic lights in Brussels , at an estimated cost of one million E@@ u@@ r@@ os .
But the blue chosen by the Minister is " too dark , " according to Brussels MP E@@ m@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ u@@ el De B@@ ock , who talks of the " F@@ l@@ e@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing " of the capital and is demanding the resignation of Brig@@ i@@ t@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els .
" Not content with spending Brussels residents ' money like water on this scheme of giving traffic light posts a f@@ a@@ c@@ e@@ -@@ lift with the colours of the Brussels region , Brig@@ i@@ t@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els is continuing her efforts to turn the capital F@@ l@@ e@@ m@@ ish , " says an angry De B@@ ock in a press release .
After her m@@ a@@ n@@ go yellow and black tax@@ is , she has ended up r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ting the posts in Brussels yellow , dark blue and black .
According to the MP , there is now " no difference in visual c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ u@@ ity between F@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ ers and Brussels .
The residents of Brussels deserve better than to see their money was@@ ted by a Christian Democratic and F@@ l@@ e@@ m@@ ish Minister , who is carrying out the New F@@ l@@ e@@ m@@ ish Alliance program herself .
It is high time the F@@ l@@ e@@ m@@ ish Tro@@ jan Hor@@ se was stopped .
Let 's not forget , Brig@@ i@@ t@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els was elected by 2,2@@ 45 votes , that is 0.5 % of Brussels i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants ! " De B@@ ock conclu@@ des .

The eco@@ tax p@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o in Pon@@ t@@ -@@ de-@@ Bu@@ is , around which a violent demonstration against the tax took place on Saturday , was taken down on Thursday morning .
C@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ es arrived on the site just after 1@@ 0@@ am , and traffic on the main road was diver@@ ted afterwards .
The decision to take the p@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o down , which was announced by the F@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ è@@ re police department on Wednesday , was taken by E@@ c@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ v , the company managing the p@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o .
This was the last of three eco@@ tax p@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o@@ s still operating in the department of F@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ è@@ re , the other two having been taken down or sab@@ o@@ t@@ aged .
Google Glass Acc@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ ories S@@ hop La@@ u@@ n@@ ched
An online shop offering a range of access@@ ories for Google Glass has just been launched for the thousands of developers who own a protot@@ ype of the Goo@@ g@@ l@@ e@@ -@@ branded , web@@ -@@ enab@@ led glasses .
It means they can now get head@@ phones , a c@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ er or even a storage case .
The shop , which is stric@@ tly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass , offers some access@@ ories , such as a c@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ er and USB cable , for $ 50 .
It is also possible to get a micro@@ -@@ fiber prote@@ ctive cover or in-@@ ear head@@ phones for the same price .
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with c@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ tive lenses , no date for a full-scale launch has yet been announced .
Five years ago , my father passed away .
At first , I was in den@@ ial about his death . I spoke of him in the present tense .
I was afraid of f@@ o@@ r@@ getting him , or perhaps I did not know how I was going to continue to " spend time " with him .
There is no formula , no method for passing through the wall of the invisible to be with your loved ones .
Then signs started to appear .
The first time I had this very strong feeling of his presence , he was in the passenger seat while I was driving .
Another time is when I q@@ u@@ i@@ e@@ t@@ ly woke up in the middle of the night and went to look at his watch , which I always have with me , lying on the bed@@ side table .
The smiling image of my father stays with me during my everyday activities .
Our mother left us after an exhau@@ sting fight against cancer .
At least , that is what I thought when I saw the shell of her stiff body under the crum@@ pled sheets of the hospital bed .
Similarly , her funeral was a cold goodbye focused on the dim light of the cand@@ les surrounding her coff@@ in .
I thought she had gone .
G@@ r@@ adu@@ ally , by way of tiny and slightly faint or f@@ a@@ d@@ ed appearances during the day and night , she soon came back into my life , evolving as she took back her place in the landscape of my mind which thought it was still in mourning .
And then she revealed herself by showing me aspects of myself I had never seen before , that were hidden by my relationship with her .
Thus , I lear@@ nt and understood that I had not lost my mother herself at all , just a woman that I did not know very well , a woman who embo@@ died her during her stay on this earth .
In dying , this woman had completed her life and freed the person that I loved , and now she was back , whole and complete .
This detour in the path of my life is still the most unexpected and beautiful thing .
It is a privilege to know that the people we love never leave us .
I am like my father , " inside and out , " it seems .
I have always been told that .
I never believed it at the time .
I had a difficult relationship with him until he became old and ill .
At that point I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him .
One day , he died .
For a long time , he stayed with me - when I stopped smoking , when I was afraid , when I was ill ...
He would speak to me , const@@ antly encourage me , he lived in my body .
I would see his hands when I looked at mine ; I lent him my body .
But this was never indis@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ et .
I could still lead a personal life .
He allowed me my privacy .
That lasted a long time , then one day he was gone .
In the end , it felt comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged , advised .
I don 't know who it was that said that those who die are not forgotten but invisible .
My parents are no longer here but I feel them close to me const@@ antly .
In every event , every moment of my life , I feel their presence , and I am always referring to them : what would they say , what would they think , what would they do ?
I const@@ antly dream of them , perhaps not every night , but several times a week for sure .
I often dream of the last moments I shared with them before it was too late , except that there is still one thing that prevents me from enjo@@ ying the moment .
I often wake up dist@@ ressed because it hits me and I feel their absence deeply .
Sometimes , some dreams affect me d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ently and make an impression on my mind , so , in effect , they continue to live and be a part of my life .
On the day before my ultr@@ a@@ s@@ ound , when I was going to find out the gender of my baby , I d@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ m@@ t that I woke up and h@@ a@@ u@@ led myself out of bed , and my father was waiting for me on the landing . He was smiling at me and was happy that I was expecting a little boy .
The following day , I had the feeling that he had come to visit me in my dream to tell me that he was sharing the joy I was feeling .
And , yes , I was indeed carrying a boy .
I loved sharing that moment with him and enjoy talking of that shared memory that happened after his death .
Exact@@ ly five years ago , my g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mother died of cancer .
One year previously , she had travelled with my family to Cuba .
H@@ ence the shock that her loss provoked in the young graduate I was then .
In spite of everything , I said my good@@ b@@ yes fairly quickly .
But she continues to influence my life , particularly in when I 'm going through hard times , or when I have to make an important decision .
D@@ e@@ c@@ i@@ ding to learn Arabic and pursuing an interest in the Middle East , to the point of doing a Masters at a major university , in h@@ i@@ n@@ d@@ sight , were not t@@ r@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ al decisions .
Actu@@ ally , I often used to listen to her speak Arabic during my childhood and talk about Mor@@ o@@ c@@ co where she had lived for decades before coming back to France when it became independent .
The values she i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ l@@ led in me are still there , so I often end up wonder@@ ing what she would want me to do at a given moment .
It 's the same with my opinions : I try to live up to the gener@@ os@@ ity and c@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ ness of her mind as a fervent believer .
Now@@ a@@ d@@ ays I feel her as a daily presence , a ben@@ evol@@ ent force , a saving spirit .
I see her eyes resting on me .
My mother died n@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ t@@ een years ago now .
She died after talking to me on the telephone .
I went through all the stages : i@@ n@@ compreh@@ ension , anger , grief , tears that would come on their own , anywhere , a@@ n@@ y@@ time , in unusual places , at i@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ r@@ u@@ ous moments .
But time eased the pain .
Now there is just the gap , the silent e@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ iness , the need for her to e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ ust me , to reassure me in the palm of her gent@@ l@@ eness .
Yet , she is there , a silent presence , watching me .
Every morning I see her worried eyes looking at me , I see the dark rings giving her a b@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ ened look , the wrink@@ les around the l@@ i@@ ps d@@ u@@ g by cigarettes , the lines that mark the fore@@ head on days of worry .
My mother has taken possession of my face , and every morning she looks back at me in the mirror .
And every morning , I look away .
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43 .
We always feel her protecting us , nothing bad will happen to us .
This was her promise on her death bed ; so , gradually , we lear@@ nt to smile again , and saying her name is no longer tabo@@ o but a comfort .
Of course , I talk to her at the dead of night when the absence hurts too much , and she comes into my dreams when my spirits are a little low .
We feel supported and protected in difficult moments , and the passage of time has made us r@@ e@@ alise that she was the c@@ o@@ n@@ d@@ u@@ ctor , with us trying to stay on the path she had drawn for us .
If somebody truly loved you , their absence cannot tear them out your heart or your memories .
In a way , the person you loved becomes your inner energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 to a@@ s@@ bes@@ t@@ o@@ s@@ -@@ related cancer .
I was very close to him , I always acted according to what he would have thought or would have appreciated .
I was unable to attend his burial , and three weeks after his death , I gave birth to a little boy .
Sometimes my beliefs are different from his , so I am always asking myself if what I am doing c@@ o@@ n@@ forms with his way of seeing things .
I have even had problems at work because of these convictions .
However , I can 't do otherwise ; I lose sleep and const@@ antly ask myself what he would think .
I don 't know if I have adopted his way of thinking or if I am simply like him - is it genetic ?
Whatever the case , he will always be my point of reference .
He was a bit like an alter e@@ go , we didn 't even need to speak .
In short , he is there every day .
I feel his presence and it makes me happy .
Almost thir@@ ty years ago , my husband died aged 33 .
I was 28 and our son was 6 .
The immense pain that engulfed me has eased of course , but he is still close to me .
He very often " turns up " in my dreams , in a very specific way , so vivid that when I wake up I am sad again when I r@@ e@@ alise that it was just a dream .
The other night , he asked me how I was ; I said not good , and he said " I 'm coming down , " but in a voice so real that I woke up with a start , upset , and I switched on the bed@@ side lam@@ p and looked around , convinced that he would come .
I still live in the same house and , frequently , I feel he is watching me ; I turn round and see he isn 't there , but I know it 's him and I talk to him .
I feel his presence in every room and it makes me happy .
I wouldn 't leave this house for anything in the world . We were happy here and his spirit lives here with me .
I 'm 58 and I have always lived alone since losing him . He is and will remain the love of my life .
I should say that I am rather s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ able and have a job with r@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ i@@ b@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ties . I laugh and sing , I go out , I 'm a g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mother , I have lots of friends , but my heart and my soul belong to him . I never talk about him except with my son , and I never go to the c@@ e@@ m@@ etery .
October : Bloo@@ diest M@@ o@@ n@@ th in Iraq Since 2008
October was the bloo@@ diest month in Iraq since April 2008
Baghdad published official figures on Friday : 9@@ 64 people lost their lives last month - 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 police and 44 soldiers .
The publication came on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister met the American President .
Nour@@ y al-Maliki is seeking aid from the United States .
" We are not asking the world to stand by our side and support us , but we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it , " declared Al-@@ Maliki in Washington this Thursday .
" And because if what is happening in Iraq is not handled , it will spread , as will what is happening in Syria .
And what happens when the virus of terrorism is alive ? It s@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ ads . "
Nour@@ y al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute of Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .
Outside the building , demonstr@@ ators were protesting against the Iraqi leader .
They were b@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing p@@ l@@ a@@ c@@ ards accusing him and others of being murder@@ ers and appealing to the United States to refuse to give him aid .

A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation , because he feared his secret drug a@@ d@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ tion would be exposed , has been j@@ ailed for three years .
Bas@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ at D@@ i@@ t@@ ta , 42 , would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scar@@ b@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ gh about inqui@@ ries into his drug traff@@ icking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit .
The solic@@ itor , who was n@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ named " B@@ ash " and h@@ ailed by criminals as a " top brief , " was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scar@@ borough , who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial .
Officers spotted S@@ a@@ r@@ borough , 32 , dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer 's home in Blackburn , L@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ a@@ s@@ hire , while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues .
I@@ n@@ q@@ u@@ i@@ ries revealed D@@ i@@ t@@ ta was a " regular user " of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet and on his credit cards .
Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to i@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ t@@ ly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scar@@ borough as well as one of his associates .
All four suspects were being watched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a hero@@ in and cocaine r@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ et operating across L@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ a@@ s@@ hire , Cumbria , M@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ e@@ y@@ side , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .
They and 32 other men were later j@@ ailed after police seized hero@@ in and cocaine worth £ 1@@ .@@ 5@@ million along with more than £ 200,000 in cash during a series of raids .
D@@ i@@ t@@ ta , 42 , fed information to criminals because of fears his cocaine a@@ d@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ tion would be exposed
Today at Liverpool Crown Court D@@ i@@ t@@ ta , who works at law firm Forbes Solic@@ i@@ t@@ ors , based in Blackburn , was facing disgrace after being found guilty of two counts of p@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ting the course of justice following a three week trial at Liverpool Crown Court .
He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing .
The lawyer 's down@@ fall came after police investigating Scar@@ borough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with D@@ i@@ t@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at D@@ i@@ t@@ ta 's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a pur@@ ity of 60 per cent under the lawyer 's bins in a black golf glove .
Soon after the drop off , Scar@@ borough was in regular phone contact with D@@ i@@ t@@ ta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn R@@ o@@ vers football stadium , E@@ wood Park .
The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them .
The court heard D@@ i@@ t@@ ta was a " regular user " of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair , wallet and on his credit cards
D@@ i@@ t@@ ta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to " legal privilege . "
During his arrest D@@ i@@ t@@ ta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken f@@ o@@ m him .
In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business .
But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain , some of whom he had previously represented , after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them .
Prosecu@@ ting , Anne W@@ h@@ y@@ te said : " If anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal solic@@ itor . "
Mr D@@ i@@ t@@ ta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solic@@ itor , having become too involved with specific clients .
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs .
Some of his communications will u@@ n@@ doub@@ tedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer .
But this went way beyond the ordinary confin@@ es of a l@@ a@@ w@@ y@@ er-@@ client relationship .
He t@@ h@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ ted the police 's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities .
Mr D@@ i@@ t@@ ta was not hon@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ ing his profession , but d@@ i@@ s@@ hon@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ ing it .
He got too close to certain clients , in particular Scar@@ borough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .
D@@ i@@ t@@ ta denied wrong@@ doing and claimed : " If I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scar@@ borough , I would not wait 15 hours , I would do it immediately . "
But after the hearing Supt Lee Hal@@ stead from L@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ a@@ s@@ hire Police said : " Mr D@@ i@@ t@@ ta turned from criminal solic@@ itor to a criminal himself the moment he started o@@ b@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ing drugs from organised criminals . "
His a@@ d@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ tion to cocaine left him hop@@ e@@ l@@ essly compromised and vulnerable to the m@@ o@@ tives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations .
Solic@@ i@@ t@@ ors should uph@@ old the highest standards of integrity and should i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ l trust and confidence in the public .
Mr D@@ i@@ t@@ ta has betr@@ ayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the v@@ e@@ n@@ eer of his profession .
L@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ a@@ s@@ hire 's Serious and Organ@@ ised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr D@@ i@@ t@@ ta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now p@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ting the course of justice , demonstr@@ ating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice .
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
We will find you and put you before the courts .
Scar@@ borough himself was j@@ ailed for 14 years after p@@ leading guilty to conspiracy to supply hero@@ in , cocaine and cannabis .
Thir@@ ty five other men involved in the r@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ et were j@@ ailed for a total of 1@@ 5@@ 3 years for drugs o@@ f@@ f@@ ences .
On his website D@@ i@@ t@@ ta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America , his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motiv@@ ation for work .

Class@@ ical S@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ing for T@@ e@@ e@@ n@@ a@@ g@@ ers
The student body has , each time , been the target of an initiative that had a lot of success last season .
T@@ e@@ e@@ n@@ a@@ g@@ ers have been given the chance to get to gri@@ ps with class@@ ical singing through five short plays created and performed by regional artists - performances containing a large dose of humour .
Besides this show , the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ é@@ t@@ é d '@@ Art Ly@@ r@@ i@@ que du Roy@@ a@@ u@@ me will be bringing back " Dest@@ i@@ n@@ ations Ly@@ r@@ i@@ ques , " a program that has been a c@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ d@@ -@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ler at La P@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ ie in Chic@@ o@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ mi .
Two other concerts will be held in the summer of 2014 , giving regional artists the chance to show what they are capable of .
In addition to these events , there was the Ap@@ é@@ r@@ o Ly@@ r@@ i@@ que , the benefit concert held last August , with the support of color@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ a s@@ o@@ p@@ r@@ ano , Mari@@ e@@ -@@ Eve Mun@@ ger .

New Class Action Claim Against Holy Cross Brothers
A new class action claim has been filed against the brothers of the Cong@@ r@@ e@@ g@@ ation of the Holy Cross involving sexual a@@ s@@ s@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ ts , allegedly carried out , this time , at the S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ Joseph O@@ r@@ atory and several orph@@ a@@ n@@ ages , colleges and schools .
The claim is based on the testimony of an a@@ p@@ p@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ant identified as " J. J , " who would have been mas@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ ated in the 1950s , first at N@@ o@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ -@@ Dam@@ e@@ -@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ -@@ N@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ es by his teacher , Brother S@@ o@@ u@@ m@@ is , then by his c@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ or , F@@ a@@ ther Bernard , at the S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ Joseph O@@ r@@ atory , where he was an a@@ l@@ t@@ ar boy and where his father worked as a pain@@ ter .
" The first action involved only three institutions , and when the ruling was announced , many people said to us : ' I was assaulted at so and so place , can I add my name ? " says lawyer A@@ l@@ ain A@@ r@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t , who is defending the victims in the two actions .
The class action that has just been filed specifically enables the i@@ n@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion of plaintiffs from any institution where members of the Cong@@ r@@ e@@ g@@ ation of the Holy Cross may have been involved in abuses .
Currently , the action combines the complaints of 25 individuals who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers of the Holy Cross .
The alleged deeds generally took place before those cited in the first action as many of the institutions concerned were closed in the 1960s .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , the action speci@@ fies that the Cong@@ r@@ e@@ g@@ ation of the Holy Cross and the S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ Joseph O@@ r@@ atory , which is a separate entity , " allowed acts of sexual abuse to be committed against children , " that they " exer@@ cised moral , religious and psych@@ ological constr@@ aint over the victims , " and that they " knew about sexual a@@ s@@ s@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ ts committed but kept quiet " and " deliberately and c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ously chose to ignore the problem . "
The latter accusations are partly based on letters written by the lawyer of the brothers of the Holy Cross , Mr E@@ mile Perrin QC , in the 1990s , as well as through research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy , a former brother of the Holy Cross who has publicly denounced the abuses .
The class action must first be deemed a@@ d@@ missible by the Superior Court .
Once the Court has declared it a@@ d@@ missible , it will proceed to the second stage , the preliminary hear@@ ings .
In the first action , the Cong@@ r@@ e@@ g@@ ation of the Holy Cross agreed to settle out of court before preliminary hear@@ ings were conducted .
Serious Fire in S@@ hop
A fire caused serious damaged to a shop in the LaSalle district of Montreal on Thursday night .
The emergency services were called at around 1@@ am on Friday for a fire which had broken out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Doll@@ ard Avenue , near the j@@ u@@ n@@ ction with Rue R@@ e@@ j@@ a@@ n@@ e .
It tool the thir@@ ty-@@ something firefighters who rushed to the scene almost an hour to bring the flames under control .
The fire " caused significant damage to the structure of the building , " said the chief of operations of the Montreal Fire Department , Richard Bor@@ d@@ e@@ aux .
The cause of the fire is unknown , however there was nobody in the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene .
There were no casualties , but close to twenty f@@ l@@ ats on the first and second floors of this row of shops had to be evacuated .
The Red Cross was called in given that the residents of one of the a@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ ments might need temporary accommod@@ ation , according to the Fire Department .
Great Opposition to Med@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ Ass@@ isted Death at P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Congress
The Canadian P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Congress , holding in Ottawa this week , comes several days after the vote in favour of the bill on medic@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ assisted death in Quebec .
Several p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care associations used the opportunity to r@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ate their d@@ i@@ s@@ approval .
" If every ill person had access to effective care to r@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ eve their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , very few of them would wish to end their lives , " said a spokesperson for the Canadian P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Association , M@@ a@@ r@@ y@@ se B@@ o@@ u@@ v@@ ette .
" If emphasis was put on p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care in Canada , the call for euthan@@ asia would become minimal , " she added .
The C@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ person of the Quebec P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Network also rejects the bill on medic@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ assisted death .
A@@ l@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ te D@@ é@@ r@@ y is concerned about the consequences for future gener@@ ations if it is adopted .
" What is the meaning of life ? " she lam@@ ents .
The majority of p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care homes will refuse to help patients die , according to the vice-president of the Alliance of P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Homes , Suz@@ anne F@@ i@@ t@@ z@@ back .
Mrs F@@ i@@ t@@ z@@ back , who is also the director of the M@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ u@@ -@@ F@@ r@@ o@@ m@@ ent-@@ S@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ ie Home in Gat@@ i@@ n@@ eau , thinks the service would be useless anyway .
" Nobody ever says to us : ' I want to die , give me an injection . "
The director of the P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Association of Ontario , Rick F@@ i@@ r@@ th , believes that the Quebec bill is confusing people with regard to the purpose of p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care .
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit .
Meanwhile , the liberal MP of Gat@@ i@@ n@@ eau , Stephanie Val@@ lee , thinks that the concept of termination of life needs to be clari@@ fied before the bill can be adopted .
Kenyan press o@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ aged at controversial media law
" It is a frigh@@ tening place , and it is vali@@ d to ask : what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? " the paper said , challenging the bill as unconstitutional .
" This law is draconian and very p@@ u@@ n@@ i@@ tive and we reject it , " said Cy@@ rus Kam@@ au , managing director for Capital Group - home to Cap@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ FM , one of Kenya 's most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
He said the new media t@@ r@@ i@@ b@@ u@@ n@@ al " will always be b@@ i@@ ased because it 's an extension of the government , " and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya 's place in the global economy .
" I hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs , " he said .
According to The Star newspaper , the new bill will effectively hand the government " a strang@@ l@@ e@@ hold over the media , " while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been " dealt a major blow " and lam@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ ted the bill as " draconian . "
The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to rein@@ force national security in the wake of the September 's attack by Islam@@ ist gunmen on the West@@ gate shopping mall .
Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera foot@@ age of troops who were d@@ i@@ s@@ pat@@ ched to the scene of the attack purportedly rob@@ bing the u@@ p@@ market mall .
Police chief David Kim@@ a@@ i@@ yo reacted by s@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ ing two journalists and a media executive for questioning , although the s@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ ons was retrac@@ ted following a media outcry .
Under the new bill , media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan s@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being " de-@@ listed , " or barred from receiving official press accre@@ dit@@ ation .
The t@@ r@@ i@@ b@@ u@@ n@@ al also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid .
According to the Daily Nation , " even one fine is enough to crip@@ ple most FM stations . "
It also said the measures could have a devast@@ ating effect on what it described as Kenya 's " liv@@ ely blo@@ g@@ o@@ s@@ p@@ here . "
By sil@@ encing the media , politicians know they can do whatever they like with i@@ m@@ p@@ unity .
" No one will ever know , " wrote Nation journalist Mut@@ u@@ m@@ a M@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ i@@ u , describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life .
" Left to themselves , politicians would bank@@ rupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering , " he wrote .
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past .
In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and rein@@ state their hefty salaries of around 53@@ 2,000 s@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ings a month tax-@@ free - ranked among the highest in the world .
D@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ t Year for Pharmac@@ ists
The departure of almost 10 pharmacists from the Centre for Health and Social Services ( CS@@ SS ) in L@@ a@@ v@@ al has caused turmoil a@@ m@@ i@@ d@@ st the managers of the Cit@@ é@@ -@@ de-@@ l@@ a@@ -@@ San@@ t@@ é hospital in the year 2@@ 0@@ 12-@@ 2@@ 0@@ 13 .
The p@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ acy department has been left seriously short-@@ staff@@ ed following multiple depar@@ tures due to retirement , matern@@ ity leave or , simply , resignations .
There is a staff shortage of almost 30 % , making the financial year " very difficult " according to department head , Gilli@@ an Beau@@ d@@ et .
Even so , the CS@@ SS has decided not to employ independent lab@@ our , which could be up to three times more expensive than taking on a full-time pharmac@@ ist .
" We didn 't resort to a stop@@ -@@ gap solution , " explained Beau@@ d@@ et .
" We consolidated or reduced some of our activities within the institution to get around while waiting for things to fall back in place .
We clearly worked hard on trying to persuade our young [ p@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ acy residents ] to come and stay here .
A combination of circumstances put us in a difficult situation last year . "
Im@@ proved situation
After this difficult period , 2@@ 0@@ 13-@@ 2014 looks like a definitely easier one for the p@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ acy department at the CS@@ SS .
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after matern@@ ity leave and three others have been taken on in recent months .
In addition , the efforts made by the department to hold on to staff have paid off , as the four students currently in residence in L@@ a@@ v@@ al have also decided to stay on at the CS@@ SS .
" Things are going much better now , " stressed the pharmac@@ ist .
" By the end of the financial year , we will have seven new pharmacists and three back from matern@@ ity leave .
So that will fill the gaps we had last year . "
Need still growing
However , the situation is still p@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ ous .
Several factors , such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a p@@ r@@ e@@ domin@@ ance of young women in the profession , make situations like that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict .
" For us [ the number of staff ] is always p@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ ous as this is a young environment where a lot of young women are being employed . So in terms of pregn@@ ancies , you can always count on three people being on matern@@ ity leave when things are going well , " she added .
" Last year there were many more and there were no pharmacists available to replace them , so it was more difficult . "

CG@@ R Theatre in Nar@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ ne Ev@@ acu@@ ated on Thursday Even@@ ing
The first showing of a film at the Mega CG@@ R theatre in Nar@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ ne was interrup@@ ted on Thursday evening out of precaution after viewers reported a t@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ling sensation in the thro@@ at .
The theatre director immediately began an evacuation procedure and called the fire b@@ r@@ i@@ g@@ ade to check out a suspicious s@@ m@@ ell .
Around 70 people were evacuated from the viewing .
They were examined , and a thorough check of the c@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ m@@ a revealed nothing .
Was it a bad joke involving tear gas ?
Or was it an i@@ n@@ v@@ o@@ l@@ u@@ n@@ tary incident ?
Either way , the management of the theatre decided to implement the principle of precaution and put the safety of its customers first .
The c@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ m@@ a was v@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ l@@ ated and everyone returned in good order .
The c@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ m@@ a was able to show itself in a good light and the customers could continue enjo@@ ying events u@@ n@@ folding ...

Woman Tri@@ es Smu@@ ggling 2@@ kg of C@@ o@@ c@@ aine Inside P@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ kins
Taking advantage of Halloween , a woman tried to smu@@ g@@ g@@ le two kilos of cocaine hidden inside p@@ u@@ mp@@ kins into the country through M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ Tru@@ d@@ e@@ au Airport on Thursday morning .
The drugs were detected when passenger luggage was checked .
The cocaine was split between three p@@ u@@ mp@@ kins that had been previously h@@ o@@ l@@ lowed out .
The drugs were subsequently taken to the office of the Royal G@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ ie of Canada ( G@@ R@@ C ) , which then took over the investigation .
The Canada Border Services Agency ( CB@@ SA ) did not reveal where the woman had been travelling from when she was intercep@@ ted .
" That is part of the investigation , " indicated Jacqueline R@@ o@@ by , spokesperson for the CB@@ SA .
" What I can tell you is that she was entering the country . "
Since the start of 2@@ 0@@ 13 , the Canada Border Services Agency at M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ Tru@@ d@@ e@@ au Airport has conducted 173 drugs seiz@@ ures , of which 10 involved seiz@@ ures of cocaine t@@ o@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ ing 44 kil@@ o@@ grams .
In 2012 the Border Services Agency for the province of Quebec made 1,6@@ 53 seiz@@ ures of narcotics .
Air R@@ aid Against Military I@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ ations in Syria
Israeli a@@ i@@ r@@ cra@@ fts entered Lebanese air space early on Wednesday afternoon , but did not carry out attacks until the evening , according to the Lebanese army .
A c@@ a@@ r@@ go of short range SA@@ -@@ 8 ground-@@ to-@@ air missiles was targeted and destroyed .
This latest raid by the Israeli air force in Syrian territory ( the sixth since the start of the year , according to the Israeli daily newspaper , Ha@@ aretz ) has been confirmed neither by Israel nor Syria .
The raid took place under circumstances almost identical to that of July 5 : on that occasion , it was also an u@@ n@@ named American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack that targeted Yak@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ t ground-@@ to-@@ air missiles supplied to Damascus by Russia .
Israeli officials made no attempt to hide their anger when Washington revealed the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to respond .
Ukraine Close to Economic Coll@@ apse
R@@ ating agency , Standard & Poor 's , reduced Ukraine 's credit rating on Friday , casting a doubt on the ability of the former Soviet republic , which has been in recession for a year , to meet its financial obligations .
The government debt rating moved to B@@ - , further down into the category of speculative investments .
This rating is accompanied by a negative outlook , with S & P seeing at least one chance in three that it will downgrade the rating again in the next year .
" It is increasingly unlikely that the government 's strategy will make it possible to sufficiently guarantee foreign currencies to meet its increased external financial commitments , " explained the American agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine 's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2@@ 0@@ 13 , and the trend is expected to continue .
This complic@@ ates the r@@ e@@ payment of credit from abroad .
These reserves , which the authorities have had to use extensively to support the local currency , the h@@ r@@ y@@ v@@ nia , are collapsing , leading to the agency considering d@@ e@@ v@@ alu@@ ation more and more likely , which would inflate the country 's foreign debt .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , Kie@@ v needs liquid assets to pay for its gas imports from Russia , which accuses it of not having paid a bill of 8@@ 82 million dollars .
The announcement comes as bad news for the U@@ k@@ rain@@ ian government in a period of serious tension with its Russian n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ our , which is fur@@ i@@ ous with Kie@@ v 's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
This was made public the day after the publication of official statisti@@ cs showing that the country 's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarterly drop between July and September .
Its debt , which is still relatively modest , has exploded in recent years . S & P estimates it as 33.@@ 5 % of the GDP , as opposed to 10 % prior to the crisis of 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 8-@@ 2009 .
Experi@@ encing a b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ t@@ ary deficit , the country has been asking for aid from the International Monetary Fund for months . The latter , in 2010 , had given the former a 15,@@ 300 million dollars loan , but this time it has released just 3,400 million .
The IMF is refusing to pay any further i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ ments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , especially by increasing the price of gas for the population .
Following a fru@@ i@@ t@@ less mission to the country , the IMF noted this week that " the significant need for external finance " represented " a weakness , " even though there were " signs of economic improvement . "
However , for the economist , O@@ l@@ e@@ k@@ sand@@ r Jol@@ oud , from the Centre for Political Stu@@ dies , " no improvement can be expected in the short term . "
" There is little hope of unpopular reforms being made in a pre-@@ election year , " said the expert in an AFP interview . Presidential elections are planned for 2@@ 0@@ 15 .
The only hope is for an improvement in international circumstances .
S & P notes , fur@@ thermore , the " uncertainty " linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU , which for Brussels is conditional on the release of opposition leader Yuli@@ a Tim@@ o@@ c@@ h@@ enko .
" Sig@@ ning the agreement would be good for business in the long term , but it might have negative consequences in the short term in r@@ e@@ l@@ ation to Russia 's reaction , " explained S & P , which is concerned Moscow may introdu@@ ce " trade restrictions . "
Russia , which is responsible for a quarter of U@@ k@@ rain@@ ian exports , has warned that if a free trade area is created between the EU and Kie@@ v , it will have to rein@@ force its border controls for imported goods .
US Gre@@ en-@@ lights Publi@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ -@@ Om@@ nic@@ o@@ m Merger
Publi@@ c@@ is and Om@@ nic@@ o@@ m said on Friday that they had not received any objec@@ tion from the American authorities to their plans to m@@ e@@ r@@ ge , thus bringing closer the creation of the world 's biggest advertising agency .
The merger brings together the world 's second largest agency , Om@@ nic@@ o@@ m , and the third largest , Publi@@ c@@ is .
" The Om@@ nic@@ o@@ m Group and Publi@@ c@@ is Group today announced the e@@ x@@ p@@ i@@ r@@ y of the period of investigation into the previously announced merger of the Publi@@ c@@ is Group and Om@@ nic@@ o@@ m , under the H@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ -@@ Scot@@ t@@ -@@ R@@ o@@ d@@ ino Anti@@ trust Im@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ v@@ ements Act of 1976 , as a@@ m@@ ended , " the two groups announced in a press release .
They specified that they had also received the necessary author@@ i@@ s@@ ations from Canada , India and Turkey , in addition to those from South Africa and South Korea .
The e@@ x@@ p@@ i@@ r@@ y of the period of investigation provided for by the HS@@ R in the United States and the author@@ i@@ s@@ ation decisions issued in the other juris@@ dictions satis@@ fy many of the conditions necessary for the move to take place .
" The merger is also conditional upon o@@ b@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ing other regulatory author@@ i@@ s@@ ations and the approval of the two groups ' shareholders , " they add .
C@@ o@@ n@@ gol@@ ese Army Hun@@ ts Down M@@ 23 Rebels
The C@@ o@@ n@@ gol@@ ese army ( F@@ A@@ R@@ DC ) announced on Thursday that its units would be hunting down M@@ 23 rebels right up to their bases located in the forests and mountains of North K@@ i@@ v@@ u , which borders Rwanda and Uganda .
The M@@ 23 appears to be on the verge of defeat , having been driven out of the towns in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( R@@ D@@ C ) , which it had been in control of since the start of the uprising 20 months ago .
" We will pursue the M@@ 23 and drive it out of wherever it is hiding because they are criminals , " C@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ n@@ el Olivier Ham@@ uli , spokesman for the F@@ A@@ R@@ DC , declared to Reuters .
" We must not allow them to r@@ e@@ group because they have been making the C@@ o@@ n@@ gol@@ ese people suffer for too long .
The time has come for peace to be restored . "
Leaders of the M@@ 23 say they evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and B@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ r@@ and Bis@@ i@@ m@@ w@@ a , political leader of the rebellion , asserted on RF@@ I that these military set@@ backs would not change its demands at the peace talks in any way .
According to the U@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ an medi@@ ators , talks between the government in Kin@@ s@@ h@@ a@@ s@@ a and the M@@ 23 r@@ e@@ s@@ u@@ m@@ ed in Kamp@@ ala on Wednesday , .
Skir@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ hes were reported in the hills above Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana , the last town in the hands of the rebels to fall this week , and around Run@@ y@@ oni , a hill where the M@@ 23 rebellion started in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insurgents occupied G@@ oma , the capital of the province of North K@@ i@@ v@@ u , taking advantage of the retreat of the government g@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ on and the i@@ n@@ action of the M@@ o@@ n@@ u@@ s@@ co blue b@@ e@@ r@@ ets .
The fall of G@@ oma led the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the largest in the world in terms of numbers , to rein@@ force its mand@@ ate and form a rapid intervention force consist@@ ing of soldiers from South Africa , Mal@@ awi and Tanz@@ ania .
Meanwhile , F@@ A@@ R@@ DC staff has been reshuffled and the army has gone on the offensive against the M@@ 23 , changing the course of the war .
The rate of progress of the government troops today is unprecedented .
" The M@@ 23 seems to be n@@ e@@ aring its end , " predicted an expert in C@@ o@@ n@@ gol@@ ese affairs , Jason Stearns , on his blog Congo Si@@ a@@ s@@ a .
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kin@@ s@@ h@@ a@@ s@@ a has succeeded in q@@ u@@ ashing a major i@@ n@@ s@@ u@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ tion .
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that there is no armed group allied to Rwanda present in the east of the R@@ D@@ C .
United Nations experts a@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ se Rwanda of providing military support to the M@@ 23 , which has initially made up of m@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ ous former C@@ o@@ n@@ gol@@ ese soldiers . Rwanda vehem@@ ently denies this .
The British Foreign Secretary , William H@@ ague , called on the R@@ w@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ an President Paul K@@ a@@ g@@ ame to show restraint , a Foreign Office spokesman announced .
Last week , K@@ i@@ g@@ ali raised the possibility of military retaliation after s@@ h@@ ells landed in R@@ w@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ an territory .
On Wednesday , the i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants of Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana took to the streets of the town to welcome the entry of the F@@ A@@ R@@ DC troops .
" We have been living with the M@@ 23 for a year and it seemed u@@ n@@ imagin@@ able that we would one day be freed by the army , " said an i@@ n@@ habit@@ ant of the town on the border with Uganda .
" We have been living in terror [ of the M@@ 23 ] , we are t@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ sed , " the man added .
Tests carried out by the Pas@@ t@@ eur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the c@@ o@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ us turned out negative , the Ministry of Health has announced .
It specified that " the two cases identified in May 2@@ 0@@ 13 remain the only confirmed cases in France to date . "
The 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being infected on Tuesday , after returning from a trip to Saudi Arabia , where the disease has already killed about fif@@ ty people .
Che@@ v@@ ron , the second largest oil company in America , announced a drop in quarterly profits on Friday , as a result of a reduction in its refining margins , although its production of oil and gas increased while still being below the group 's target .
Its net profit for the third quarter went down to $ 4,9@@ 50 million , or $ 2@@ .@@ 57 per share , as opposed to $ 5@@ ,@@ 250 million , or $ 2@@ .@@ 69 per share , the previous year .
Analysts questioned by Reuters were counting on an average profit of $ 2@@ .@@ 71 per share .
The group produced 2@@ .@@ 59 million oil-@@ equivalent barrels per day during the course of the quarter , an increase compared to the 2@@ .@@ 52 million barrels per day produced a year before .
The company is targeting 2@@ .@@ 65 million barrels per day for this year , with an increase of 25 % in production planned by 2017 .
The majority of the growth in the years to come will come from its lique@@ fied natural gas schemes in Australia .
Because of the cost of these schemes , annual investment costs have gone up by seven thousand million dollars in two years and are expected to reach 36,@@ 700 million dollars in 2@@ 0@@ 13 .
The profits from production activities went down slightly in the third quarter , while profits from downstream activities ( including refining and chemical production ) fell 45 % to 3@@ 80 million dollars .
The reduction in refining margins is affecting the entire sector .
Che@@ v@@ ron 's main competi@@ tor , Exxon , also announced a drop in net profits on Thursday , despite an increase in its gas and oil production .
School Transport : Compl@@ aint Jud@@ ged A@@ d@@ missible
Since the beginning of the academic year , the Sher@@ brooke Region School Board ( CS@@ R@@ S ) has been demanding a $ 150 fee per student ( to a maximum of $ 300 per family ) for students using school transport to get to two addresses , a service that the organisation offers when it is able to .
No financial contribution had been demanded prior to the changes made to the last budget .
" The Board proposed a medi@@ ation service and I was interested , " says Mrs L@@ e@@ f@@ e@@ v@@ re .
According to her , the CS@@ R@@ S was invited to a medi@@ ation and she asked for an additional period for consideration .
" It is always better to discuss , consul@@ t and find solutions such issues , " Mrs L@@ e@@ f@@ e@@ v@@ re believes .
The Sher@@ brooke Region School Board ( CS@@ R@@ S ) did not wish to comment on the issue .
The organisation merely indicated that the medi@@ ation was part of a process a@@ r@@ ising from a complaint .
Row Over Clo@@ sure of Emergency Unit at H@@ ô@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ -@@ D@@ i@@ eu
In light of the rebellion that has been running for several months involving a section of the staff and several unions , including the CG@@ T , the Minister of Health , M@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ ol Tour@@ aine , decided on July 10 to " put back the schedule for implementing the project and , in particular , the date for closing the emergency unit which cannot take place on November 4 . "
This was an official request made so as " not to run any risks when dealing with emergency services in Paris at the start of winter , " but also aimed at avoiding to h@@ i@@ n@@ der the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ alist Party 's campaign a few months before local elections .
Despite the minister 's instructions , the closure is n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless expected to take effect on this date .
At the A@@ PH@@ P , officials prefer the term " transformation " or " change in c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ u@@ ity " to closure .
From November 4 , the units of the fire b@@ r@@ i@@ g@@ ade , which accounted for a quarter of the 40,000 cases brought to the emergency unit of the H@@ ô@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ -@@ D@@ i@@ eu each year , will all have received instructions to take their about thir@@ ty serious cases per day to the emergency units of other hospitals in Paris .
November 4 is also the day on which hospital training resu@@ mes .
At the H@@ ô@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ -@@ D@@ i@@ eu , i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ns speci@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ ing in emerg@@ encies will make way for five general medicine i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ns on Monday .
The transfer of internal medicine beds is scheduled for some point during the month .
" The H@@ ô@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ -@@ D@@ i@@ eu emergency service has to close as soon as possible , and for us , that 's November 4 , " L@@ o@@ ï@@ c Ca@@ p@@ r@@ on , the c@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ person of the medical committee ( C@@ ME ) at the A@@ PH@@ P which supports the management project , says strai@@ ghtforwar@@ dly .
" On November 4 , patients will no longer be brought by the fire b@@ r@@ i@@ g@@ ade , there will only be people arriving by their own means , " confir@@ ms Professor J@@ e@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Y@@ ves F@@ agon , chief medical officer at the new H@@ ô@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ -@@ D@@ i@@ eu .
" However , we will continue accepting emergency cases , " he temp@@ ers , emph@@ a@@ s@@ ising the permanent presence of emergency medical service vehicles on site to move critical cases .
" Senior emergency doctors will remain on site , " he also a@@ s@@ s@@ ures .
But the decision to close the emergency service r@@ e@@ sides with the regional health agency ( A@@ R@@ S ) .
" Things are moving gradually , " says Nicolas Pé@@ j@@ u , spokesman for the A@@ R@@ S , for whom " there will be no change in terms of the service offered , " come November 4 .
" The minister has either lied to us or has been lied to , " lam@@ ents emergency medical officer , G@@ é@@ r@@ a@@ l@@ d Ki@@ e@@ r@@ z@@ ek .
Dismissed from his position as head of emergency services in early July for taking a stand against the reorganisation project , he defin@@ es himself as a " whist@@ l@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ lower " in the face of a " cyn@@ ical " decision taken by the " technical medical administration body . "
" They are in the process of abandoning and killing off emergency units that were r@@ e@@ formed less than five years ago , " he believes .
For him , " if the other emergency services in Paris were able to absor@@ b the surplus , there wouldn 't be a problem . "
But they are regularly satur@@ ated .
For example , there is sometimes a nine hour wait at the emergency unit at L@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ b@@ o@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ è@@ re .
The A@@ R@@ S stresses that thir@@ ty patients " d@@ e@@ s@@ pat@@ ched " to several locations does not run the risk of becoming an " avalanche " for the other emergency services , where human resources would have been reinforced anyway .
The A@@ R@@ S , like the A@@ PH@@ P , is defending the " new hospital model " which started being implemented on October 7 and is expected to continue taking 30,000 to 35@@ ,000 patients a year .
By the end of the year , self-@@ employed GPs are also expected to participate in the implement@@ ation of an " a@@ m@@ bul@@ atory care service . "
" Where are we heading if we start asking people to self-@@ diagno@@ se ? " asks G@@ é@@ r@@ a@@ l@@ d Ki@@ e@@ r@@ z@@ ek , for whom " the concept of a non-@@ major emergency " is " dangerous " and marks a " medical step back@@ wards . "
" The same thing will happen as with level 3 matern@@ ity units .
People are not stupid , they will go wherever the best care is offered . "
" If the minister does not take a step by Monday , we will take a different approach , " warns C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ p@@ he P@@ r@@ u@@ d@@ homme , emergency medical officer and member of the healthcare CG@@ T .
" We will have a greater presence in the local election campaigns and we will think about putting up a list . "
In N@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ e K@@ o@@ sci@@ u@@ s@@ k@@ o@@ -@@ M@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ z@@ et 's team , Vin@@ cent Roger , a U@@ MP c@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ or in Paris and MP of the 4@@ th a@@ r@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ ement , states clearly that " even if the U@@ MP in Paris supports the c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ u@@ ation of emergency services at H@@ ô@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ -@@ D@@ i@@ eu , it would be technically and financi@@ ally impossible to reopen them if you look at the duties . "
Ann Hid@@ a@@ l@@ go , the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ alist Party 's candidate , repeated on Monday morning on France I@@ n@@ ter that she was in favour of a moratorium to prevent the closure on November 4 .
If it went ahead , she would register her clear d@@ i@@ s@@ agreement , stresses Bruno J@@ u@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ard , her spokesman .
" Even though the reorganisation of the H@@ ô@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ -@@ D@@ i@@ eu has an u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ lying justi@@ fication , we cannot let this happen without an acceptable plan for the transfer of patients to other hospitals . "
Obama E@@ n@@ ds Sp@@ ying on IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) to stop tapping the lines of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities , said an American official on Thursday .
This decision is part of attempts by the White House to resume control of the N@@ SA phone-@@ tapping affair following revelations by the former analyst , Edward S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den , who has taken refuge in Russia .
This is the first time that surveillance of the IMF and World Bank by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal .
When asked about this , an official of the American administration replied : " The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance aimed at offices of the World Bank and IMF in Washington . "
Talking under the c@@ l@@ o@@ ak of anonymity , the official did not specify whether such surveillance had taken place in the past .
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had given the order to stop these practices during recent weeks .
The instruction was given at almost the same time as that putting an end to phone-@@ tapping of the UN headquarters in New York .
In this regard , the Senate Intelligence Committee approved s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ t@@ h@@ ening of the controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday , but still author@@ ised them to proceed .
The committee introduced new restrictions on the data that the intelligence services were author@@ ised to collect and imposed a limit of five years on the length of time they could hold such data .
UN h@@ ails new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the m@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ n@@ i@@ um development goals , which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty .
Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for " sustain@@ able development goals " to replace the MD@@ G@@ s , which expire in 2@@ 0@@ 15 , ahead of the UN sustain@@ able development summit that began in Rio de Jan@@ e@@ iro overnight .
They were included in the final draft of the document , which will be endor@@ sed by world leaders including Ms Gill@@ ard during the summit .
UN Secret@@ ary-@@ General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight that now is the time to " rise above national interests . "
" I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustain@@ able development goals - S@@ D@@ G@@ s , " he said .
These S@@ D@@ G@@ s will build on our advances under the m@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ n@@ i@@ um development goals , and they will be an i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ g@@ r@@ al part of the post-@@ 2@@ 0@@ 15 development framework .
I will spare no effort to implement the mand@@ ate given to me by member states to r@@ e@@ alise our vision of sustain@@ able development goals that build on the success of the MD@@ G@@ s .
Moz@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ que security concerns mount as powerful person@@ alities clash
With a statue of Sam@@ ora M@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ el , Moz@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ que 's founding president , s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ing down on them , thousands of people gathered in central M@@ a@@ p@@ u@@ to to chant peace s@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ ans in a rare public demonstration .
" We want peace back ; we want stability , " said Vanessa de Sousa , chief executive of an investment company .
Fear@@ ful about the future of her country , she s@@ w@@ apped her corporate a@@ t@@ t@@ i@@ re for a T-@@ shirt e@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ a@@ z@@ oned with " we demand security " in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital 's I@@ n@@ depend@@ ence Square on Thursday .
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Ren@@ amo , some of the worst s@@ k@@ i@@ r@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ hes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago .
Ren@@ amo was once a notori@@ ous rebel movement , initially backed by white-@@ ruled Rho@@ desia and then South Africa 's a@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ id government as part of efforts to destabili@@ se the country 's independent government .
After a 1992 peace deal , it became an opposition party .
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-@@ blown conflict , but recent events have u@@ n@@ ner@@ ved foreign investors and locals .
The s@@ t@@ akes are high for the fast-@@ growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $ 50@@ bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto , Vale of Brazil , E@@ n@@ i of Italy and A@@ n@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ r@@ ko of the US .
The ruling Fre@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o party , the dominant political force since 1975 , and Ren@@ amo blame each other for the tension .
Ren@@ amo says the government initi@@ ated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sof@@ ala province , traditionally a Ren@@ amo s@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ h@@ old , on October 17 .
Ass@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ ts on the former rebels then escal@@ ated as government forces attacked Ren@@ amo bases and attempted to kill A@@ f@@ o@@ n@@ so Dh@@ lak@@ ama , the group 's leader , Fernando Maz@@ anga , Ren@@ amo 's spokesman , told the Financial Times .
The government blames Ren@@ amo for trigg@@ ering the clashes , accusing it of attacking soldiers .
President A@@ r@@ mand@@ o G@@ u@@ e@@ b@@ u@@ za has sought to play down concerns about instability .
Mr G@@ u@@ e@@ b@@ u@@ za told AFP , the French news agency , on Wednesday that Mr Dh@@ lak@@ ama saw himself as a " l@@ o@@ s@@ er " who wanted to use " whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions . "
Both Fre@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o and Ren@@ amo insist they want to avoid war .
But concerns have grown after Mr Maz@@ anga was quoted as saying Ren@@ amo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord .
He told the F@@ T that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Fre@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o .
" Our vision is to come back to negotiations , but with seriousness , " Mr Maz@@ anga said .
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year .
" It 's two big men ( G@@ u@@ e@@ b@@ u@@ za and Dh@@ lak@@ ama ) b@@ u@@ t@@ ting heads together , " said Joseph Hanlon , a lecturer at the Open University and Moz@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ que expert .
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary .
Ren@@ amo , which has been pushing for electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November .
Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year .
Some comment@@ ators have interpre@@ ted its use of force as the attempt of an a@@ i@@ l@@ ing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government .
Ren@@ amo 's share of the vote has been declining since 1992 , while a newer party , the Democratic Movement of Moz@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ que ( MD@@ M ) which was formed by a former Ren@@ amo member , is expected to improve its showing at the elections .
Mr Maz@@ anga says Mr G@@ u@@ e@@ b@@ u@@ za - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country 's democracy .
" He does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , " Mr Maz@@ anga said .
It is unclear how much capacity Ren@@ amo has , but it has carried out disrup@@ tive h@@ it-@@ and-@@ run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-@@ south highway .
Most of the s@@ k@@ i@@ r@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ hes have taken place in Sof@@ ala province , which is several hundred kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ es north of M@@ a@@ p@@ u@@ to , but hosts B@@ e@@ ira , the port that miners , including Rio Tinto and Vale , rely on to export coal .
In June , Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Ren@@ amo threatened to attack the line .
Mr Maz@@ anga was c@@ o@@ y when asked about whether Ren@@ amo would repeat this threat .
Ren@@ amo wanted to " warn the international community that things were not going well in Moz@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ que , " Mr Maz@@ anga said .
The instability has added to frustr@@ ations with the government , says Fernando Lim@@ a , head of M@@ e@@ d@@ i@@ a@@ c@@ o@@ o@@ p , an independent media company , with many people also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kid@@ napp@@ ings .
" People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems , " he says .
Omar S@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ u@@ ane , a demonstr@@ ator , said people just wanted stability .
" No one cares about Ren@@ amo and Fre@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o , they just want peace again , they want free access to the roads , " he said .
Children should be taught my@@ ths and legends as " models for a way of life , " author says .

Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necess@@ ity for some sense of hope .

N@@ SA Sp@@ ying : The United States " went too far , " Kerry admits
The United States sometimes went " too far " with its espi@@ onage activities , Secretary of State John Kerry recogn@@ ised in the first admission from Washington , which is deep in controversy with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) .
After ten days of scandal , revelations and den@@ ials between the United States and its European allies , this is the first time that an official of the American government has explic@@ itly admitted controversial activities in the N@@ SA 's interception of communications and data in Europe .
" In certain cases , I acknowledge , as does the President , that some of these activities went too far and we guarantee that this will not happen in the future , " declared John Kerry at a conference in London that he was participating in from Washington via a video link on Thursday October 31 .
In his r@@ e@@ l@@ ayed speech , and in the presence of his British counterpart , William H@@ ague , the head of the American diplomatic service justified at length the intelligence practices and collection of data as part of the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks .
Citing the attacks of 11 September 2001 , the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005 , John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since t@@ h@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ ted numerous planned attacks thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of data .
" We have prevented planes being brought down , buildings being blown up and people being mur@@ dered , because we have been able to stay informed prior to these attacks , " the head of the American diplomatic service argued .
Fur@@ thermore , John Kerry stated in his address to the E@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ ans , " I assure you that no innocent person has been misled during this process . "
Yet America stri@@ ves to c@@ o@@ l@@ l@@ ate data .
" Yes , in certain cases , this went too far in an inappropriate manner , " the Secretary of State again admitted , having already had to make a statement on the international scandal during a tour in Paris , London and Rome last week .
On Thursday evening , he asserted that President Obama had " resolved to try to clarify the matter and had initi@@ ated a r@@ e@@ -@@ examination of these practices to ensure that no-@@ one felt misled . "
But the controversy between the Americans and E@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ ans continued to grow this week with new revelations in the press .
According to the Washington Post , the N@@ SA has been intercep@@ ting data of hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users .
The newspaper , which q@@ u@@ o@@ tes documents obtained by the former N@@ SA consultant , Edward S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den , stated that the programme dubbed " M@@ US@@ C@@ U@@ L@@ A@@ R " and conducted in conjunction with the British counterpart of the N@@ SA , the G@@ CH@@ Q , enab@@ led the two agencies to gather data from the f@@ i@@ b@@ r@@ e@@ -@@ o@@ p@@ tic cables used by Internet giants .
According to one of the documents , some 1@@ 8@@ 1 million items were collected during the month of January alone - ranging from m@@ e@@ t@@ a data on e@@ m@@ ails to text elements or audio and video files .
These intercep@@ tions apparently took place outside the USA .
However , Yahoo and Google have denied any involvement in these practices .
For ten days now , a number of major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain and Italy have been revealing that the N@@ SA had intercep@@ ted massive quantities of data and communications emanating from allies of the United States and their leaders , in particular the German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Following the outrage of the European states , and even though l@@ e@@ aks to the American press stated that the American President was not up-to-@@ date with these s@@ p@@ ying activities , Barack Obama has refused to comment on the matter , citing national security .
On the other hand , the head of the powerful N@@ SA , General Keith Alexander , denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He even pointed the finger back at the European intelligence services who allegedly got hold of these communications before passing them on to the N@@ SA .
This concerned " military operations " in countries where the NATO allies are c@@ o@@ operating with the United States and this absolutely did not target Europe , according to General Alexander .
The d@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ ord spread to Asia on Friday .
Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espi@@ onage network , which has also a@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ sed the ire of China .
Paris S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ G@@ e@@ r@@ main will face L@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ ent on Friday without its t@@ r@@ ump card , the Swe@@ de Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic , who is suffering from an injury , the Lig@@ ue 1 club announced in a press release .
P@@ SG , who are top of the league ahead of Monaco on goal difference , issued the team sheet for the match , which is the 12th of the season , on which the 3@@ 2-year-old striker did not appear .
The press release said only that he is " injured , " without saying what the injury was .
However , he was suffering from an infl@@ a@@ m@@ m@@ ation on the left knee following his return from international duty this month .
Cer@@ e@@ m@@ ony in Mem@@ ory of the C@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ated
The P@@ è@@ re Lach@@ aise cremat@@ orium is organizing a lay ceremony at 11@@ am in memory of all those c@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ated at the establishment this year .
Anne Hid@@ a@@ l@@ go , socialist candidate for Paris may@@ orship , is expected to attend and will later explain her proposals on f@@ u@@ n@@ e@@ r@@ ary matters at a press conference .

More and more French people are choosing c@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ation for their own funerals rather than i@@ n@@ h@@ u@@ m@@ ation - 53 % against 47 % , according to an I@@ p@@ s@@ o@@ s survey carried out on September 6 and 7 among 1@@ ,@@ 009 people .
It is the opposite for the funeral of a loved one - the French prefer i@@ n@@ h@@ u@@ m@@ ation ( 53 % against 47 % ) .
Only 15 % of those who lose a child choose c@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ation .
In his book , La M@@ ort en C@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ res , Dam@@ i@@ en Le G@@ u@@ ay , phil@@ os@@ o@@ p@@ her and vice-@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ person of the C@@ o@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ é National d '@@ E@@ t@@ h@@ i@@ que du Fun@@ é@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ re emph@@ a@@ s@@ ises the " violence " that c@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ation represents for those left behind .
With c@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ation , there is a sense of " violence committed against the body of a loved one , " which will be " reduced to a pile of ashes " in a very short time instead of after a process of d@@ e@@ composition that " would accompany the stages of grief . "
There is also a " symbolic violence " that r@@ e@@ l@@ ates to the " obli@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ation of the person 's s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ u@@ l@@ a@@ r@@ ity and of distinctive sym@@ b@@ ols , " which are reduced to the " anonymity " of ashes .
Why is this accepted without difficulty in certain N@@ o@@ r@@ dic and p@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ant countries , but is still taken bad@@ ly in France ?
" Because c@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ation is a recent development , " says Mari@@ e@@ -@@ F@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ é@@ r@@ i@@ que B@@ a@@ c@@ q@@ u@@ é , president of the Than@@ a@@ t@@ ological Society and author of the book Ap@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ s@@ er la M@@ ort .
The Catholic Church only started tol@@ e@@ r@@ ating it in 1963 , a fact that has restric@@ ted efforts at getting to gri@@ ps with it .
For F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ç@@ ois M@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ d@@ -@@ N@@ é@@ r@@ ard , director general of Fun@@ e@@ r@@ ary Services for the City of Paris , getting to gri@@ ps with c@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ation is about giving the dec@@ eased a ceremony as d@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ fied as it would have been with an i@@ n@@ h@@ u@@ m@@ ation .
The annual I@@ p@@ s@@ o@@ s survey shows the strength of a@@ t@@ t@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ ment to the arrangement of the ceremony .
77 % of French want one for their loved ones , be it religious ( 53 % ) or civil ( 24 % ) .
Now@@ a@@ d@@ ays , 73 % of people choosing c@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ation want a ceremony to be arranged .
66 % of athe@@ ists or non-@@ believ@@ ers also want one .
Cre@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ oria have adapted to this change in society .
" For a decade or so , they have been trying hard to spare families from the feeling of violence in waiting for an hour and a half , doing nothing , followed immediately by their being handed the ashes , " observ@@ es M@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ d@@ -@@ N@@ é@@ r@@ ard .
70 % of e@@ s@@ t@@ abli@@ s@@ h@@ ments now offer a master of ceremonies to conduct the following ritu@@ al in the presence of the body : greet the cong@@ r@@ e@@ g@@ ation , mention the dec@@ eased by name , connect the dec@@ eased to those present , evo@@ ke who the person was , give sense to their death , o@@ r@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ ise a fare@@ well .
This is what has been happening at the P@@ è@@ re Lach@@ aise cremat@@ orium since 1998 .
The masters of ceremonies are often people who have moved into this new type of employment .
There are also former Catholic priests .
It is in this context that , since 2010 , the P@@ è@@ re Lach@@ aise cremat@@ orium has been o@@ r@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ ing a number of memorial ceremonies , lay and non-@@ religious , on All Saints Day , to which it i@@ n@@ v@@ ites the families of all those who have been c@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ ated during the course of the year .
For the second consecutive year , one of these ceremonies has been r@@ e@@ l@@ ayed online , for those could not attend .

R@@ e@@ housing Due to R@@ ats Cau@@ ses Stri@@ fe in La S@@ e@@ y@@ ne
At the start of this week , a family abandoned its ground floor apartment in building Fru@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ d@@ or D@@ 2 because of the presence of rats .
In view of the urgency of the situation , the director of the Ter@@ res du S@@ u@@ d Hab@@ i@@ t@@ at office offered to provide excep@@ tional , provisional r@@ e@@ housing for the couple and their three children in a new four-@@ room house .
However , the family refused " for financial reasons " and the situation is at stal@@ e@@ m@@ ate .
" The matter has become exagger@@ ated , " thinks J@@ o@@ ë@@ l C@@ a@@ n@@ a@@ p@@ a , office director .
" There have always been rats in towns .
The rat e@@ x@@ termination company conducts two operations per year . Fur@@ thermore , we interven@@ e at our own cost whenever there is a complaint from residents .
H@@ ence we have carried out 64 operations since last winter .
The area has not been abandoned and rats are not s@@ warming into the town .
Due to environmental protection and public health concerns , rat e@@ x@@ termination products are four times less efficient than in the past , but we are not going to kill a kid for the sake of two rats . "
" We didn 't invite the rats in , " counters the father of the family , which left its home and moved into a hotel .
" We will soon be p@@ e@@ n@@ n@@ i@@ l@@ ess and we are waiting for a new house at the same rate as the old one . "
News : Tokyo Stock Exchange Clo@@ ses 0.88 % Down
The Tokyo stock exchange was down at closing time on Friday , in spite of good manufacturing figures from China .
The list suffered as a result of the decline of the dollar against the yen , which is harmful to export values , and of the annual profit warning issued by Sony on Thursday .
The Nikke@@ i index dropped 12@@ 6.@@ 37 points ( 0.88 % ) to 14,@@ 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ .@@ 57 and the Top@@ ix was 11.@@ 23 points ( 0@@ .@@ 94 % ) down , at 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 8@@ 3@@ .@@ 03 .

House Eng@@ u@@ l@@ fed in F@@ l@@ a@@ m@@ es in Old Quebec
A fire that started at midday on Friday in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control .
More than thir@@ ty f@@ i@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ en rushed to 9 Rue H@@ é@@ bert .
The fire started in a three-@@ apartment house on four floors , situated behind the yard of the Quebec Sem@@ i@@ n@@ ary .
All the tenants were out when the fire started .
The fire was brought under control an hour after the f@@ i@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ en who arrived in their numbers to interven@@ e .
As soon as the first f@@ i@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ en arrived , they could clearly see the smoke .
" The alarms went off one after the other as it took rein@@ forc@@ ements to deal with the building , because the buildings here are close together , " explained France L@@ o@@ iselle , spokesperson for the Quebec fire service .
An investigation is under way to find the cause of the fire .
Ben Green@@ man : The Tent@@ h Anni@@ versary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Y@@ o@@ r@@ ker
One could argue that New York City is the birth@@ place of s@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ up comedy in America : nearly a hundred years ago , the vaudev@@ illian Frank F@@ ay , who served as the master of ceremonies at the P@@ a@@ l@@ ace Theatre , on Broadway , started telling jokes directly to the crowd , in a convers@@ ational manner .
F@@ ay 's innovation has been extended through the years , most recently by the New York Comedy Festival .
Cre@@ ated and overseen by Caroline Hir@@ sch , the founder of the s@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ up institution Carol@@ ines , the festival celebr@@ ates its tent@@ h anniversary this year , with more than six@@ ty shows at small clubs and large t@@ h@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ es .
" Most of these head@@ liners appeared at Carol@@ ines , and went on to greater success , to the point where they 're too big to play a club , " Hir@@ sch said .
We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them .
This year 's event includes appearances by W@@ anda S@@ y@@ kes , Kath@@ y Griff@@ in , and Bill Maher , as well as " S@@ t@@ and Up for Heroes , " an annual m@@ u@@ s@@ ic-@@ and-@@ comedy benefit for military veterans , at Madison Square Garden , featuring , among others , Bruce Springsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters , and Bill Cosby .
As the festival has expanded , so has the world of comedy .
Several of the come@@ d@@ i@@ ans participating in this year 's festival came up through non@@ traditional channels , such as shows on smaller networks , like Comedy Central , FX , and S@@ p@@ i@@ ke .
Nick Kr@@ oll rose to prominence on a deep-@@ cable sitcom ( FX@@ X 's gle@@ efully r@@ a@@ u@@ n@@ chy fantas@@ y@@ -@@ foot@@ b@@ all-@@ themed " The League " ) and now has his own Comedy Central s@@ k@@ e@@ t@@ ch show .
Jenny S@@ late has been a cast member on both " Saturday Night Live " and " Parks and Rec@@ r@@ e@@ ation , " though she is best known for her viral video series " Marc@@ el the Shell with Sho@@ es On . "
Both Kr@@ oll and S@@ late , as well as other young come@@ d@@ i@@ ans with distinctive voices ( the s@@ u@@ r@@ really pessimis@@ tic Anthony J@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ nik , the w@@ ry , r@@ a@@ c@@ i@@ ally f@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sed W. Kam@@ au Bell ) , are products of the d@@ e@@ centr@@ alized world of American comedy .
One of the festival 's biggest draws will be an interview : David Stein@@ berg talking to Larry David .
Stein@@ berg started as a s@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ up come@@ dian but has become an accomplished television and film director , as well as an unofficial comedy historian .
From 2005 to 2007 , he hosted a show on TV Land called " Sit Down Comedy with David Stein@@ berg . "
The meeting takes place at Town Hall , in the center of Manhattan .
" The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry 's work , " Stein@@ berg said .
He was telling me that , when he 's here , sometimes he 'll walk down an a@@ l@@ ley between two buildings and think to himself , H@@ ey , if I lose all my money , maybe I 'll live here .
Oil extends drop toward $ 96 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns over high supplies offset a report showing China 's power-@@ hungry manufacturing sector is s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ t@@ h@@ ening .
B@@ e@@ n@@ chmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $ 9@@ 6.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday , leaving it down 5.8 percent for the month of October .
A@@ m@@ ple supplies of crude have weighed on the price in recent weeks .
The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased 4.@@ 1 million barrels last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have risen by more than 25 million barrels .
But a suggestion of stronger demand came Friday from two reports on Chinese manufacturing that showed an uptick in activity .
That suggests China 's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7@@ .@@ 8 percent in the third quarter from a two-@@ decade low in the previous quarter .
Brent crude , a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refin@@ eries , fell 26 cents to $ 1@@ 0@@ 8.@@ 58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London .
Abortion Law in Texas Chall@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ed
A federal appeal court in Texas has r@@ e@@ introduced certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy , which had been blocked by a trial judge this week .
The decision means that a legal text adopted in the state in July generally challenging the right to abortion will be able to come into force .
The decision by the court of appeal means that doctors who p@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ se abortion will need to have an " admitting privilege " with local hospitals .
An admitting privilege is the right of a doctor to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre to carry out a diagno@@ sis or a procedure , based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital .
Def@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ers of abortion stress that the content of the law may lead to the immediate closure of a third of clin@@ ics in the state , as these clin@@ ics have failed to obtain the admitting privilege for their p@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ tioners .
In all , nearly 22,000 women will be deprived of access to such e@@ s@@ t@@ abli@@ s@@ h@@ ments .
On Monday , the day before the law was due to come into force , a trial judge considered that the provisions p@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ing to admitting privil@@ eges were unconstitutional .
But the Attorney General for Texas , Republican Greg Abbot@@ t , who is c@@ a@@ n@@ v@@ assing for the role of governor , asked the court of appeal to overturn the judgement from the trial court blocking the application of the law .
A p@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ ary hearing on the matter is scheduled to take place in January .
" La N@@ o@@ u@@ v@@ elle Star " made a big comeback in terms of audiences , with 1.3 million TV viewers , that is a 5.@@ 6 % share of the viewing audience .
But was the show up to expectations ?
Some 10,000 candidates turned up at the a@@ u@@ d@@ i@@ tions to face the jury for this 10th season : Maur@@ ane , the n@@ augh@@ ty S@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ l@@ air , the high-@@ pitched André M@@ a@@ n@@ o@@ u@@ k@@ ian and Olivier B@@ as .
The viewers shared their thoughts on Tw@@ itter .
The excitement of finding their favorite programme having s@@ u@@ b@@ sided , many are disappointed .
But why where they so disappointed ?
None of the c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ants seem to have really stood out at first g@@ l@@ ance .
As every year , the first a@@ u@@ dition shows threw in a wide variety of bud@@ ding s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers into the mix , sometimes for the best and sometimes not .
But , on Tw@@ itter , people want a spectacle , emo@@ tion , origin@@ ality , music ...
Fort@@ u@@ n@@ ately , a few got just that .
Many people have tried " La N@@ o@@ u@@ v@@ elle Star , " and some have even gotten through .
Behind the television screens , there are always those cut out to be successful s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers , season after season .
Others are just out to make you laugh .
Court blocks ruling on NY@@ PD stop@@ -and-@@ f@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ k policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge 's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department 's stop@@ -and-@@ f@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ k program and removed the judge from the case .
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge S@@ h@@ ira Sche@@ i@@ n@@ d@@ lin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city .
The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people .
The city appealed her findings and her r@@ e@@ medi@@ al orders , including a decision to assi@@ gn a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it .
The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay .
The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran a@@ f@@ o@@ u@@ l of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ m@@ ising the necess@@ ity for a judge to avoid the appearance of p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court .
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrong@@ ly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop@@ -and-@@ f@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ k program .
She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes , including reforms in policies , training and supervision , and she ordered a pilot program to test bod@@ y@@ -@@ worn cameras in some precin@@ c@@ ts where most stops occur .
In August , New York City agreed to end the practice of stor@@ ing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop .
An oral argument on the city 's appeal is scheduled for s@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ time after March 14 , 2014 .
The stop@@ -and-@@ f@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ k tacti@@ c has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates .
S@@ t@@ o@@ p@@ -and-@@ f@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ k has been around for decades in some form , but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 68@@ 4,3@@ 30 , mostly of black and Hispanic men .
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men , all minorities , and became a class action case .
Sup@@ porters of changes to the NY@@ PD 's stop@@ -and-@@ f@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ k program say the changes will end unfair practices , will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy .
Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime , waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade .
The judge noted she wasn 't putting an end to the stop@@ -and-@@ f@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ k practice , which is constitutional , but was r@@ e@@ forming the way the NY@@ PD implemented its stops .
Ten@@ ants have to go and vote , as each of them pays an average of $ 100 a month in the cost of their accommod@@ ation that goes to the City in taxes .
If the owner pays $ 5000 in municipal taxes , he d@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ des this figure between each house .
We are forced to increase the rent to help us pay the new taxes .
By going to vote , we are sending a clear message .
We need to change things in the city .
All the candidates have told us that they would tackle this scand@@ alous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay $ 100,000 for fireworks , $ 4-@@ 5 million for land just in case ...
Go and vote , that is the best way to express yourself and say enough is enough .
End of the Road for E@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ é@@ e Head Che@@ f
Having entered the 500@@ m@@ 2@@ -@@ space of the kit@@ chens at the E@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ é@@ e P@@ a@@ l@@ ace as an assistant after working in e@@ m@@ b@@ assi@@ es , the cook climbed up the lad@@ der to become head chef nine years ago .
He has served six French presidents , from Georges Pom@@ p@@ i@@ d@@ o@@ u to Nicolas Sarkozy and F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ç@@ ois Holl@@ a@@ n@@ de , including at their holiday homes , and fed an u@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ table number of world figures , surrounded by a cloud of anonymity that he has only emerged from today , as he r@@ e@@ t@@ i@@ res at 60 .
Born on 24 October 1@@ 9@@ 53 in La F@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ é@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ A@@ u@@ bin , the man with an open face , a b@@ a@@ l@@ ding head and the glasses of an intellectual is the holder of a certi@@ ficate of professional compe@@ tence in c@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ ery .
His mother was a cook in a c@@ h@@ â@@ t@@ e@@ au in S@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ ne .
" I 've moved from one c@@ h@@ â@@ t@@ e@@ au to another ! " says Bernard V@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ sion iron@@ ically . He is familiar , not only with the habits of the six presidents for whom he has c@@ o@@ o@@ ked , but also with those of their wives and some of their i@@ l@@ l@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ ous guests .
" It 's always the Head of State or his partner or wife who choo@@ ses the menu , " he recalls .
" Mad@@ ame C@@ h@@ i@@ r@@ ac was a little more involved and would come right into the kitchen , " to the point where she f@@ o@@ r@@ b@@ ade women to enter the kit@@ chens in the E@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ é@@ e P@@ a@@ l@@ ace !
With all due respect to heads of state who appeared relatively i@@ n@@ different to fruits of the earth , " they are all fond of food " Bernard V@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ sion reveals g@@ r@@ aci@@ ously .
Jacques C@@ h@@ i@@ r@@ ac certainly had a " more refin@@ ed palate . "
But with Nicolas Sarkozy , who f@@ o@@ r@@ b@@ ade cheese , the p@@ l@@ ates always came back empty !
F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ç@@ ois Holl@@ a@@ n@@ de , who r@@ e@@ introduced cheese , is " a man who likes to eat " and " he is not very choo@@ sy . "
The current Head of State , who has put back on the pounds he lost during the presidential campaign , does " not have a specific diet requirement . "
Bernard V@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ sion also recalls the pressure that would rest on his shoulders , especially during state din@@ ners at the E@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ é@@ e , where one had to serve " between 200 and 250 people in around an hour . "
The night before would be prac@@ tically s@@ l@@ e@@ e@@ pless .
Such people would not understand if something went wrong .
The now former head chef at the E@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ é@@ e , who shared a drink on Tuesday evening with his team , his family and friends , is leaving with a t@@ w@@ inge of sorrow . " F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ç@@ ois Holl@@ a@@ n@@ de came to say goodbye . "
He was full of praise .
" His human side came out , " he recalls .
The chef will be replaced by his assistant , 35-@@ year-old Guillaume Gomez , who has been at the E@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ é@@ e for s@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ een years himself .
Fire in 1@@ 8@@ 50 Quebec House
A historic house built in 1@@ 8@@ 50 in Old Quebec was engulfed in flames on Friday at lun@@ c@@ h@@ time .
The four-@@ apartment building located at 15 Rue H@@ é@@ bert set off three alarms at the fire department .
The fire started at the front , but spread to all three floors of the building .
France Vo@@ iselle , spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service , said that the quick intervention of the fire b@@ r@@ i@@ g@@ ade prevented the fire spreading to adjacent buildings , a major challenge in this part of town where the buildings are very close together .
The building damaged by the fire contained four a@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ ments , but there was nobody at home when the fire started .
The damage was fairly limited all in all , although the water caused some harm .
An investigation will be conducted to determine the cause , although the fire b@@ r@@ i@@ g@@ ade has ruled out the possibility of it being a criminal act .

F@@ o@@ r@@ g@@ et being sensible and grab your ticket .
L@@ e@@ o@@ n@@ ardo D@@ i@@ Ca@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ o will take your breath away in his role as a crazy trad@@ er .
Martin Scor@@ s@@ ese tells us a true story about a " Long Island stock@@ broker who refuses to collaborate with the authorities over a massive corruption scheme on Wall Street . "
In the 1980s , Jordan Bel@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ t embar@@ ks on a scam that would make him a very rich man .
We see his m@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ oric rise , but also the v@@ e@@ r@@ tig@@ i@@ n@@ ous fall that follows .

The new Scor@@ s@@ ese release is late because the editing has taken longer than planned .

Due in t@@ h@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ es December 25 , its release will come just right in time for the Osc@@ ars .
Coul@@ son used phone hacking to v@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ fy tip
Former News of the World editor Andy Coul@@ son allegedly used " phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation " in an attempt to confirm a b@@ o@@ g@@ us tip about an affair involving then-@@ home secretary Charles C@@ l@@ a@@ r@@ ke .
Prosecu@@ tor Andrew Ed@@ is QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that C@@ l@@ a@@ r@@ ke was seeing his " attractive special adviser , " Hannah P@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ by .
The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn M@@ u@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ re with hacking P@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ by 's voic@@ e@@ m@@ ails and " d@@ o@@ or-@@ stepped " her , but Coul@@ son also called and left her voic@@ e@@ m@@ ails , the court heard .
" The prosecution suggests that Mr Coul@@ son , who is now the editor of the N@@ o@@ t@@ W , he is not the man who stands outside people 's houses hoping to catch them out , he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say , " Mr Ed@@ is said .
He said the N@@ o@@ t@@ W used three ways to investigate stories : phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .
The editor is personally involved in the third .
Obviously he knows about the second , surveillance , he must do .
What about the first ?
Does he know about phone hacking ?
He says he doesn 't , we say " Oh yes , he did . "
Rum@@ ours about an affair involving C@@ l@@ a@@ r@@ ke were first picked up by the N@@ o@@ t@@ W 's features desk when a source who was sexu@@ ally interested in Ms P@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ by was told : " Don 't bother wasting your time , she 's with Charles . "
A tape of voic@@ e@@ m@@ ails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from M@@ u@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ re 's home in August 2006 .
Investigators also found entries on the private investigator 's computer which had Ms P@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ by and her sister as " Projects . "
During the period she was being investig@@ ated , Ms P@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ by 's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her , Mr Ed@@ is said .
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Nev@@ ille T@@ h@@ u@@ r@@ l@@ b@@ e@@ ck and former reporter James Weather@@ up overs@@ aw surveillance of Ms P@@ a@@ w@@ l@@ by 's movements .
L@@ e@@ a@@ v@@ ing her a voic@@ email on June 18 2005 , Coul@@ son told her : " I 've got a story that we 're planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about . "
Mr Ed@@ is said Coul@@ son 's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former home secretary David B@@ l@@ u@@ n@@ ket@@ t .
The jury heard on Thursday that Coul@@ son c@@ o@@ n@@ fron@@ ted Mr B@@ l@@ u@@ n@@ ket@@ t over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-@@ defendant R@@ e@@ b@@ e@@ k@@ ah Broo@@ ks , who was married at the time .
Coul@@ son and Broo@@ ks deny c@@ o@@ n@@ spir@@ ing with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006 .
M@@ u@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ re , T@@ h@@ u@@ r@@ l@@ b@@ e@@ ck and Weather@@ up have admitted phone hacking .
Barack Obama to Meet Iraqi Prime Minister as Vi@@ o@@ l@@ ence R@@ ages
The American President will receive the Iraqi Prime Minister , N@@ ouri Al Maliki , who is seeking the United States ' help in the struggle against the strong@@ est wave of violence in five years , on 1 November 2@@ 0@@ 13 , .
October was the bloo@@ diest month in Iraq in five and a half years , according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday , 01 November .
9@@ 64 people ( of which 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 policemen and 44 soldiers ) were killed in acts of violence during October and 1,600 people were injured .
The UN has reported even higher numbers with 979 dead and 1,9@@ 02 injured .
The violence is becoming more and more deadly in spite of reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations undertaken in recent months by N@@ ouri Al Maliki 's government , which is dominated by Shi@@ ites .
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008 , when 1,0@@ 73 people were killed .
About two years after the withdrawal of American troops , the level of violence brings renewed fears of unrest while the country 's neighbor , Syria , is in the grip of civil war .
Bomb@@ s strike markets , mos@@ ques , wed@@ dings and funeral ceremonies .
People are attacked in the street and even at home , and the security forces are also frequent targets of the attacks .
The growing discontent among the Sunni minority , which held power under Saddam Hussein and is now complaining of being politically margin@@ alized and being the target of unjust arrests , has favored this outburst of violence .
On Friday , the latest acts of violence left four people dead in the north of Iraq , a day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks , which included five b@@ o@@ o@@ by-@@ trapped cars being blown up in the north of Baghdad .
The majority of the violence is attributed to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Lev@@ ant ( E@@ I@@ I@@ L ) , a group affili@@ ated with Al-@@ Qaida ( Sunni extremists ) , which is also involved in the civil war in Syria .
N@@ ouri Al Maliki wants a " global war " against Al-@@ Qaida .
The violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States with Prime Minister N@@ ouri Al Maliki , who will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday , two years after their last meeting on 12 December 2011 .
At that time , the American President , who was elected on the promise of bringing to an end the US ' military involvement in the country , painted an optimistic picture of the situation .
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday , N@@ ouri Al Maliki has met several government officials and members of Congress .
On Thursday , he pleaded that the international community should conduct a " third world war " against Al-@@ Qaida .
The principle of security aid for Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators .
However , they have also criticized Shiite N@@ ouri Al Maliki , saying he is partly responsible for the r@@ e@@ s@@ u@@ m@@ ption of violence because of his " sectarian and author@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ an policies . "
They have also demanded that Barack Obama make N@@ ouri Al Maliki understand that " the p@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ous influence of Iran within the Iraqi government constitu@@ tes a serious problem in the relationship between our two countries . "
Beijing Acc@@ uses U@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ur Group of Ti@@ a@@ n@@ a@@ n@@ men Attack
The head of internal security in China accused a group of U@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ur separ@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ sts from X@@ i@@ n@@ j@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ g on Friday of being behind the car bomb attack in Ti@@ a@@ n@@ a@@ n@@ men Square in the centre of Beijing on Monday , which left five people dead .
The vehicle , an SUV , raced towards the crowd in the famous square in the Chinese capital , the symbol of the bloody 1989 s@@ u@@ p@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ sion , before c@@ a@@ t@@ ching fire , killing its three occupants and two p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ -@@ by .
Men@@ g J@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ z@@ h@@ u , a member of the p@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ t@@ b@@ u@@ r@@ o in charge of internal security issues , accused the East Turk@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ an Islamic Movement of i@@ n@@ stig@@ ating the attack .
Num@@ erous U@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ u@@ r@@ s , a Turk@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ -@@ speaking minority in X@@ i@@ n@@ j@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ g , call this Chinese province East Turk@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ an .
The Chinese government believes the movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence in the province , spar@@ ked by demands for independence .
" The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and p@@ r@@ e@@ med@@ itated , " said Men@@ g on Hong Kong television channel Phoenix TV .
" The group hiding behind the scenes was the East Turk@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ an Islamic Movement , " he added , his words being r@@ e@@ l@@ ayed by the Xinhua News Agency .
The Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle , whose name suggests he is of U@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ur origin , and stated that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The vehicle also held c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ers full of petrol and a flag with orthodo@@ x religious writing on it .
The incident left 42 people injured .
The East Turk@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ an Islamic Movement is considered by the United States and the United Nations to be a terrorist organization .
Vatican Poll on C@@ o@@ n@@ trac@@ e@@ p@@ tion , D@@ i@@ v@@ o@@ r@@ ce and Hom@@ o@@ sexuality
The Vatican is to carry out a large-scale poll across the world on the way in which p@@ a@@ r@@ ishes handle sensitive issues such as contrac@@ e@@ p@@ tion , divor@@ ces and same-sex couples .
The poll will ask participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children , and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage bonds .
The poll was sent out to every national conference of bishops in mid-@@ October , with instructions to secure as many responses as possible .
The information will be used at a major assembly on the family that Pope Francis is planning to organize next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter , an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States .
A spokesperson for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authenti@@ c and that each bis@@ hop would decide on the appropriate way in which to approach p@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ i@@ oners .
In the United Kingdom , bishops have published the poll on the Internet and asked Cath@@ olic@@ s to participate .
DRC : Army Att@@ acks Last R@@ e@@ bel S@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ h@@ old
The d@@ i@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ ds of the M@@ 23 , who are several hundreds in number , had entrenched themselves at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres in the farm@@ land hills of Chan@@ z@@ u , Run@@ y@@ o@@ n@@ y@@ i and M@@ b@@ u@@ z@@ i , close to Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana and J@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ a , two towns located around 80@@ km north of G@@ oma , the capital of North K@@ i@@ v@@ u province .
" The fighting has not stopped since morning and is continuing despite the darkness , " a resident of J@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ a , according to whom a little girl had been injured by gunfire in the morning , told the AFP by telephone at around 12.@@ 30@@ pm .
" The fighting has slightly reduced in intensity . It appears that the Armed Forces of the DRC ( F@@ A@@ R@@ DC ) have pushed the rebels back a bit , " he added .
According to this witness , who chose to remain anonymous , the soldiers had " spent the night " in J@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ a , before going into action for a " c@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ ing operation . "
The rattle of gunfire from light arms could clearly be heard in the background .
From Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana , a political s@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ h@@ old and last preserve of the rebellion to fall on Wednesday , an AFP journalist could hear the detonation of heavy arms .
According to a source at the United Nations S@@ t@@ a@@ b@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ zation Mission in the DRC ( MON@@ US@@ CO ) , the fighting has entered " the final phase " : the F@@ A@@ R@@ DC has " surrounded the remaining M@@ 23 positions to flush them out . "
Since the r@@ e@@ s@@ u@@ m@@ ption on Friday of confront@@ ations between the March 23 Movement ( M@@ 23 ) and the army , MON@@ US@@ CO has not been participating directly in the fighting , but it is providing government 's troops with critical support in terms of intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , several dozen well-@@ equipped soldiers headed off towards the front .
They were armed with K@@ a@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ h@@ n@@ i@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ s and rocket laun@@ chers .
A little earlier , on the road to Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana , the frontier post with Uganda , soldiers assisted by civilians loaded up a multiple rocket laun@@ cher mounted on a brand new truck belonging to the F@@ A@@ R@@ DC , intended to take over from another device pounding the positions of the M@@ 23 in the hills .
The C@@ o@@ n@@ gol@@ ese President , Joseph Kab@@ ila , called on the rebels once again on Wednesday to " stand down volun@@ tar@@ ily " or be d@@ i@@ s@@ armed " by force , " while leaving open the Kamp@@ ala process , where Kin@@ s@@ h@@ a@@ s@@ a and the M@@ 23 have been in discussions since December with no outcome as yet .
The political leaders of the M@@ 23 are hoping to reach an agreement there .
" We have finished the talks . The U@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ an medi@@ ators just need to organize the signing , " asserted Roger L@@ u@@ m@@ b@@ a@@ l@@ a , vice-president of the M@@ 23 delegation , although this information could not be confirmed immediately with the government .
The M@@ 23 was born of an April 2012 m@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ y by former rebels , p@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ally Tut@@ sis who were integrated into the army in 2009 following a peace agreement .
The UN and Kin@@ s@@ h@@ a@@ s@@ a regularly a@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ se Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M@@ 23 . K@@ i@@ g@@ ali and Kamp@@ ala have denied the accusations .
North K@@ i@@ v@@ u is one of the most dens@@ ely populated areas of the DRC , and its land a@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ ds in coveted m@@ i@@ n@@ eral resources .
At Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana , on the U@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ an side of the border , to which around 5,000 people fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN , the process of returning which started in the morning was reversed at midday .
" This morning we went back across the border to go back to our fields , but the soldiers told us to go back , " the AFP was told by Im@@ e@@ l@@ da Ny@@ i@@ r@@ ank@@ u@@ s@@ i , surrounded by her nine children , including an infant on her back .
The gunfire seems to be getting closer to the population .
Early that evening , dozens of residents were crossing the border , some with matt@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ ses on their heads , to spend the night in Uganda .
M@@ u@@ s@@ i@@ c@@ als , the Great P@@ e@@ r@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ces
Class@@ ical , sophisticated , popular , in English or in French , song and dance productions are starting to take off .
After Broadway and London , Paris is finally finding its voice .
It 's a revolution : the French musical is establishing itself as a successful genre .
For a long time , the majority of attempts , from ' N@@ o@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ -D@@ ame de Paris ' to ' Moz@@ art , l '@@ Op@@ é@@ r@@ a Rock ' , have been e@@ m@@ b@@ roiled in r@@ i@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ le .
And successful acts such as ' Cab@@ a@@ r@@ et ' or ' Les Mis@@ é@@ r@@ ables ' have had an air of mystery about them .
The arrival of J@@ e@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ L@@ u@@ c C@@ h@@ o@@ p@@ lin at the C@@ h@@ â@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ et and Stage Entertainment at the M@@ o@@ g@@ a@@ d@@ or has changed all that .
Today , these two stages are chur@@ ning out performances like hits .
The former is repris@@ ing its excellent ' My Fair Lady ' this Christmas and has announced the worldwide production of ' Un A@@ m@@ é@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ ain à Paris ' as a follow-up .
At the M@@ o@@ g@@ a@@ d@@ or , ' La B@@ elle et la B@@ ê@@ te ' could well be one of the successes of the season .
On other stages , m@@ u@@ s@@ i@@ c@@ als such as ' 1@@ 7@@ 89 : les Aman@@ ts de la Bas@@ t@@ i@@ l@@ le ' and small productions such as ' D@@ i@@ s@@ co ' or ' Life and Times ' are falling in step with the success and quality recorded so far .
Patrick Ni@@ e@@ d@@ o , author of the reference book ' H@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ ires de c@@ o@@ m@@ é@@ dies m@@ u@@ s@@ i@@ c@@ ales ' and speaker at the T@@ h@@ é@@ â@@ t@@ r@@ e du C@@ h@@ â@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ et , analyses the reasons for the hard-@@ won success .
How are French m@@ u@@ s@@ i@@ c@@ als evolving ?
The choice is growing .
F@@ i@@ r@@ s@@ t@@ ly there are the " musical shows " that evol@@ ve according to the will of the producers ...
Some use lovely projections of images and a true story , such as ' 1@@ 7@@ 89 : les Aman@@ ts de la Bas@@ t@@ i@@ l@@ le ' .
Others leap back@@ wards fif@@ teen years , under the p@@ r@@ e@@ text that you can put on pretty much whatever you want when you have Matt P@@ o@@ k@@ ora heading the bill .
Then there are the m@@ u@@ s@@ i@@ c@@ als with the s@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ u@@ ous productions of the C@@ h@@ â@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ et , which allow us to bring the gol@@ den age of Broadway back to life and r@@ e@@ discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim , the greatest composer alive .
Stage Entertainment p@@ o@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ zes variety English m@@ u@@ s@@ i@@ c@@ als by adapting them into French .
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough .
But projects under way such as ' R@@ ent ' , ' Le B@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ er de la F@@ e@@ m@@ me A@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ é@@ e ' or ' L '@@ É@@ veil du P@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ m@@ ps ' are having trouble finding finances .
Do we have enough artists capable of singing , acting and dancing , as on Broadway ?
In Paris , when there are eight m@@ u@@ s@@ i@@ c@@ als in a season , then it 's a good year .
We have 200 talented artists who move from project to project .
In the United States , the c@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ le of the musical , it is very different .
Young actors are trained in these skills in numerous schools .
There are numerous jobs in regional t@@ h@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ es , touring companies , Broadway , off Broadway e@@ t@@ c .
The breeding ground for talent is as sizable as the number of roles available .
Why are provincial tours so successful ?
With the exception of opera , the provinces remain the poor r@@ e@@ l@@ ative of culture in France .
Few theatr@@ ical productions go on tour and most of them are usually " b@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ e@@ v@@ ard theatre , " intended for adults , not a@@ d@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cents .
M@@ u@@ s@@ i@@ c@@ als fill that gap .
These are the same young people that love reality television and the e@@ p@@ h@@ e@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ al stars it produces ...
Off@@ ering goo@@ d@@ -@@ looking ( often talented ) young men a leading role in a musical guarantees the a@@ d@@ oration of young girls and often their entire family .
Facebook pages for these shows are s@@ k@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ fully managed by professionals who answer questions .
The shows are eagerly expected by the time they reach a provincial Z@@ é@@ n@@ ith ( theatre ) .
The m@@ u@@ s@@ i@@ c@@ als are prepared in Paris and enjoyed in the provinces .
The show is designed to be staged in any major theatre in France in the same format as in Paris .
One S@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ ously Injured in Ac@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ent with W@@ r@@ ong Way Driver on Brussels R@@ ing Road
A road accident on the Brussels inner ring road near H@@ o@@ e@@ i@@ l@@ a@@ art in the direction of Water@@ loo at 5.@@ 30@@ am on Friday morning left one person seriously injured .
The car driven by the injured woman was hit by a driver who was travelling in the wrong direction and came out u@@ n@@ hurt .
The section of the ring road where the accident occurred was closed to traffic until 9@@ am for the road to be cleared and for an expert to establish the circumstances of the accident .
This situation , however , did not create traffic j@@ am as the accident happened at the exit of H@@ o@@ e@@ i@@ l@@ a@@ art .
Traffic was therefore diver@@ ted via the exit / entrance to the ring road .
Child S@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ ously Injured on R@@ i@@ de at Disneyland Paris
A child aged five has been seriously injured following an accident on a ride at Disneyland Paris .
His life is not in danger but he is still in hospital .
The boy was with his father on the " Pirates of the Cari@@ b@@ beans " boat ride when he fell .
The ride has been closed t@@ i@@ l@@ l further notice .
DRC : Army P@@ r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ es New Ass@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t
Children play on a charred tank that belong@@ ed to M@@ 23 rebels , at Ki@@ bum@@ ba in the east of the DRC on 31 October 2@@ 0@@ 13 .
On Friday the C@@ o@@ n@@ gol@@ ese army was preparing a new assault on the final b@@ a@@ s@@ tions of the M@@ 23 rebels close to Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana in the east of the DRC .
The aim of the assault is to flush the M@@ 23 out of the hills overlooking Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana .
Yesterday , we took Bu@@ g@@ ina hill , which o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ looks M@@ b@@ u@@ z@@ i hill .
Today , M@@ b@@ u@@ z@@ i is expected to fall as well .
Then only Rum@@ y@@ oni hill will be left .
" Chan@@ z@@ u hill is not strategic , " the governor of North K@@ i@@ v@@ u , Juli@@ en P@@ a@@ l@@ uk@@ u , told the AFP .
Mr P@@ a@@ l@@ uk@@ u hopes to be in Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana on Saturday .
The town , which is a political s@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ h@@ old and the final b@@ a@@ s@@ tion of the rebellion , lies on the border with Uganda , around 80@@ km north of G@@ oma .
It was r@@ e@@ c@@ a@@ p@@ tured by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( F@@ A@@ R@@ DC ) on Wednesday .
Since then , several hundred M@@ 23 d@@ i@@ e@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ ds have been cut off in the farm@@ land hills of Chan@@ z@@ u , Run@@ y@@ o@@ n@@ y@@ i and M@@ b@@ u@@ z@@ i , close to Bun@@ a@@ g@@ ana and the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ ing town of J@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ a , at an altitude of almost 2,000 metres .
In J@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ a , a local contact who had reported fighting at close quarters throughout Thursday said that the situation had been " calm since this morning . "
He also said that a woman and child had been killed in fighting the previous evening and had been buried .
A little girl sustained injuries from gunfire , and three other people had been wounded . One of them was seriously hit and had been evacuated by the F@@ A@@ R@@ DC , the witness quoted by the AFP added .
Since the r@@ e@@ s@@ u@@ m@@ ption of h@@ o@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ties between the F@@ A@@ R@@ DC and the rebels on 25 October , the two sides have given no indication of the casualties .
N@@ SA revelations boost corporate p@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ o@@ ia about state surveillance
On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consul@@ ate in Frankfurt , the financial capital of Germany .
On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , Germany 's domestic intelligence agency , its mission was to photograph the roof@@ top of the US outpost , which is located less than 5@@ km from the European Central Bank and Bun@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ bank .
German media say the B@@ f@@ V hoped to identify the presence of listening a@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ n@@ as and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin .
James C@@ l@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ er , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities " to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competi@@ tiveness or increase their bottom line . "
But ever since Edward S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den , the contractor turned whist@@ leblower , began releasing his treasure t@@ r@@ o@@ ve of US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word .
Reports that the US National Security Agency spi@@ ed on Braz@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ an oil company Petr@@ o@@ b@@ r@@ as and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have r@@ a@@ t@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ t@@ ed corporate p@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ o@@ ia about state surveillance to new highs .
The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel 's phone had been b@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ed , possibly for about a decade .
If Europe 's most powerful person can be targeted , then s@@ u@@ rely business leaders are also potential targets .
S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den has made transparent the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies .
I think it 's conceivable that these data are used for mutual benefit .
" Germany must wake up , " says Oliver G@@ r@@ ü@@ n , president of B@@ IT@@ M@@ i , which represents small and medium sized German IT companies .
German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espi@@ onage and data theft , according to a survey published in July by E@@ Y , the consul@@ tancy .
In all the documentation leaked by Mr S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den , there has , however , been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies ' trade secrets to its own companies .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans have expressed concern that the EU l@@ acks certain IT and internet capabilities and should stri@@ ve to reduce its depend@@ ence on the US .
Business leaders are s@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tical about this .
Some@@ one in the German parliament says we should build a German Google .
I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again ...
" That 's not the way , " Hass@@ o P@@ l@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ ner , chairman of German business software company SAP , says .
If one wanted a strong European IT industry , then one shouldn 't have let it die out 20 years ago .
Everything is s@@ u@@ b@@ s@@ i@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ ed in Germany , from coal , to cars and farmers .
Everything but the IT industry .
Still , the reach and technical sophistic@@ ation of US spy agencies exposed by the S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China .
A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance , a trade body , some 10 per cent of non-@@ US members canc@@ elled plans to use a US@@ -based cloud provider after revelations about the US Pris@@ m data mining programme .
Jim Sn@@ abe , co-@@ chief executive at SAP , says : " We see a new question from customers that didn 't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction . "
Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs .
That economic s@@ p@@ ying takes place is not a surprise .
It has always taken place .
" This has been a topic for many years and hasn 't fundam@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ally changed through the current discussion , " says Kur@@ t B@@ ock , chief executive of chemical maker BAS@@ F .
The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the counter@@ measures they have taken , in case this hands an advantage to an attacker .
For large companies , the message has long since been d@@ r@@ u@@ m@@ med home that pic@@ king up a free USB stick at a trade fair , or leaving a lap@@ top u@@ n@@ guarded in a hotel room are u@@ n@@ wise , to say the least .
Ulrich H@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ enberg , board member at c@@ a@@ r@@ maker Audi , says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices .
Germany 's B@@ f@@ V advises executives to consider using simple p@@ r@@ e@@ paid mob@@ i@@ l@@ es when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised .
The p@@ r@@ e@@ paid mob@@ i@@ l@@ es are then thrown away afterwards .
However , there is concern that small and medi@@ um-@@ sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance .
In Germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular n@@ i@@ che .
" Sm@@ all and medium sized companies often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against u@@ n@@ author@@ ised access , " the B@@ f@@ V warns in a report .
The US warns its own companies about economic espi@@ onage by other countries .
The US National Intelligence E@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ mate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence , behind China , according to The Washington Post .
A board member at a German blue-@@ chip company c@@ o@@ n@@ c@@ u@@ r@@ red that when it comes to economic espi@@ onage , " the French are the worst . "
Bernard S@@ q@@ u@@ a@@ r@@ c@@ i@@ n@@ i , former head of the French internal intelligence agency D@@ C@@ R@@ I , was quoted in an interview this month as saying : " The services know perfectly well that all countries , even as they co-@@ operate in the a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ terrorist fight , spy on their allies . "
Parents of Georgia teen who died in ' f@@ r@@ e@@ ak accident ' believe son was mur@@ dered
The parents of a Georgia teenager , whose body was found inside a r@@ o@@ l@@ l@@ e@@ d-up wrest@@ ling m@@ at in his high school gy@@ m , believe their son was mur@@ dered , the family 's attorney said Thursday .
K@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ ick Johnson , of Val@@ d@@ o@@ sta , Ga . , was found Jan. 11 stuck in an u@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t m@@ at p@@ r@@ o@@ pped behind the ble@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ ers inside his high school gy@@ m .
Low@@ n@@ des County sheriff 's investigators concluded Johnson died in a f@@ r@@ e@@ ak accident , but the 17-year-old 's family dispu@@ tes that .
" They absolutely think their son was mur@@ dered , " Benjamin Cr@@ ump , an attorney representing K@@ e@@ n@@ n@@ eth and Jac@@ q@@ u@@ e@@ l@@ yn Johnson , told Fo@@ x@@ New@@ s.com .
They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded .
" They believe that it d@@ e@@ fies logi@@ c , the laws of phys@@ ics as well as common sense , " Cr@@ ump said .
They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son 's death .
" They sent their son to school with a book@@ -@@ b@@ ag and he was returned to them in a body bag , " he said .
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson 's death , noting that several key questions remain unanswered .
What was the cause of death ?
Was his death the result of a crime ?
Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon .
I will follow the facts wherever they lead .
My objective is to discovery the truth .
" I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists " for a formal investigation , he said .
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of " p@@ o@@ s@@ i@@ tional a@@ s@@ phy@@ x@@ ia . "
A second autopsy , however , listed a different cause of death , according to Moore .
" There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed , " he said .
Moore added that if he u@@ n@@ covers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it .
A representative from the Low@@ n@@ des County Sheriff 's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday .
A southern Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance video that investigators reviewed .
The teenager 's parents said they hope the video foot@@ age will contain clues to how he died .
CDC issues children 's allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children 's food aller@@ gies at school .
This is the first set of such guidelines the U.S. government has put out , as the number of school@@ -@@ age children suffering from food aller@@ gies clim@@ bs .
One in 20 children in the United States now have food aller@@ gies .
The CDC found the prevalence of food aller@@ gies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children 's food aller@@ gies , and how to handle them should an aller@@ g@@ i@@ c reaction occur .
It also recomm@@ ends schools have e@@ p@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ p@@ h@@ r@@ ine stoc@@ ked -- the Epi@@ Pen brand a@@ u@@ to-@@ i@@ n@@ j@@ e@@ ctor being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal a@@ n@@ a@@ p@@ hy@@ l@@ a@@ x@@ is .
State l@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ l@@ atures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock e@@ p@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ p@@ h@@ r@@ ine more easily .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communic@@ ated by children who are having an aller@@ g@@ i@@ c reaction .
Kids may say , " It feels like something is p@@ o@@ king my tongue , " " My tongue feels like there is hair on it , " or " My tongue is t@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ling . "
N@@ SA Aff@@ air E@@ m@@ p@@ h@@ a@@ s@@ izes Comple@@ te L@@ ack of Debate on Intelligence
Why the contradic@@ tory attitude of the French government ? On the one hand , it publicly takes offence and s@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ ons the Ambassador of the United States on October 21 and , on the other , it f@@ o@@ r@@ b@@ i@@ ds the B@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ vian president 's plane to enter its air space on the basis of a rum@@ or that Edward S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den was on board ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French government .
When F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ç@@ ois Holl@@ a@@ n@@ de telep@@ hones Barack Obama , or when Foreign Minister L@@ a@@ u@@ r@@ ent Fab@@ i@@ us s@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ ons the Ambassador of the United States , they are responding to a real discovery , that of the scale of America 's surveillance of communications within France generally .
And is it not surprising to read in the pages of Le M@@ o@@ n@@ de , on the one hand , a reproduction of diplomatic correspon@@ d@@ ence with the US and , on the other , condemnation of the N@@ SA 's s@@ p@@ ying on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Q@@ u@@ ai d '@@ O@@ r@@ say , within a matter of weeks ?
Is there not an element of hypo@@ cris@@ y on your part ?
The journalistic method is not to adopt a moral position , but to investigate the significance and r@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ v@@ ance of information and enable every citiz@@ en to form an opinion .
When Wiki@@ L@@ e@@ aks reveals the American administration 's monitoring of political and other matters somewhere in the world , we consider this to be significant enligh@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ ment with regard to the American government .
In describing the American methods of data interception in r@@ e@@ l@@ ation to the French diplomatic representation in the United States , we do not aim at expres@@ sing indignation about this practice , but rather at describing the world as it is .
Has France benefited from the intelligence supplied by the N@@ SA concerning terrorist operations against our interests ?
Can we do without collaboration with the Americans ?
The setting up of high-@@ performance interception technology over prac@@ tically the past ten years by the United States - and by France - has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Fur@@ thermore , in this regard , France and the United States in particular have implemented procedures , sometimes described as essential , for c@@ o@@ operating and exchanging information on an almost daily basis .
For example , France was informed of the presence of Mohammed M@@ e@@ r@@ ah in the tribal areas of Mir@@ a@@ n@@ shah through the N@@ SA 's resources .
Also France may , for example , have to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sa@@ h@@ e@@ l region to the Americans and , in return - as already briefly mentioned - the Americans may provide information to the French about other parts of the world .
H@@ ence the question at the heart of the N@@ SA affair is not so much the capacity or the right of a country to use interception tools , as the issue of the complete lack of prior debate - especially within parliam@@ ents - on the justi@@ fication of such systems , the extent to which they should be used and , ultimately , the issue of the infr@@ ingement of freedoms .
What risk does the United States actually run ? Ru@@ i@@ n@@ ing its image ?
However much we den@@ ounce the US , I see no way in which it can be punished .
The risk run by the Americans could be t@@ w@@ o@@ f@@ old .
The first is when their allies - as has been the case recently - learn that their governments have been spi@@ ed on , sometimes at the highest level .
This is the case in Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States are strained .
Another effect could be more commercial : in the light of the revelations , more and more European and South American countries are balking at the idea of e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ sting their confidential data to American providers that are subject to American law and hence to the gri@@ ps of the N@@ SA .
Finally , the widespread exercise in revelations conducted by the media across the world , which is contributing to the establishment of a debate on surveillance practices by intelligence services that have been almost invisible until now , could force legislators - including those of America - to r@@ e@@ consider the powers they have granted their intelligence agencies .
Parents of I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex Kids Can Pick ' Gender U@@ n@@ determin@@ e@@ d@@ '
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambigu@@ ous g@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ a .
No longer will new@@ b@@ o@@ r@@ ns be rigi@@ dly assigned to male or female .
The new law doesn 't require parents to declare any gender for such children , allowing parents to declare gender " u@@ n@@ determined " or " unspecified " on their birth certi@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ates .
The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make has@@ ty decisions on s@@ e@@ x@@ -@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ment surgery for new@@ b@@ o@@ r@@ ns , and to fight discrimination against those who are i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex .
One i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex person , according to the BBC , said years later , " I am neither a man nor a woman . "
I will remain the pat@@ c@@ h@@ work created by doctors , bru@@ ised and scar@@ red .
An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl .
They are i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex , part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagno@@ sis of disorders of sexual development , an umb@@ rella term for those with a@@ t@@ y@@ p@@ ical chrom@@ osom@@ es , g@@ o@@ n@@ ads ( ovaries or t@@ e@@ s@@ tes ) , or unusually developed g@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ a .
W@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ s Simpson may have been i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex .
Gender identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined , it 's better to use the best available information to assi@@ gn it then to wait and monitor the child 's psych@@ ological and physical development before undertaking surgery , if at all .
New York City psychi@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ ist Dr. Jack D@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ cher , who speci@@ alizes in issues of gender identification , said the new German law " sounds like a good thing . "
I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex children pose ethical dilem@@ ma .
" Some people have life-@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ ering conditions that require surgery , but most kids do not , " he said .
You can make a gender a@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ment without surgery , and then see how identity develops .
The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accur@@ ate .
Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens .
It 's like the mystery of why people are gay .
A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex people as different from t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ sexual or t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ gender people , as their status is not gender related but instead r@@ e@@ l@@ ates to their biological makeup , which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female , but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either .
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual character@@ istics , such as muscle mass , hair distribution , breasts and stature ; primary sexual character@@ istics such as reproductive organs and g@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ a ; or in chrom@@ osom@@ al structures and hor@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ es .
The report also gives an o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ view of the discrimination faced by i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex and t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ gender people in the r@@ e@@ alm of employment , as well as levels of harassment , violence and bias crimes .
Gender non@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ forming boys now have special camp .
Already , Australia and Nep@@ al allow adults to mark male , female or a " third gender " on their official documents .
In June , a 52-year-old Australian , Norrie May@@ -@@ Wel@@ by , became the world 's first recognized " gend@@ e@@ r@@ less " person after winning a legal appeal to keep an " unspecified " gender status for life .
German passports will have a third design@@ ation other than M or F -- X , for i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex , according to the Interior Ministry .
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for " gender theory " to be withdrawn from school text@@ books .
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law , writing that " as the world is being dragged into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , we reverse two more p@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ars of c@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ zation . "
One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth .
" Parenting is stress@@ ful enough without extra limitations , especially if you don 't know the gender of your child , " she told the parenting website .
Children need stability and certainty .
H@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ r@@ ically , children born with both male and female g@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ a were called her@@ m@@ a@@ p@@ h@@ r@@ o@@ d@@ ites , named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality .
And as little as a decade ago , the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then r@@ e@@ drawn .
But now , many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery , knowing that gender identity is complex , and doctors can sometimes get it wrong , not knowing how a child will feel about their gender a@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ment when they grow up .
" Back in the middle of the 20th century , it was called a ' psychi@@ atric emergency , ' " said D@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ cher .
When these kids were born , you didn 't call the psychi@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ ist , you called a surgeon .
The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambigu@@ ous g@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ a was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University , who held that gender was m@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ e@@ able .
He c@@ o@@ ined the term " gender identity " and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ acted with a child 's genes and hor@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ es to shape whether the person identified as male or female .
But in one 1966 case , known as " John / Joan , " his theories became controversial .
He advised the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is had been s@@ e@@ vered in a bot@@ ched circu@@ m@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on to have the child fully c@@ a@@ s@@ trated , removing his testi@@ c@@ les , as well , and to raise him as a girl .
" Money presented the case as a successful case of transition , but it was not , " said D@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ cher .
When the boy was around 15 , he transi@@ tioned back to a boy and married a woman .
But at 38 , he committed suicide .
D@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ cher said that now some doctors are still " practicing that model . "
But in the 1990s , with the advent of the Internet , s@@ u@@ r@@ viv@@ ors of these gender surg@@ eries have come forward " not happy with the outcome . "
Such was the case with Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old writer from Montana , who was born with X@@ Y male chrom@@ osom@@ es but ambigu@@ ous g@@ e@@ n@@ itals .
Doctors couldn 't be sure if he had a large c@@ l@@ i@@ tor@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced he could never live a " satisfactory life " as a man .
So shortly after his birth in 1976 , Bruce 's external organ and t@@ e@@ s@@ tes were surg@@ ically removed and he was raised as a girl .
He was given female hor@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ es at age 12 .
" I knew that I wasn 't a girl , " he told AB@@ C@@ New@@ s.com .
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 , he was set for a v@@ a@@ g@@ i@@ n@@ o@@ p@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ ty .
But depressed and knowing something was wrong , he demanded medical records .
What he found out was horri@@ fying .
I was ster@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ zed at birth -- and no one ever told me .
Bruce was born with a D@@ S@@ D that prevented his body from producing enough t@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ ster@@ one to properly develop his g@@ e@@ n@@ itals .
After learning the truth , he changed back to a man , taking t@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ ster@@ one shots and having his breasts removed .
Surgery rend@@ ered him i@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ le .
Today , he advocates for others in an organization called the I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ face Project , trying to norm@@ alize p@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tions of those who are i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ sex .
But Anne Tam@@ a@@ r@@ -@@ Mat@@ tis , executive director for Califor@@ nia-based legal group Advoc@@ ates for I@@ n@@ formed Cho@@ ice , worries that the German law " i@@ n@@ v@@ ites labeling and stig@@ ma . "
" A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an ' u@@ n@@ determined , ' " she said .
We are afraid it will encourage intervention .
We think a better process is assigning male or female sex , then waiting .
But we haven 't seen how the law will play out , so all we can do is specul@@ ate .
Tam@@ a@@ r@@ -@@ Mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the Australian law because " it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender . "
" Adul@@ ts should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender , " she said .
German law is about assigning it at birth .
That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point .
When they are grown , they can make decisions about their own bodies .
But Dr. A@@ r@@ l@@ ene B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ t@@ z , a Pittsburgh breast radi@@ ologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group , said the German law will " empower " both parents and children .
B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ t@@ z 's daughter Katie was born with male chrom@@ osom@@ es , but has a D@@ S@@ D called complete androgen i@@ n@@ sensi@@ tivity syndrome .
Because her androgen recep@@ tors are f@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ ty , Katie developed female character@@ istics .
She has a v@@ a@@ g@@ ina , but no u@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ us or ovaries .
Now at 29 , Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania , a resident in child psychi@@ atry .
Though she is i@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ le , she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gest@@ ational s@@ u@@ r@@ rog@@ acy .
" The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves , " said B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ t@@ z .
It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write ' male ' or ' female . ' 
This way , you are OK -- raise the child , love the child .
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun .
We don 't have to rush into surgery that is i@@ r@@ rever@@ s@@ i@@ ble .
" It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they don 't feel they are doing the right thing , " she said .
Ultimately , the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that 's a wonderful thing .
It e@@ m@@ powers children to make the decision for themselves .
Let@@ ta C@@ o@@ n@@ fid@@ ent of Government 's Sur@@ v@@ i@@ val
The President of the Italian Council , Enric@@ o Let@@ ta , believes his government will last until 2@@ 0@@ 15 , despite strong tension between the left and right wings within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate 's vote on stri@@ pping Sil@@ v@@ i@@ o B@@ e@@ r@@ l@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ i of his mand@@ ate .
In an interview with daily newspaper La S@@ t@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ a , the leader of the centre left said he had " every intention " of continuing to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2@@ 0@@ 15 .
The Upper House of the Italian parliament will meet this month to decide on the fate of the former president , who was found guilty of tax evasion in August .
Sil@@ v@@ i@@ o B@@ e@@ r@@ l@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ i is threatening to withdraw his support to the government if the Senate , in which he has more opponents than supporters , deci@@ des to r@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ eve him of his duties .
But one section of his camp , centered around the national secretary of the People of Freedom ( P@@ D@@ L ) party , Angel@@ ino A@@ l@@ f@@ ano , is continuing to support the government , as it demonstrated on October 2 when it refused to follow B@@ e@@ r@@ l@@ u@@ s@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ i 's orders on a previous attempt to bring down the cabinet .
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the United States Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) and a suspect have been wounded during an exchange of gunfire .
Fi@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ en called to the scene of the drama confirmed that they had responded to a call reporting " multiple injuries . "
" Law enforcement agents are at the scene , " the airport stated on its Tw@@ itter account , while television pictures were showing people being evacuated in ambulances .
" There was a shoo@@ t@@ -@@ out , " a spokesman for the United States Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) told the AFP .
Local channel ABC showed one person being evacuated on a s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ t@@ cher and a second in a wheelchair .
The airport also stated that the incident took place at around 9.@@ 30@@ am local time ( 12.@@ 30@@ pm Montreal time ) in Terminal 3 of the airport .
The Los Angeles Times stated that terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated .
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm on the spot whether one of its staff had been injured .
All flights arriving at and leaving the airport have been suspended .
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed a Hamas Palestinian Islamic militant and left another seriously wounded south of the Gaza Strip on Thursday , according to healthcare sources .
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the region after Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mort@@ ar fire .
The Israeli army simply mentioned carrying out " targeted action " in the area close to what the Jewish state calls a " terrorist " tunnel d@@ u@@ g at the border , the discovery of which was reported in mid-@@ October .
Report : Obama campaign considered dum@@ ping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama 's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket , according to the New York Times .
The rev@@ e@@ l@@ ation is the most notable b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ shell from Mark Hal@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ in and John H@@ e@@ i@@ l@@ emann 's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign t@@ ome , " Dou@@ ble Down : Game Change 2012 . "
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President 's top aides conducted " extensive g@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ p-@@ sessions and poll@@ ing in late 2011 " to gauge whether the dum@@ ping Biden could help bol@@ ster Obama 's waning re-election hopes .
According to the Times ' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin , the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House , nam@@ ely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls .
The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office .
Only half a dozen of the President 's closest advisers -- including Daley , former Obama campaign chief Jim Mess@@ ina , and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David P@@ l@@ o@@ u@@ ffe -- knew the change was under consideration .
" Dou@@ ble Down " claims Daley s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ headed the effort to replace Biden , despite their " close personal rapport , " before ultimately deci@@ ding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn 't " materially improve Obama 's odds . "
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton .
" I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things , and this was one of them , " Daley told the paper .
You have to remember , at that point the President was in awful shape , so we were like , " Holy Christ , what do we do ? "
While Daley character@@ ized the research as " due diligence , " Martin told CNN 's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls .
" Camp@@ a@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ s don 't spend the kind of money on poll@@ ing and focus groups unless they 're seriously considering something , " Martin said on AC@@ 360 .
It 's unclear , however , whether Obama knew his team was expl@@ oring the swap .
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-@@ boss knew about the potential shuff@@ le .
While Daley said he doesn 't think the President " was aware " of the potential change , the former chief of staff admitted that it 's " possible " Obama knew .
Martin added that " Dou@@ ble Down " does not defin@@ iti@@ v@@ ely answer whether the political p@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ ing reached Obama 's desk .
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dum@@ ping Biden from the ticket .
" Possi@@ bly , " Martin replied .
F@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ y a g@@ low-@@ in-@@ the-@@ dark ice cream ?
A British entrepreneur has created the world 's first g@@ low-@@ in-@@ the-@@ dark ice cream - using jell@@ yfish .
Charlie Francis has h@@ a@@ r@@ n@@ essed the flu@@ ores@@ cent properties of the marine animal to develop the lumin@@ e@@ s@@ cent sn@@ ack .
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jell@@ yfish and convinced scientists in China to chem@@ ically r@@ e@@ c@@ reate the g@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ing protein .
The ice cream r@@ e@@ acts with the e@@ ater 's tongue - raising the p@@ H level in the protein and making it glow .
Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it r@@ e@@ acts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you l@@ i@@ c@@ k , the brigh@@ ter it becomes .
Charlie , founder of the " L@@ ick Me I 'm D@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ous " ice cream company , said : " It is i@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ dible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production , so £ 200 gets you about 2g of the stuff . "
The protein we are using in the ice cream r@@ e@@ acts with your tongue at neutr@@ al p@@ H .
So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the p@@ H level and the ice cream will glow .
We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect .
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jell@@ yfish lumin@@ escence is four times more expensive than gold .
So each sco@@ op costs me around £ 140 .
It tastes pretty good though .
Charlie 's experimental company , based in Bristol , is famed for its unusual f@@ l@@ avours including beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious .
He said : " I really want to develop an invisible ice cream . "
It is inher@@ ently impossible because of the refr@@ action caused by the ice c@@ r@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ als which make up the ice cream , but I reck@@ on we will find a way of doing it .
The ice cream h@@ a@@ r@@ nesses the flu@@ ores@@ cent properties of a jell@@ yfish , syn@@ thes@@ ized by Chinese scientists
Lou Reed Dies During T@@ ai Chi S@@ ession
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai c@@ h@@ i exer@@ cises , his wife , L@@ a@@ u@@ r@@ ie Anderson , announced in a letter published by the regional newspaper , East Hamp@@ ton Star , which is meant for residents of Spr@@ ings , the town where the couple had a home .
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71 .
" He died on Sunday morning while looking at the trees and doing the famous 21st form of tai c@@ h@@ i , with his musician hands striking the air , " wrote L@@ a@@ u@@ r@@ ie Anderson .
Lou Reed was a master of the Chinese m@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ al art known as tai c@@ h@@ i .
The singer 's wife also said that , a week before his death , she had promised her husband she would get him out of hospital and take him back to their home in Spr@@ ings ( Long Island ) .
" Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years .
Even though we are city dwellers , this is our spiritual home .
Lou was a p@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ce and a fighter , and I know his songs on pain and beauty in the world will fill many people with the i@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ dible joy of life which he felt , " she added .
Lou Reed had undergone a liver transplant last May .
Halloween 2@@ 0@@ 13 : By the Numbers
When I was little , Halloween was m@@ a@@ g@@ ical .
My sister and I were allowed to eat cand@@ y , stay up late and play dress-@@ up for the neighborhood .
Now@@ a@@ d@@ ays , I 've become more of a s@@ c@@ r@@ o@@ oge .
I haven 't signed up for the past two years to give out cand@@ y in my apartment and probably won 't this year .
But s@@ t@@ ats show that I 'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween .
The majority of Americans - 1@@ 5@@ 8 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion on cand@@ y , costumes and decor@@ ations , according to the National Retail Federation .
One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends .
Cost@@ u@@ m@@ es are expected to account for $ 1.2 billion dollars out of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
This year , sexy i@@ n@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ m@@ ate objects are all the rage .
Women don 't have to be sexy professionals anymore ; they can also be sexy foods like pizza , ham@@ b@@ u@@ r@@ gers and carrots .
As for men , I expect we will be seeing a lot of z@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ es , thanks to The Wal@@ king Dead and I 'll bet the Daft Pun@@ k space men will make it into our I@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ g@@ ram feeds this year .
According to Google , the highest searched costumes are z@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ es , Bat@@ man , pirates and wit@@ ches .
I guess there 's nothing wrong with going traditional .
We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amaz@@ ement we were not alone .
In fact , Americans will spend $ 330 million on pet costumes this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
That 's a lot of ironic hot@@ dog dogs .
When it comes to cand@@ y , we don 't scre@@ w around .
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion on it this year , according to The Nielsen Company .
That 's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars , l@@ o@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ pops , M@@ i@@ l@@ k D@@ u@@ ds , T@@ w@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ lers and Clark Bars .
That 's great news for the 41 million t@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ -@@ or-@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ ers set to take over our neighborhoods , according to the U.S. Commerce Department .
In fact , we will buy and , who are we kid@@ ding , c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ u@@ me 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween .
The one thing we don 't want to c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ u@@ me , cand@@ y corn ; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National C@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ c@@ tioners Association .
That 's about 9 billion individual k@@ ern@@ els of corn .
It 's a mystery I have yet to solve .
Nothing is more q@@ u@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ essentially Halloween than haunted houses .
They have the best names , like " Terr@@ or Behind the W@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ s " ( which , by the way is in an actual prison ) , " How@@ l-@@ O-@@ Scream " and " The House of S@@ h@@ ock . "
In fact , there are 1,200 officially s@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ tioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Ha@@ unts , and that includes those a@@ w@@ e@@ s@@ ome photos of you mid-@@ peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can 't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like " nice face . "
Finally , let 's talk p@@ u@@ mp@@ kins .
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great P@@ u@@ m@@ p@@ kin when we were kids , and c@@ a@@ r@@ ving a j@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ -@@ o@@ -@@ lan@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n is like decor@@ ating a Christmas tree - it 's something we 've done since we were little .
Lucky for us , the " baby in a p@@ u@@ mp@@ kin trend " started only last year thanks to P@@ interest , so most of us grew up c@@ a@@ r@@ ving these gour@@ ds not sitting in them .
This year , Americans will spend around $ 106 million on p@@ u@@ mp@@ kins , according to the U.S. Cen@@ sus Bureau .
The j@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ -@@ o@@ -@@ lan@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n slowly w@@ i@@ t@@ h@@ ering on your front porch probably came from Illinois , which grew 542 million pounds of p@@ u@@ mp@@ kin this year .
If you 're looking for extra credit , call Tim and Susan M@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ i@@ s@@ don in Nap@@ a , Calif . , and try to c@@ a@@ r@@ ve up their 2,0@@ 32 pound p@@ u@@ mp@@ kin .
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank structure to cover £ 38 billion ( € 4@@ 5,000 million ) of its highest risk assets , a step designed to improve its relations with the City and accelerate its r@@ e@@ -@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ v@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ ation .
The bank wants to reduce the p@@ r@@ o@@ portion of toxic assets on its books from 55 % to 70 % over the next two years and hopes to clean them up completely in three years .
RBS has also said that it will be writing down a provision of £ 4 500 million for the d@@ e@@ preciation of additional bad debts for the quarter , an entry related to the setting up of the h@@ i@@ ve-@@ off structure .
RBS has also specified that this internal restructuring would release £ 10-@@ 11 000 million in capital , thus s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ t@@ h@@ ening its lending ability .
The bank and the City have stressed that the " bad bank " would enable a break@@ -@@ off from the past , government in particular having been accused of i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ing in the management of RBS .
" We can now move f@@ o@@ r@@ wards and focus on the future and on the 90 % of assets that make up a really good bank , and on building a great bank for our clients and the United Kingdom , " new director general , Ross McEwan , said to the press .

They 're not all experienced racers , but people looking for excitement and adventure , and an achiev@@ able path towards world-class events .
We 're deli@@ ghted to be offering this path in partnership with Land Rover and the M@@ SA , and believe the format offers a new way to experience different rally d@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ l@@ ines in the UK and overseas , and prepare e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ ants for the rig@@ ours and r@@ e@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ ties of R@@ ally R@@ aid .
We 've really enjoyed developing the Def@@ ender Challenge car - it 'll be a really fun championship .
Additionally , the Def@@ ender Challenge will provide a training and test day in February , as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East .

Fi@@ refigh@@ ters a@@ b@@ s@@ e@@ il down c@@ l@@ i@@ ff face to p@@ l@@ uck the dog from certain death
A p@@ u@@ ppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50@@ ft up on a p@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ ous c@@ l@@ i@@ ff l@@ e@@ dge .
Nine month-@@ old c@@ o@@ cker s@@ p@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ el Ru@@ by had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .
Her owners Scott A@@ l@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ son , 25 , and his girlfriend Bec@@ ky Hall , 20 , were at F@@ l@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ it Q@@ u@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ y in Den@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ me , West Yorkshire , to be r@@ e@@ united with Ru@@ by and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .
They had searched f@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ tically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident .
At around 2@@ .@@ 1@@ 5@@ pm on Wednesday , an e@@ a@@ g@@ l@@ e@@ -@@ eyed dog w@@ a@@ l@@ ker spotted Ru@@ by on the l@@ e@@ dge in the quarry , stranded 50@@ ft up .
A Techn@@ ical Rescue Team from C@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ k@@ h@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ on Fire Station rushed to the scene and a@@ b@@ s@@ e@@ i@@ l@@ ed down to rescue Ru@@ by and used a pet tube to transport her up the c@@ l@@ i@@ ff .
Speci@@ alist Techn@@ ical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said : ' She was in a p@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ ous situation .
She was right in the middle of the c@@ l@@ i@@ ff face - 50@@ ft from the top and bottom .
She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid .
But she is fine now .
She was eating bis@@ c@@ u@@ its afterwards .
This was a very unusual c@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ out .
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable .
Speci@@ alist Techn@@ ical Rescue Officer Peter L@@ au said : " Ru@@ by had a very lucky escape . "
The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was taken to the vets for a check@@ -up and was found to be fine other than exhau@@ s@@ tion and dehydr@@ ation .
Miss Hall , from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : " Watching the rescue was terri@@ fying . "
I could not believe that she was up there in the first place .
It was amazing to get her back in our arms .
The v@@ et said that if she became too exhausted and collapsed she would probably have fallen .
The firefighters were amazing .
It was really daring what they did .
We are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremendous .
Mr A@@ l@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ son , from Ke@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ley , added : " We were scared that she might fall but she stayed there . "
The firefighters were brilliant .
I just can 't believe where she was .
M@@ ick Jag@@ ger says he never hit on Kat@@ y Perry when she was 18 .
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week , the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jag@@ ger 's 2004 song " Old Hab@@ its Die Hard . "
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker and that " he hit on me when I was 18 . "
She added , " That was a long time ago , and he 's been very kind . "
In a statement Thursday , a representative for Jag@@ ger , 70 , says he " categorically denies that he has ever made a pass at Kat@@ y Perry . "
The rep adds : " Perhaps she is confusing him with someone else . "
Perry was one of the s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers to make a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones ' tour this year .
Her new album , " Pris@@ m , " d@@ e@@ b@@ u@@ ted at No. 1 this week .
Beijing B@@ l@@ a@@ m@@ es Turk@@ oman Islamic Movement
" Beh@@ i@@ n@@ d@@ -the-@@ scenes support for the attack came from the East Turk@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ an Islamic Movement ( E@@ TI@@ M ) based in central and western Asia , " declared the head of the Chinese security services to a Hong Kong television channel , according to a video posted online on Thursday evening .
Men@@ g J@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ z@@ h@@ u , a member of the Policy Bureau of the Communist Party of China ( C@@ PC ) made the statement in T@@ a@@ s@@ h@@ k@@ ent while on an official visit to U@@ z@@ b@@ e@@ k@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an .
This is the first time that a senior Chinese official has named a specific organisation following the attack on Monday .
According to Chinese police , three members of one U@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ur family from the predominantly Muslim region of X@@ i@@ n@@ j@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ g , which shares borders with a number of central Asian countries , drove a car loaded with cans of petrol against the entrance of the F@@ o@@ r@@ b@@ i@@ d@@ den City in Beijing , in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured .
The driver of the vehicle , his wife and his mother all died in the fire in the car .
E@@ TI@@ M , which is fighting for independence for East Turk@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ an - the former name of Chinese X@@ i@@ n@@ j@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ g - was classified by the UN@@ O in 2002 as one of the organisations affili@@ ated with Al-@@ Qaida .
The movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for spor@@ adic trouble in X@@ i@@ n@@ j@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ g , although many experts cast doubt on its true influence .
George Ker@@ e@@ v@@ an : Europe break@@ -up gives Sco@@ ts choice
Another day , another independence scare story .
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the E@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ -@@ wide free-@@ travel zone as a condition of EU membership .
Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along H@@ a@@ d@@ r@@ i@@ an 's Wall .
True , the Stra@@ t@@ h@@ c@@ l@@ y@@ de paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe , though - predic@@ t@@ a@@ b@@ ly - that did not figure in the headlines .
Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time b@@ ending their formal rules if it suits them .
Since Scotland isn 't in the S@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ en area now , continued non-@@ compliance would be a cheap conc@@ ession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Sco@@ ts .
So , a non-@@ story , then .
And one that is so long in the t@@ o@@ o@@ th it has become f@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ sed : I first heard the " independence means passport controls " c@@ a@@ n@@ ard at least 40 years ago .
Yet there is an interesting point lost in this r@@ e@@ t@@ elling of a whis@@ k@@ ery old tale .
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe 's b@@ i@@ d@@ ding , anyway ?
Why trade London 's y@@ o@@ ke for that of Brussels , especially now ?
Here is the real European news : the great , post-@@ war plan to u@@ n@@ ite Europe has finally stalled .
With the euro crisis , Project Europe is officially dead .
Across the EU , parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU , or to s@@ c@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ ing the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Euro@@ s@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September 's federal elections , thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats ( equivalent to our own Lib Dems ) out of the Bun@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ag .
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis has proved a water@@ shed .
The a@@ u@@ ster@@ ity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , c@@ o@@ u@@ pled with the strai@@ t@@ jacket imposed on national economies through a@@ d@@ her@@ ence to the common currency , has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far .
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget d@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ its - that was true only of Gre@@ ece .
Rather , the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favour@@ able to German e@@ x@@ porters - something German politicians want to keep .
Without the possibility of domestic currency d@@ e@@ v@@ alu@@ ation , southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity d@@ i@@ s@@ advantage v@@ i@@ s@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ v@@ is Germany .
The only recourse is to sl@@ ash wages and public spending - s@@ p@@ u@@ r@@ red on by Berlin .
Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise .
As a result of " green " energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for s@@ u@@ b@@ s@@ i@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ ing French and German energy firms at the consumer 's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas , as in the United States .
That is a crip@@ p@@ l@@ ing cost d@@ i@@ s@@ advantage , as we 've already seen at Gran@@ gem@@ o@@ u@@ th .
All the wage free@@ zes in the world won 't stop the European petro@@ chemicals industry being ham@@ mered by cheap US s@@ h@@ ale gas .
As a result , revolt is brewing , especially in France , once the EU 's main cheer@@ leader .
After the war , the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check , and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legi@@ tim@@ acy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe , leaving the bat@@ tered French economy struggling .
R@@ e@@ s@@ ult : Marine Le Pen 's right-@@ wing , anti-@@ EU National Front has just won a crucial by-@@ election , knocking the ruling S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ alists into third place .
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can 't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left .
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white , working class ?
She wants to use next year 's EU elections to create an anti-@@ EU , anti-@@ common currency bloc across the European Parliament .
If , as is very possible , anti-@@ EU parties do well in these elections , such a bloc could domin@@ ate the European Parliament for the first time .
Here 's my point : s@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ time soon growing anti-@@ EU and anti-@@ common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro .
The EU won 't disappear , but it will r@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t to something more like the loose " Europe of the ( Sovereign ) Nations " favoured by General de Gaul@@ le .
Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revi@@ ve their own currencies .
I expect the UK will distance itself from this project , hoping to c@@ o@@ sy up to the US .
However , Washington 's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold .
Where does this leave Scotland ?
We can choose to be a region of ( essentially ) Little England .
Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off .
I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a l@@ o@@ o@@ s@@ er European arrangement provided we kept our own currency .
C@@ o@@ -@@ operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-@@ federal Europe of the Nations .
Otherwise we should consider e@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ ating Norway and r@@ e@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ing our economic independence .
The SNP government in Scotland is - remark@@ a@@ b@@ l@@ y@@ -- the most successful anti-@@ a@@ u@@ ster@@ ity political movement in Europe , having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by Labour 's chanc@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ or Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tor@@ y@@ -@@ Lib D@@ e@@ m coalition .
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept a@@ u@@ ster@@ ity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
Early puber@@ ty : G@@ rowing older sooner
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puber@@ ty earlier than their white counterparts , research shows .
Phys@@ ical changes don 't mean puber@@ ty is imminent
There 's no evidence that hor@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ es or other chemicals are to blame
Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one t@@ r@@ i@@ g@@ ger of early puber@@ ty
The trend toward early puber@@ ty is not as pronounced with boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Ether@@ idge is a journalist speci@@ alizing in children 's health and family issues .
Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to spr@@ out breast b@@ u@@ ds and p@@ u@@ bic hair at 7 or 8 ?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of P@@ e@@ d@@ i@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ s this week in Orlando , Florida , pedi@@ atric e@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ologist Dr. Paul Ka@@ p@@ l@@ owitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new n@@ o@@ r@@ m .
" I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually , this does not signal a rapid progres@@ sion into full puber@@ ty , " said Ka@@ p@@ l@@ owitz .
Ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous signs of development , such as bud@@ ding breasts , p@@ u@@ bic and u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ arm hair and body od@@ or are appearing sooner in girls .
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of m@@ e@@ n@@ a@@ r@@ che ( the first period ) over the past four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , down from 12.@@ 75 in 1970 .
" Once breasts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years before m@@ e@@ n@@ a@@ r@@ che , " said Ka@@ p@@ l@@ owitz , also author of " Early P@@ u@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ ty in Girls : The Ess@@ ential Guide to Cop@@ ing with This Common Problem . "
Time is the most accur@@ ate test of how puber@@ ty is going to progress .
There is debate about what constitu@@ tes the actual o@@ n@@ set of puber@@ ty , but it is considered " p@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ous " when breast e@@ n@@ l@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ ement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8 .
In most cases , the process will slow down or stall -- something a pedi@@ atrician can monitor closely .
A more rapid progres@@ sion may warrant tests by an e@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or c@@ y@@ s@@ ts .
There are treatments to delay early m@@ e@@ n@@ ses and ward off another c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ e@@ q@@ u@@ ence : premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to s@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ ted growth and being short as an adult .
R@@ e@@ c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child 's age , rate of development , growth rate and emotional matur@@ ity .
Psy@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ social aspects are important , too .
Ka@@ p@@ l@@ owitz is cautious with medic@@ ation but acknowledges , " s@@ u@@ p@@ pressing puber@@ ty may allevi@@ ate behavi@@ oral issues and girls ' feelings of being different from peers . "
The other big issue is understand@@ able : Parents simply don 't want their very young daughters having periods .
" They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene , " said Ka@@ p@@ l@@ owitz .
" It was a shock , " recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10 .
Even though there were signs and we had talked about m@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ ation , she was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends .
There are lots of well-@@ publicized theories about the causes of p@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ous puber@@ ty .
Yet , there 's no consistent body of evidence that hor@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ es in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame .
Boys - like girls - are hitting puber@@ ty earlier .
Ka@@ p@@ l@@ owitz c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ ends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity .
He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9@@ -year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puber@@ ty .
Other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other contributing factors .
In this country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puber@@ ty earlier than their white counterparts .
There are varying e@@ x@@ plan@@ ations .
Glob@@ ally , patterns of early puber@@ ty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes .
Another conundrum : Although boys are getting facial and p@@ u@@ bic hair at younger ages , the trend toward full-@@ blown early puber@@ ty is not as pronounced as it is with girls .
Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ e@@ x@@ i@@ ties of the topic .
The appearance of a@@ c@@ ne and p@@ u@@ bic hair is common even in infants and t@@ o@@ d@@ d@@ lers .
" We need to be careful about how we identify the true o@@ n@@ set of puber@@ ty , " said Dr. Lawrence Sil@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ man , a pedi@@ atric e@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ologist at G@@ o@@ r@@ y@@ e@@ b Children 's Hospital in Morris@@ town , New Jersey .
Parents should not hes@@ itate to get guidance from their pedi@@ atrician about how to talk with their child .
" It may mean having a s@@ o@@ o@@ n@@ er-than-@@ expected conversation , " Ka@@ p@@ l@@ owitz advised .
If you remain calm , your child usually will respond well .
Girls who blo@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ m early need reassurance that , even when it happens ahead of schedule , the process is a normal part of life .
C@@ o@@ en Brothers ' Hom@@ age to Fol@@ k Music
" Inside L@@ l@@ e@@ w@@ yn Davis " by the C@@ o@@ en brothers , winners of the Grand P@@ r@@ i@@ x at the last C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ es Film Festival , is a n@@ o@@ stal@@ g@@ i@@ c comedy set in Green@@ wich Village in 1@@ 9@@ 6@@ 1 and based on folk music , which was just bud@@ ding there prior to the arrival of Bob Dylan .
Joel and Ethan C@@ o@@ en , whose f@@ i@@ l@@ m@@ o@@ graph@@ y has recently been the subject of a review at the " Cin@@ é@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ è@@ que f@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ç@@ aise , " sco@@ o@@ p@@ ed the P@@ a@@ l@@ me d '@@ Or at C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ es in 1991 with Barton Fink .
Since they could not hire Dylan or the Peter , Paul and Mary trio , Joel and Ethan C@@ o@@ en o@@ p@@ ted for a rising American movie star , Oscar Isa@@ ac , aged 33 , and global pop star Justin Timber@@ lake .
In this film bursting with humour , where the music is a central character and the songs are performed live , Oscar Isa@@ ac proved himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer , while Timber@@ lake , his friend in the film , a@@ b@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ ons pop for folk music with c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ g@@ i@@ ous gle@@ e .
Carey M@@ u@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ g@@ an , in turn , a@@ b@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ ons the wealthy trapp@@ ings of Daisy Bu@@ chanan in " The Great Gat@@ s@@ by " for less gli@@ t@@ zy clothes ; her singing voice is soft , but her language very c@@ o@@ a@@ r@@ se when she speaks .
" Inside L@@ l@@ e@@ w@@ yn Davis " tells the story of a week of t@@ r@@ i@@ bul@@ ations for a folk singer who has failed to get a break and is angry with the whole world .
He reluct@@ antly accepts last minute s@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ -in roles at studios .
With nowhere to live , he sleep@@ s on the c@@ o@@ u@@ ches of friends who will still have him .
Document@@ ary-@@ style
" His relationship with success is tor@@ tured , and that 's what interested us : a mix of bad luck and a guy who 's never in the right place at the right time , not care@@ er-@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ated , but honest , with a tendency towards self-@@ destruction , " Ethan C@@ o@@ en , who , with his brother Joel , has won several Osc@@ ars and C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ es prizes , told the press .
Even though L@@ l@@ e@@ w@@ yn Davis never existed , the two directors , who are folk music fans , based their story on real people of the time , such as folk musician Dave Van R@@ o@@ n@@ k .
The idea was to portray the moment preced@@ ing the advent of Green@@ wich Village , the New York district d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ined to become " the e@@ p@@ i@@ c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ e of the folk music boom that created international stars , " according to the journalist Eli@@ j@@ ah Wal@@ d , a friend of Van R@@ o@@ n@@ k .
The film has the feel of a documentary , from the f@@ u@@ sty record label o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ run with unsold L@@ P@@ s and i@@ n@@ h@@ a@@ b@@ ited by a pric@@ eless old secretary , to the musical choices of the studios of the day and the caf@@ é@@ s where the s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers performed .
The C@@ o@@ en brothers ' magic continues to work by integrating a comical character who is perman@@ ently on screen : a magni@@ ficent , cute g@@ inger cat who is L@@ l@@ e@@ w@@ yn Davis ' companion in fate .
Asked how he had developed his character , the actor and singer Justin Timber@@ lake recalled how he " grew up in Tennessee , bath@@ ed in the blu@@ es and country music . "
" My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather . He taught me to play the guitar , " he added .
Timber@@ lake says that although you have to work " to be considered good ... luck can also launch your career ... more and more so today . "
Like L@@ l@@ e@@ w@@ yn Davis , who refuses to compromise on his music , the pop star says that in a career , " the most important thing is to avoid getting trapped by things that prevent us from expres@@ sing ourselves . "
Gerard de Villiers , " SAS " Series Auth@@ or , Dies .
He never got to know the meaning of the word " retirement . "
Gerard de Villiers , a phenomenon of the French writing world , who died on Thursday at 83 , had just published his 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ th " SAS " book , " La Ven@@ g@@ e@@ ance du Kremlin . "
In February , the New York Times dubbed him " the spy novelist who knew too much . "
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan , the setting of numbers 198 and 1@@ 9@@ 9 of his celebrated spy novel series .
He had been in poor health since having a major heart attack in December 2010 , and , on this trip , he had been using a walking frame .
Prior to Afghanistan , he had also been to Libya , Russia , Lebanon and Mali .
Gerard Villiers , who was born on 8 December 1@@ 9@@ 29 in Paris , published four SAS books every year , and said he did not know how many books he had sold since the publication of " SAS à Istanbul , " the first in the series , almost half a century ago in 1965 .
" P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ ably between 120 and 150 million , if you include every country , " he c@@ o@@ n@@ j@@ e@@ ctu@@ red last March .
In the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Avenue Fo@@ ch , just a short distance from the A@@ r@@ c de Tri@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ he , with his Burmese cat on his knee and a m@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ ous t@@ w@@ ink@@ le in his eye under the white hair , he listed some of the languages the adventures of SAS had been translated into : Italian , German , Russian , Greek , Japanese and Korean .
" That 's not counting the pirate publications , " he added , pointing to a pile of books on the low table , between the b@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ze and i@@ v@@ ory a@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ facts collected from the 130 countries he had surveyed for the sett@@ ings of his novels .
At the price of a pack@@ et of cigarettes , the reader gets a book bearing the traditional cover , featuring a photo of a young woman with an a@@ m@@ p@@ le b@@ o@@ s@@ o@@ m , carrying a pistol or an assault rifle .
Inside , His S@@ e@@ r@@ ene High@@ ness ( SAS ) Prince Mal@@ ko L@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ e , a p@@ e@@ n@@ n@@ i@@ l@@ ess Austri@@ an aristo@@ crat and contract agent for the CIA ( to pay the bills for r@@ e@@ p@@ airing the family mansion ) , is hot on the heels of all the world 's e@@ v@@ il-@@ d@@ o@@ ers - c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ ists in the 70s and 80s , then jihad@@ ists since the 90s .
Each book follows the same formula : a large dose of geo@@ politics and the exo@@ tic , several r@@ a@@ c@@ y sex scenes , a touch of violence and torture .
" I never made any claim to being an author of great literature , " explained Gerard de Villiers .
" I think of myself as a story@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ er who writes to e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ ain people , not send them a message . "
He worked " like the great pre-@@ war reporters , in the likes of Albert Lond@@ res , who went on location and came back with proper , lengthy investigations . "
The creator of SAS said he was " making a sort of geo@@ political s@@ o@@ a@@ p opera . "
" I follow up my files ( on Afghanistan , Syria e@@ t@@ c ) const@@ antly before setting off , " added de Villiers .
On location , I meet journalists , including those of the AFP , diplomats , and services staff , some of whom I have known for twenty or thir@@ ty years .
As a result , some of his SAS novels have been p@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ ory : a month before an attack on a command centre of the Syrian government , in which several senior officials were killed , he had already told the story in " Le C@@ h@@ e@@ m@@ in de Dam@@ as . "
In " Les F@@ ous de B@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ h@@ a@@ z@@ i , " he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in the city , the c@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ le of the Libyan revolt .
In 1980 , he described the assassination of Egyptian president A@@ n@@ war Sad@@ at in " Le c@@ o@@ m@@ plot du C@@ a@@ i@@ re " a year before the attack .
In October 2012 , in " Pan@@ i@@ que à B@@ a@@ m@@ a@@ k@@ o , " he mentioned colum@@ ns of 4@@ x@@ 4@@ s of jihad@@ ists sweeping towards the M@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ an capital .
" I 'm no s@@ e@@ er , " Gerard de Villiers would say in his defence . " I simply make c@@ o@@ n@@ j@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ ures based on countries that I know well and , occasionally , some of my c@@ o@@ n@@ j@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ ures come true . "
After travelling to - often troubled - zones , he would spend a month at his 1976 IBM d@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ y wheel ty@@ p@@ e@@ writer , " every part of which has been replaced . "
300 pages later , he would write the words " The End " and correct each page by hand .
On the walls of his office hang A@@ K@@ -@@ 47 assault rif@@ les , ero@@ tic photos and photos of the author with African war l@@ o@@ r@@ ds .
De Villiers was regularly criticised by f@@ e@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ ist groups for male c@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ vin@@ ism and by human rights organisations for racism - accusations he would dismiss in two sentences :
" Some women in my books are sex objects , others are beautiful , intelligent , brave women .
I have always been well-@@ received in Africa , where I have a very large number of readers . "
Gerard de Villiers said it himself : " Like all heroes , Mal@@ ko L@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ e is a@@ g@@ eless .
He will not die and will not retire .
Any more than I will . "
Jet makers feu@@ d over seat width with big orders at stake
A row has f@@ l@@ ared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-@@ distance flights , setting the t@@ one for a bitter confrontation at this month 's Dubai Air@@ show .
The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-@@ haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines , but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches ( 46 cm ) wide in economy cab@@ ins , but its U.S. arch@@ -@@ rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide .
The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-@@ larger versions of their twin-@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ined long-@@ distance aircraft , with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-@@ 21 event .
How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 a@@ b@@ r@@ e@@ ast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new " mini-@@ jum@@ bo " jet designs .
Boeing says its rev@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ ed " 77@@ 7@@ X " will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row .
Airbus says the competing version of its A@@ 350 will carry 350 people in 18-@@ i@@ n@@ ch-@@ wide economy seat laid out 9 a@@ b@@ r@@ e@@ ast .
Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press .
Now , Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air@@ show , where the 77@@ 7@@ X is expected to domin@@ ate with more than 100 orders .
It recently p@@ r@@ e@@ viewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financi@@ ers a slide illustr@@ ating three people squ@@ ashed together at a restaurant , titled " Would You Acc@@ ept This ? "
" Boeing is proposing long-@@ distance flying in seats nar@@ rower than regional t@@ u@@ r@@ b@@ o@@ -@@ props , " said Airbus sales chief John L@@ e@@ a@@ h@@ y .
As diets change , people get bigger but plane seating has not rad@@ ically changed .
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 7@@ 47 jum@@ bo defined modern long-@@ haul travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American 40@@ - to 49@@ -year-old male increased by 10 per cent , according to U.S. Health Department Data .
The wai@@ st of the average 2@@ 1@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ century American male is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 inches , according to U.S. health statisti@@ cs .
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average gir@@ th of the newly c@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ tened " jet set " was nar@@ rower .
Airbus says it has commis@@ sion@@ ed research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
Boeing dispu@@ tes Airbus 's figures on seat m@@ e@@ a@@ s@@ u@@ rements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities .
It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat .
" It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , " said Boeing cab@@ ins expert Kent Cr@@ a@@ v@@ er .
They don 't want us to dict@@ ate to them what makes them profitable .
They know their business better than anyone else .
For f@@ l@@ yers it is about more elbow room , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings .
Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 7@@ 00-@@ billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the s@@ c@@ ales of U.S. and European exports .
As Reuters first reported in July , seat lay@@ out is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets .
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ined long-@@ haul designs than the market leader in that segment , the 36@@ 5-@@ seat Boeing 77@@ 7-@@ 300@@ ER .
Boeing 's performance claims dep@@ end in part on comparing the 10-@@ a@@ b@@ r@@ e@@ ast 77@@ 7@@ X with an original 9-@@ a@@ b@@ r@@ e@@ ast 777 design .
The gain in unit costs is b@@ l@@ u@@ n@@ ted compared with 10-@@ a@@ b@@ r@@ e@@ ast now in use .
" The reason Boeing are doing this is to cra@@ m more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , " said Kevin Ken@@ iston , head of passenger comfort at Europe 's Airbus .
On the other hand , analysts say full 10-@@ s@@ e@@ at-@@ per-@@ row cab@@ ins for existing 77@@ 7s suggest many passengers are voting for the dens@@ er lay@@ out , which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares .
" E@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ teen inches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777 , " said cabin interiors expert Mary Kir@@ by , founder and editor of the Run@@ way Girl Network .
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .
G@@ l@@ o@@ b@@ e@@ -@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ ting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing lay@@ outs .
While boasting comfort , all builders also offer jets with high-@@ dens@@ ity lay@@ outs for low-cost airlines and regional travel .
Airbus offers a 10-@@ a@@ b@@ r@@ e@@ ast A@@ 350 but says it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus was s@@ t@@ ressing the need for more cabin custom@@ ization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets .
Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets , experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly , but could distract from a wave of 77@@ 7@@ X sales .
Oracle Shareholders A@@ n@@ g@@ r@@ y at Ellison Sal@@ ary
A majority of shareholders at Oracle voted against the proposed r@@ e@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ eration package for founder and managing director Larry Ellison on Thursday in view of his group 's financial performance .
The vote is not b@@ i@@ n@@ ding , but it does tar@@ n@@ ish the image of Ellison , the third rich@@ est man in the world , who is still rev@@ elling in his boat 's victory in the Americas Cup .
The multi@@ millionaire still holds 25 % of the capital in the software group he co-@@ founded 40 years ago .
Just last year , Ellison got a negative vote on his r@@ e@@ m@@ u@@ n@@ eration package .
The Oracle boss r@@ e@@ l@@ inqu@@ ished a $ 1.2 million bonus for the 2@@ 0@@ 13 financial year , which ended in May , because of the group 's poor performances . The group had failed to meet its growth targets , but he did pick up around $ 77 million linked to stock options .
His fixed salary is a nomin@@ al $ 1 .
Throughout the non-@@ calendar 2@@ 0@@ 13 fiscal year , Oracle 's net profit grew by 3.5 % , while its share price rose 27.@@ 5 % , o@@ u@@ t@@ performing the S & P@@ -@@ 500 index which grew 24 % in the same period .
New anti-@@ nicot@@ ine vaccine could take the pleasure out of smoking
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti-@@ nicot@@ ine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette .
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicot@@ ine a@@ d@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ tion for life .
Further tests are needed before starting human trials , which would take several years , but Professor Ronald C@@ r@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ al of W@@ e@@ ill Corn@@ ell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good .
" We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop , exhau@@ sting all the methods on the market today , but find their nicot@@ ine a@@ d@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ tion to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , " P@@ r@@ of Corn@@ ell said .
The new vaccine contains a h@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ less virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-@@ nicot@@ ine antibodies .
The virus selectively i@@ n@@ f@@ ects liver cells , which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies .
The antibodies hunt down any nicot@@ ine m@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ u@@ les in the blood@@ stream , neutr@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ ing them before they reached the brain , preventing a smoker from getting a nicot@@ ine hit .
In tests , vaccin@@ ated mice who were subsequently given nicot@@ ine continued with their normal activity .
But mice who had not been given the vaccine " c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ed out , " say the researchers , a sign that the nicot@@ ine had reached their b@@ r@@ ains .
The experiments are described in the journal Science Tran@@ sl@@ ational Medicine .
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .
The j@@ a@@ b@@ s had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels top@@ ped up that they proved expensive and i@@ m@@ practical .
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower , because it turns liver cells into antibody factories .
P@@ r@@ of C@@ r@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ al said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were temp@@ ted to try a cigarette , preventing nicot@@ ine a@@ d@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ tion .
But more likely it would be used by smo@@ kers to quit .
" They will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicot@@ ine vaccine , and that can help them kick the habit , " he said .
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed .
Dr@@ one Kills Pakistani Taliban Leader
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , H@@ a@@ k@@ i@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ lah Mehsud , was killed in an American d@@ r@@ one strike in Pakistan on Friday , according to security services .
H@@ a@@ k@@ i@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ lah Mehsud 's death has been announced several times before in the past .
However , intelligence personnel , army staff and political activists have confirmed this time that he has lost his life in the strike , which was carried out in the region of North Waziristan .
" We can confirm that H@@ a@@ k@@ i@@ m@@ u@@ l@@ lah Mehsud has been killed in a d@@ r@@ one strike , " said a senior security services official .
The previous day , the Pakistani Prime Minister , Nawaz Sharif , informed the British government on a trip to London that discussions had been initi@@ ated with T@@ e@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ k e Taliban Pakistan ( TT@@ P ) , the Pakistani Taliban movement .
Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di denies being influenced by O@@ b@@ e@@ id
Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di will be investig@@ ated by the state 's corruption watchdog .
Former NSW minister Joe Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di has denied changing mari@@ time leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie O@@ b@@ e@@ id , who had hidden interests in three properties on government@@ -@@ controlled land .
The Independent Commission Against C@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ u@@ ption ( ICA@@ C ) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr O@@ b@@ e@@ id l@@ o@@ b@@ b@@ i@@ ed several state ministers to have leases at Cir@@ cular Q@@ u@@ ay , where the O@@ b@@ e@@ ids owned two restaurants and a cafe , renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005 .
It 's now investigating allegations Mr Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di knew of Mr O@@ b@@ e@@ id 's secret interest in the properties , after evidence given by Mr Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di 's former deputy chief of staff , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ p@@ o@@ le , on Thursday .
During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender .
The l@@ esse@@ es were against this and also wanted longer terms .
In 2009 leases for the Cir@@ cular Q@@ u@@ ay enterprises , which earned the O@@ b@@ e@@ ids about $ 2.5 million annually , were renewed without going to public tender .
Mr Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di , who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009 , was initially in favour of public tend@@ ers .
But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr O@@ b@@ e@@ id , who Mr Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy .
A phone tran@@ script t@@ a@@ b@@ led in ICA@@ C showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ b@@ e@@ id , Mr Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di and Steve Dun@@ n , a senior bure@@ a@@ u@@ crat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr O@@ b@@ e@@ id in the fish@@ eries department .
" Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone convers@@ ations the development of the commercial lease policy , " Ass@@ istant Commissioner Anthony W@@ h@@ e@@ a@@ l@@ y asked Mr Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di .
" No , " Mr Tri@@ p@@ o@@ di replied .
I can 't remember what was discussed but it definitely wasn 't that .
D@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ ely not between myself and Mr O@@ b@@ e@@ id .
Israeli warplanes attack target inside Syria , official says
Israeli warplanes struck a target inside the Syrian port city of Lat@@ a@@ k@@ ia Thursday night , a senior administration official confir@@ ms to Fox News .
The official did not specify what the target was , but said there was at least one .
The Associated Press reports the target was R@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ made SA@@ -@@ 125 missiles .
At least twice earlier this year Israel launched airstrikes on shipments of missiles inside Syria .
Foreign workers on 4@@ 57 v@@ i@@ s@@ as could undergo " genu@@ i@@ n@@ eness " test
A " genu@@ i@@ n@@ eness " test for foreign workers on 4@@ 57 v@@ i@@ s@@ as is being considered by the government as it contempl@@ ates expanding a crackdown .
The test , if adopted , would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 45@@ 7s being used to fill u@@ n@@ skilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia .
A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Max@@ ine McK@@ ew slammed the government 's rhetoric about foreign workers , saying it could offend Australia 's neighbours .
" L@@ o@@ u@@ d declar@@ ations about ' foreigners getting to the back of the queue ' and ' Aussie jobs first ' are a very unple@@ asant t@@ h@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ back to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market , " she told the Australia India Institute today .
H@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ r@@ ically , that meant it was white lab@@ our that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echo@@ es of that historic a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ fact , I wouldn 't be surprised .
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bow@@ en .
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smu@@ ggling , has implemented five of the recommended changes with the r@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ der under consideration .
If the " genu@@ i@@ n@@ eness " criteria was adopted a visa a@@ p@@ p@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ant could be scru@@ tin@@ ised about " whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a r@@ e@@ l@@ ation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsor@@ ing business . "
Bus@@ inesses could also be required to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds .
Meanwhile , a 35-@@ year-old Sri L@@ ank@@ an asy@@ lum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asy@@ lum boat at Christmas Island this week .
The man 's d@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ ght nine-@@ year-old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comfor@@ ted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the vessel .
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .
A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS@@ 2 rail project has been announced by the UK government .
The work by HS@@ 2 Ltd suggests high-@@ speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2@@ 0@@ 26 .
Transport minister B@@ a@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ess K@@ ram@@ er said the project would " bring the UK together . "
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was " excited " to work with the UK government on the plan .
Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When Phase Two is completed , lines will run to Manchester and Leeds .
In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed link between London and the North of England from £ 32.@@ 7@@ bn to £ 4@@ 2@@ .@@ 6@@ bn .
The UK government , which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland , has instructed HS@@ 2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland .
This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less .
B@@ a@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ess K@@ ram@@ er said : " Our goal for HS@@ 2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together . "
We are driving forward HS@@ 2 because the benefits it will bring are huge .
Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network .
But it is also about conne@@ c@@ tivity , across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS@@ 2 .
Scottish Secretary Alistair C@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ el added : " Today 's announcement is good news for Scotland . "
For the Scottish government , Keith Brown called on Mr C@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ el to " unequi@@ voc@@ ally " back Scotland 's i@@ n@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion in the HS@@ 2 network .
Mr Brown said : " High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland , but also adds Scotland 's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain . "
So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland , creating benefit for all and c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ ement@@ ing the Gl@@ a@@ s@@ g@@ o@@ w@@ -@@ Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning .
I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps .
Air@@ craft electronic device rules to stay in force in Australia for now
Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their t@@ a@@ b@@ lets and smart phones during t@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ -@@ off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books , watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in " airplane " mode .
Pass@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it a@@ n@@ n@@ o@@ ying to be unable to access their e-books during t@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ -@@ offs and landings .
Australian carriers are looking at the decision , which requires US carriers to u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ take a massive amount of work to meet the requirements , but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures .
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emph@@ a@@ s@@ ised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia .
" C@@ ASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , " it said .
The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
Virgin , which has already been talking to C@@ ASA about ext@@ ending the use its in-@@ flight wi-fi entertainment system , was a@@ m@@ enable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regul@@ ator .
" We would welcome a review by C@@ ASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have ( wireless in-@@ flight entertainment ) on our planes , " a spokesman said .
Q@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ as said it would stick with the current rules for now .
" Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during t@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ -@@ off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that , " it said .
The FAA ruling applies to American airlines .
However , we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA 's decision and the reasons behind it .
For US carriers , the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will dep@@ end on the age of their fleet .
C@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ ers will need to prove their planes can tol@@ erate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise m@@ a@@ n@@ u@@ als , training materials , carr@@ y@@ -@@ on b@@ agg@@ age programs and passenger briefings .
" Once an airline v@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ fies the tol@@ erance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use h@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ held , light@@ weight electronic devices such as t@@ a@@ b@@ lets , e@@ -@@ readers , and smar@@ t@@ phon@@ es-@@ at all a@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ des , " the FAA said .
In rare instances of low visibility , the crew will instruc@@ t passengers to turn off their devices during landing .
The group also recommended that heav@@ ier devices should be safely s@@ t@@ owed under seats or in overhead bins during t@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ -@@ off and landing .
P@@ ia : At Least Four Injured in Vi@@ olent Skir@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ h
The small town of P@@ ia experienced an unusual height of fever on Thursday evening .

This day of Halloween , P@@ ia had a troubled evening marked by the outbreak of a bra@@ wl involving a number of people around the post office .

P@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ brokers s@@ h@@ ine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch
At a p@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ shop in B@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ m@@ eer shopping centre in Singapore , Jan@@ ani A@@ m@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ a is swapping a gold b@@ angle , ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters " school fees .
" My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money 's stuck there , " Mrs A@@ m@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ a says .
Even though she e@@ a@@ r@@ ns S $ 3,000 ( $ 2@@ ,@@ 400 ) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well , the monthly family income is insufficient , she says .
Indeed , such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that Val@@ u@@ e@@ Max , where she is carrying out her transaction , this week became the third p@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ shop to list on the Singapore stock exchange .
P@@ awning j@@ e@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S $ 1,300 in Ms A@@ m@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ a 's case - but almost as cheap as u@@ n@@ secured bank loans .
Ty@@ pic@@ ally p@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ brokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent , just above the 15.@@ 4 per cent offered at United Over@@ seas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .
However , p@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ brokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary , and can arrange loans faster than banks .
H@@ ence millions of people across the region are turning to p@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ shops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballo@@ oning household and consumer debt .
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies , l@@ o@@ w@@ e@@ r@@ - and middle-@@ income families are turning to pa@@ wn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .
This week Standard & Poor 's , the rating agency , cited increasing household leverage , mainly from rising mortgages , as a risk factor for Asian banks " credit@@ w@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ iness .
It said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product rati@@ os in Asia .
Malaysia top@@ ped the list at 80 per cent of GDP , up from 60 per cent in 2008 .
Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed continued export weakness , and a sof@@ tening in consumer demand .
" Bottom line is that with costs rising , people in the middle to lower end [ of the income scale ] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can , " says Song Seng W@@ un , economist at CI@@ M@@ B , a Malaysian bank .
H@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ r@@ ically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pa@@ wn personal belong@@ ings , as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family j@@ e@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ery .
In Singapore , about 70 per cent of items p@@ a@@ w@@ ned at the c@@ i@@ t@@ y@@ -@@ state 's 200 pa@@ wn outlets are gold .
People are saying " the gold price looks good , let 's pa@@ wn g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ ma 's gold chain and get it back next month .
In Thailand the largest p@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ shop operator , E@@ a@@ s@@ y@@ Money , has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months .
Such is the growth in the pa@@ wn business that Val@@ u@@ e@@ Max , operator of the o@@ u@@ t@@ let at B@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ m@@ eer and of 15 others like it in Singapore , plans to expand not only in n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ ing Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too , says Ye@@ ah Lee C@@ h@@ ing , Val@@ u@@ e@@ Max 's executive director .
The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S $ 66@@ m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange .
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates , Ms Ye@@ ah says that not only does p@@ awning offer cheaper rates than other lenders , it also does not add directly to debt .
" Customers are mortg@@ aging items that they already own , and m@@ o@@ n@@ e@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ ing personal assets does not increase household debt , " she says .
There 's an increased social accep@@ t@@ ance of p@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ b@@ r@@ o@@ king as a means to secure short term , secured financing .
Nor are the types of people who use p@@ a@@ w@@ n@@ brokers only the financi@@ ally s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ t@@ ched .
W@@ e@@ a@@ l@@ t@@ h@@ y people in Singapore also use Val@@ u@@ e@@ Max outlets , p@@ awning gold bars or Rolex watches , which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash .
We see customers from all walks of life .
" They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments , or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs , " says Ms Ye@@ ah .
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly .

Man W@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ ing Nazi Uniform C@@ h@@ ased Away from Super@@ market
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform with a swastika a@@ r@@ m@@ band was asked to leave a British supermarket following complaints by customers to the manager of the shop , who called the police , according to the shop on Friday .
" We received a number of complaints from customers , so we asked him to leave the shop , " explained a spokesperson for the A@@ s@@ da chain of supermarkets .
The shop called the police for assistance , but " by the time they arrived he had already left without making a scene , " she added .
" I was queu@@ ing when I saw a woman who seemed very upset .
People were f@@ l@@ a@@ b@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ gas@@ ted .

A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the act on his Tw@@ itter account , where he posted pictures of A@@ d@@ olf Hit@@ ler .
" I have been wearing a black SS a@@ r@@ m@@ band in A@@ s@@ da twice a week for three years , " claimed Paul D@@ u@@ t@@ ton , explaining that he was suffering from " mental problems . "
$ 3@@ 25@@ m rescue package for T@@ assie health
The Federal Government insists a $ 3@@ 25 million rescue package for Tas@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ia 's a@@ i@@ l@@ ing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can 't waste the funds .
Federal Health Minister Tanya P@@ liber@@ s@@ e@@ k has announced the Commonwealth is taking " urgent action " to head off a crisis caused by the island state 's aging population , higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints .
The funding , over four years , was decided after government consultations with Tas@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ an independent MP Andrew Wil@@ kie .
" The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state , " Ms P@@ liber@@ s@@ e@@ k said today .
The $ 3@@ 25 million package includes a $ 31 million e@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ tive surgery b@@ l@@ i@@ tz .
An additional 2@@ 600 operations including o@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ dic and c@@ a@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ act surgery will help clear a back@@ log .
There 's also money for walk-@@ in clin@@ ics in Hob@@ art and La@@ u@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ on , better after-@@ hospital care , medical specialist training , mental health services and the roll@@ out of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals .
" These investments respond to the ideas that front-@@ line clin@@ icians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tas@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ia 's health system , " Ms P@@ liber@@ s@@ e@@ k said .
The minister insisted the Tas@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ an Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime .
The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds .
A three-@@ person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wil@@ kie today said the $ 3@@ 25 million would count for little " unless it 's followed by genuine reform to put Tas@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ia 's public health system on a more sustain@@ able footing . "
He n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
" I 'm hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state 's public health system off the critical list , " Mr Wil@@ kie said .
According to the State Government these additional e@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ tive procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter D@@ u@@ t@@ ton believes today 's announcement is a " b@@ and-@@ aid solution . "
" The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $ 4@@ 30 million out of its health system , " he told ABC TV .
You can 't have a state government r@@ i@@ pping out almost half-@@ a@@ -@@ billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $ 300 million and pretend it 's a good news day .
Mr D@@ u@@ t@@ ton called on Ms P@@ liber@@ s@@ e@@ k to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bure@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ r@@ acy .

The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus ' chemical weapons by mid-@@ 2014 .
Des@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ ction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
However , Damascus still has to start destroying existing weapons and stock@@ piles .
The country is believed to have around 1,000 m@@ e@@ tric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the ner@@ ve agent sar@@ in .
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Saf@@ ira , which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites , reported the Brit@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ -based Syrian Ob@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ atory for Human Rights .
The activist group , which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria , said Thursday that 1@@ 20,@@ 296 people have died .
Of those , it said 6@@ 1,0@@ 67 are civilians , including 6@@ ,@@ 365 children .
On the government side , it said 2@@ 9,9@@ 54 are members of President Bash@@ ar Assad 's armed forces , 18,@@ 6@@ 78 are pro-@@ government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants .
Also among the dead it said were 2@@ ,@@ 202 army defe@@ ctors and some 5@@ ,@@ 375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
On July 25 , the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated that figure since .
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to fle@@ e the country .
Assad 's troops have been battling rebels , many of them linked to al-Qaida groups , in Saf@@ ira for weeks .
The Ob@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ atory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no speci@@ fics .
The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons ' inspectors face as they race against tight dead@@ lines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the mid@@ st of an ongoing civil war .
A statement from the OP@@ CW , which works closely with the United Nations , said its team was " now satisfied that it has v@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ fied - and seen destroyed - all of Syria 's declared critical production and mixing / filling equipment . "
It added that , " no further inspection activities are currently planned . "
Earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed their first round of v@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ fication work , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus .
They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns , the inspectors said .
On Thursday , OP@@ CW said the two locations were , according to Syria , " abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites , which were inspected . "
It was not immediately clear if the facility in Saf@@ ira was one of the two sites that OP@@ CW inspectors were not able to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OP@@ CW 's executive committee .
" I salu@@ te the f@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ de and courage you 've all demonstrated in f@@ u@@ l@@ filling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization , " the watchdog 's director-@@ general , Ah@@ met U@@ zum@@ c@@ u , said in comments released by the OP@@ CW .
Now in its third year , the civil war p@@ its the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad 's government and its security forces , which are stacked with members of his A@@ l@@ a@@ w@@ ite s@@ e@@ ct , an o@@ f@@ f@@ shoot of Shiite Islam .
In other developments , the Ob@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ atory 's chief R@@ a@@ m@@ i A@@ b@@ d@@ u@@ r@@ rahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria 's coastal province of Lat@@ a@@ k@@ ia .
The cause of the blast was not known , he said .
A@@ n@@ ger over Bali bomb p@@ l@@ o@@ t@@ ter 's sentence
Surviv@@ ors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the p@@ l@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ ers to face justice , saying U@@ mar P@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ k should face a firing squad .
P@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ k , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of S@@ o@@ u@@ th-@@ East Asia 's most wanted , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing .
He could be released within 15 years if granted p@@ a@@ r@@ o@@ le .
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night@@ clubs in the popular tourist area of Kut@@ a which left 202 people dead , including 88 Australians , and injured scores more .
He was also found guilty of a number of other t@@ e@@ r@@ r@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ m-@@ related charges , including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence , although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the " D@@ e@@ m@@ oli@@ tion Man " for his reputation as a master b@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ -@@ maker be sentenced to death .
The decision has r@@ e@@ ignited painful memories for Perth mother June C@@ o@@ r@@ teen , who lost her 39@@ -year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unle@@ ashed by P@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ k and his co-@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ spir@@ ators almost a decade ago .
Fighting back tears , she said P@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ k should have been sentenced to death .
I really feel that he should follow in the foot@@ steps of the other guys .
" He should be put in front of the firing squad , " Ms C@@ o@@ r@@ teen told AAP .
I have to live every day without seeing more grandchildren , and my daughters .
The Sari Club was levelled when a massive bomb loaded into a van p@@ a@@ r@@ ked outside was d@@ e@@ t@@ o@@ n@@ ated just after 11@@ pm on October 12 , 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar where a suicide bomber d@@ e@@ t@@ o@@ n@@ ated a back@@ pack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier .
He lap@@ sed into a month-@@ long coma in the wake of the bombing , and " died " three times while on life support .
Mr Hughes said P@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ k should have shared the same fate as three other members of the J@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ ah terror cell responsible for the carnage - A@@ m@@ r@@ o@@ z@@ i , Muk@@ h@@ las and I@@ m@@ a@@ m Sam@@ u@@ d@@ ra - who were executed four years ago .
Really , this guy should get the death penalty before anybody .
To keep him alive , well , there 's no reason to keep him alive .
To get 20 years , after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds , it 's not much .
P@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ k is the last of the Bali bombers to face justice .
He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually appreh@@ ended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of A@@ b@@ bott@@ abad , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later .
During the trial , an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed P@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ k was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to r@@ e@@ -@@ establish links between S@@ o@@ u@@ th-@@ East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .
" He didn 't give himself up , " Ms C@@ o@@ r@@ teen said .
Until just recently , he really didn 't feel sorry for how much grief he caused other people .
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year , which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia .
" There will be a lot of tears this year , " Ms C@@ o@@ r@@ teen said .
P@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ k may yet appeal his sentence .
FAA : Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes ( but not make cell phone calls )
Air@@ line passengers will be able to use their electronic devices g@@ ate-@@ to-@@ gate to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-@@ anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
But passengers shouldn 't expect changes to happen immediately .
How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline , FAA Administr@@ ator Michael H@@ u@@ e@@ r@@ ta said at a news conference .
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they 've updating their flight crew training m@@ a@@ n@@ u@@ als and rules for s@@ t@@ owing devices to reflect the new guidelines .
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of p@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ able electronic devices on planes .
Delta and JetBlue were among the a@@ i@@ r@@ liners who have already submitted plans .
" Dep@@ ending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , " the FAA said in a statement .
Currently , passengers are required to turn off their smar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ a@@ b@@ lets and other devices once a plane 's door closes .
They 're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead .
Pass@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ ends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground .
Under the new guidelines , airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs , landings and taxi@@ ing , the FAA said .
Most new a@@ i@@ r@@ liners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi@@ fi at higher a@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ des are expected to meet the criteria .
Laura Gl@@ ading , president of the Association of Professi@@ onal Flight Att@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ants , welcomed the changes .
" Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we 're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a w@@ i@@ n@@ -@@ win , " Gl@@ ading said in a statement .
We 're frankly tired of feeling like ' hall monitors ' when it comes to this issue .
But connecting to the Internet to s@@ u@@ r@@ f , exchange e@@ m@@ ails , text or download data will still be prohi@@ bited below 10,000 feet , the agency said .
Pass@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ers will be told to switch their smar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ a@@ b@@ lets and other devices to airplane mode .
So , still no Words With Friends , the online S@@ c@@ r@@ a@@ b@@ b@@ l@@ e@@ -@@ type game that actor Alec Bal@@ d@@ win was playing on his smar@@ tphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was p@@ a@@ r@@ ked at the gate .
And heav@@ ier devices such as lap@@ tops will continue to have to be s@@ t@@ owed because of concern they might i@@ n@@ j@@ ure someone if they go flying around the cabin .
I@@ n@@ -@@ flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohi@@ bited .
Reg@@ u@@ l@@ atory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission , not the FAA .
FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during t@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ off and landing
Last month , National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosen@@ ker , a CBS News national transportation safety expert , said that cell phones are still considered a risk .
" Cell phones , that really is an issue , not just because potentially it could create interference with n@@ a@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ ational devices , but we do know , according to the FCC , that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they 're in the air , " Rosen@@ ker said .
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .
Press@@ ure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCas@@ kill , D-@@ Mo . , contend there is no vali@@ d safety reason for the prohi@@ bitions .
The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubi@@ quit@@ ous .
Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .
The FAA began restric@@ ting passengers ' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radi@@ os , the high-tech gadgets of their day .
New a@@ i@@ r@@ liners are far more r@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ ant on electrical systems than previous gener@@ ations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference .
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cru@@ ising a@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ des to passengers for several years .
P@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ es modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference .
The vast majority of a@@ i@@ r@@ liners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines , H@@ u@@ e@@ r@@ ta said .
Today 's electronic devices generally e@@ m@@ it much lower power radio transmissions than previous gener@@ ations of devices .
E-@@ readers , for example , e@@ m@@ it only minimal transmissions when turning a page .
But transmissions are stronger when devices are down@@ loading or sending data .
Among those pressing for a relax@@ ation of restrictions on passengers ' use of the devices has been A@@ m@@ a@@ z@@ o@@ n@@ .com .
In 2011 , company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kind@@ le e@@ -@@ readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none .
FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk .
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air@@ line Pass@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal .
Other committee members said there are only anecdo@@ tal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old .
However , the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ ment landings in low visibility .
A travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ -@@ sense accommod@@ ations for a traveling public now b@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ling with technology .
" We 're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjo@@ yable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security , " said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .
Bird a@@ i@@ r@@ lifted to safety from North Sea rig released back into wild
A bird a@@ i@@ r@@ lifted a@@ s@@ h@@ ore after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild .
The water rail was put on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before being nur@@ sed back to health by the Scottish S@@ P@@ CA at its rescue centre in Alloa .
Centre manager Colin S@@ e@@ d@@ don said : " This water rail was likely a winter migr@@ ant from Northern Europe who got caught up in strong winds over the North Sea . "
It seems the bird became exhausted and managed to find refuge on the oil rig .
He added : " It was unable to fly off again so we were contacted for help . "
The water rail was fit and well by the time it was released .
Is Europe 's elite ready to do business with Britain ?
Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK 's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU .
To that end , we commis@@ sion@@ ed the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain , business and the EU .
You@@ G@@ o@@ v poll@@ ed over 1,000 business leaders , broad@@ ly representative of Britain 's business sizes , sectors and regions .
The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many .
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe , focusing on countries that are modern@@ ising and growing while the EU states s@@ t@@ a@@ g@@ n@@ ate .
They want to see the Government p@@ r@@ i@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ se new trading links with the likes of China , India and Brazil , rather than getting b@@ o@@ g@@ g@@ ed down in the long and a@@ r@@ d@@ u@@ ous process of r@@ e@@ forming the EU 's a@@ r@@ cane institutions .
When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key compe@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ ces should be returned to West@@ minster .
There was general discontent with the Sing@@ le Market , with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now o@@ u@@ t@@ weighed the benefits of being part of Europe 's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses , traditionally the most pro-@@ European of companies , agreed .
Finally , and most t@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ingly of all , our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade , not politics .
This finding , which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups , shows that business is pushing for a " meaningful change " that brings powers back to the UK .
The s@@ t@@ akes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt : this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegoti@@ ating the terms of Britain 's membership of the EU .
It also shows that business expects that renegoti@@ ation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK .
A better deal for British business is possible , and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embar@@ ks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and , as the findings of our poll show , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels " regulatory approach .
United States Dressed for Halloween
US President Obama celebrated the tradition of Halloween .
Yesterday evening , he and his wife handed out s@@ w@@ e@@ e@@ ts to hundreds of children invited to the g@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ ens of the White House in Washington .
Last year , Halloween f@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ ties on the east coast of the USA were canc@@ elled because Hurricane Sandy was on its way .

" Everyone is super-@@ excited , " said Andrea , one of the participants .
" I was able to wear the costume I had planned for last year . "
" Everyone is having a wild time , " added Rh@@ o@@ n@@ d@@ a .
" People are happy .

Gaz@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ m 's Alex@@ ei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria starts new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stre@@ am gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe 's largest energy projects , Gaz@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ m 's chief said .
" A landmark event has taken place today : Constru@@ ction started on the B@@ u@@ l@@ garian section of the South Stre@@ am gas pipeline , the most large-scale and important project in Europe , " Gaz@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ m Chairman Alex@@ ei Miller said in a statement Thursday .
This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent .
South Stre@@ am is meant to add diversity to Russia 's export routes through Europe .
A c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ actual dispute between Gaz@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ m and its counterparts in Ukraine , which hosts most of Russia 's gas for Europe , adds a layer of risk to conven@@ tional routes , officials say .
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means geo@@ political risks associated with transit countries are eliminated " fore@@ ver . "
B@@ u@@ l@@ garian consumers will receive gas from South Stre@@ am at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2@@ 0@@ 15 .
Gaz@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ m said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year 's end .
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trilli@@ on cubic feet of natural gas .
Pit@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ n to Cre@@ ate World 's Larg@@ est Marine Reserve
Pit@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ n Island is aiming to create the largest marine reserve in the world , daily newspaper Les N@@ o@@ u@@ v@@ e@@ l@@ les de T@@ a@@ h@@ iti announced on Thursday , following up on news from Radio Australia .
The island , which lies to the east of the G@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ er a@@ r@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ p@@ e@@ l@@ ago ( French Pol@@ yn@@ e@@ s@@ ia ) , is the last British territory in the South Pacific , halfway between New Zealand and Chile .
The territory measures 47@@ k@@ m@@ 2 , including three other small islands nearby .
It has been British since its occupation by the B@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ ty m@@ u@@ t@@ ine@@ ers , an episode in British mari@@ time history that has been turned into three Hollywood films .
Several dozen i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants , the majority of them d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ants of the B@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ ty m@@ u@@ t@@ ine@@ ers , still live on Pit@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ n , with 95 % of their income depending on the gener@@ os@@ ity of London .
The island 's Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the tiny a@@ r@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ p@@ e@@ l@@ ago . It will be 83@@ 6@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ k@@ m@@ 2 , correspon@@ ding to its exclusive economic zone .
An assistant to the mayor went to London to ask Great Britain to endor@@ se this request .
Mike Warren , the mayor of Pit@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ n , believes that the creation of such a protected zone would be the first step towards greater financial auton@@ omy for the island .
The project will need to be rati@@ fied by the British governor of Pit@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ n , who is based in New Zealand , and the British government .
Cre@@ ating such a reserve would permit the United Kingdom to protect the 83@@ 6@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ k@@ m@@ 2 , provided it has the means to ensure it is p@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ ced - which it does not .
There is no airport on Pit@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ n , making it impossible to base one or more a@@ i@@ r@@ cra@@ fts there to monitor the zone , and there is no port where military surveillance cra@@ fts can be placed .
France , on her part , already has to carry out the highly expensive aeri@@ al and mari@@ time surveillance of 5 million k@@ m@@ 2 of the E@@ E@@ Z of French Pol@@ yn@@ e@@ s@@ ia , adjacent to Pit@@ c@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ n .
The FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on airplanes - though c@@ h@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ ing on cellphones will still be prohi@@ bited .

Life Sent@@ ence for Former Chinese Vice-@@ Governor
A former vice-@@ governor of the province of J@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ n , in the northeast of China , sentenced to life imprison@@ ment for corruption on Friday .
Having been expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012 , T@@ ian X@@ u@@ e@@ r@@ en was accused of receiving 19 million yu@@ an in b@@ r@@ i@@ bes , according to media officials in China .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the vice-@@ governor , who was also president of the Bank of J@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ n , a public institution , helped businesses and managers win contracts , loans and promotions in exchange for money or gifts , the Primar@@ y I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ mediate Court in Beijing declared on its micro@@ blog .
President Xi J@@ i@@ n@@ ping , who took office last March , has made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon is a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party .
The head of state has promised that justice would be just as inflexi@@ ble with the powerful " tig@@ ers " as with the " flies " - the less@@ er officials - although just a handful of high-@@ ranking officials has been sentenced , including former executives of oil giant Petro@@ China .
The most recent high-profile case has been that of the former head of the CC@@ P in C@@ h@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ q@@ ing , B@@ o X@@ i@@ l@@ ai , who was sentenced to life in prison in September for corruption and power abuse . Previously his s@@ i@@ ghts were set on the highest offices in the state .
Nevertheless , the government has not declared any intention of r@@ e@@ forming its anti-@@ corruption system , for example by creating a body independent of the Party .
Two Y@@ M@@ CA employees charged with sex o@@ f@@ f@@ ences before allegations against Jonathan Lord , Royal Commission hears
Two Y@@ M@@ CA NSW employees had been charged with child sex o@@ f@@ f@@ ences before allegations were raised against C@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ b@@ ah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011 , the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard .
But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had " never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation , " the Commission was told .
Chief executive officer Philli@@ p H@@ are was asked about one case where a Y@@ M@@ CA employee was charged child pornography o@@ f@@ f@@ ences , and another when a gy@@ m i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ ctor at the Y@@ M@@ CA C@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ b@@ ah Hall was convicted of child sexual o@@ f@@ f@@ ences against children in his care in 1991 .
Mr H@@ are told G@@ ail Fur@@ ness , counsel a@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ing the Commission , he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one .
He conceded the Y@@ M@@ CA 's opening statement to the commission was also i@@ n@@ accur@@ ate in claiming " there have been external a@@ u@@ dits of the Y@@ M@@ CA that have recogn@@ ised the Y@@ M@@ CA as being at the fore@@ front of child safety . "
E@@ v@@ i@@ d@@ ence before the commission is that Y@@ M@@ CA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Comm@@ unities quality audit in August this year .
Mr H@@ are , who started with the Y@@ M@@ CA when he was 21 , conceded management " from myself down " failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches .
Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual o@@ f@@ f@@ ences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the Y@@ M@@ CA .
He was j@@ ailed for a minimum of six years .
But Mr H@@ are rejected the suggestion the Y@@ M@@ CA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord 's breaches of child safety .
Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children , bab@@ y@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ ting them privately , having them sit on his lap , saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone .
Dani@@ elle O@@ c@@ k@@ well , who was super@@ vised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour , testified she found the Y@@ M@@ CA C@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ b@@ ah children 's services manager Jac@@ q@@ u@@ i Barn@@ at who super@@ vised Lord " very intimid@@ ating and hard to approach a lot of the time . "
The CEO said he did not accept staff 's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting u@@ p@@ wards to their managers .
Rather , he said , their f@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ships with Lord clou@@ ded their j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ements about reporting him .
Mr H@@ are said he had provided his view to the Y@@ M@@ CA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the " Jonathan Lord incident " was " not about reporting " by staff , and the board agreed with him .
Mr H@@ are said the decision to get staff to sign confidenti@@ ality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by Y@@ M@@ CA general manager of children 's services L@@ i@@ am Whit@@ ley .
He said it was intended to avoid c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ m@@ ination of evidence but was " o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ze@@ alous " and poorly executed .
Y@@ M@@ CA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Sm@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ bone of Griff@@ ith University told the commission .
He said there were " serious problems " in recru@@ i@@ t@@ ment , screening , induction , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing adjourn@@ ed until December 20 .

Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bow@@ ler hats , he t@@ i@@ pped his flat cap at a ja@@ u@@ n@@ ty angle and p@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ ed two-@@ year-old T@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ee around the ring .
Fent@@ on was l@@ a@@ u@@ ded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years .
And T@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ee received top marks for his appearance and personality .
Fent@@ on was given T@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ee as a third birthday present last March and has p@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ sed with the S@@ h@@ e@@ t@@ land p@@ o@@ n@@ y every day since .
His mother Donn@@ a , 30 , said : " Fent@@ on and T@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ee are a great double act . "
They were up against all c@@ o@@ m@@ ers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and r@@ o@@ set@@ te .
It was only the second time he had compe@@ ted with T@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ee and we were all e@@ c@@ s@@ t@@ atic when he won .
Comple@@ te strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him .
The y@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ g@@ ster , from the village of N@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ y@@ g@@ l@@ o , near E@@ b@@ b@@ w Vale , South Wales , is following in the foot@@ steps of his aunt Sharon How@@ ells , who has been showing horses for more than 10 years .
Mrs How@@ ells said : " The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping . "
He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a m@@ a@@ r@@ v@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ous job .
Fent@@ on is animal mad - he loves horses , t@@ r@@ actors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after .
The way he has started he 'll be at the Hor@@ se of the Year show before long - and I 'm sure he 'll do well .
A spokesman for the annual horse show said : " Fent@@ on is only three but he knows how to handle his p@@ o@@ n@@ y . "
They are a great team together .
The judges marked Fent@@ on and T@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring .
They look for good team@@ work between the p@@ o@@ n@@ y and the h@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ ler - Fent@@ on and T@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ee were the best in the ring .
I 'm sure Fent@@ on was helped by his cute clothes , he really looked the part .
China plea paper ' to be overhau@@ l@@ e@@ d@@ '
A Chinese newspaper that made a front-@@ page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhau@@ led , a press regul@@ ator says .
The G@@ u@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ z@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ -based New E@@ x@@ press made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Y@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ z@@ h@@ ou .
But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken b@@ r@@ i@@ bes to fab@@ ric@@ ate stories about a part state-@@ owned company .
Now the New E@@ x@@ press is to undergo " full r@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ fication , " the regul@@ ator said .
The " r@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ fication " order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publi@@ c@@ ation , Radio , Film and Television .
A preliminary investigation showed that Y@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ g Even@@ ing News Group 's New E@@ x@@ press had published several untrue reports about listed company Zo@@ o@@ m@@ l@@ i@@ on in the period of September 2012 to August 2@@ 0@@ 13 .
" New E@@ x@@ press 's editorial management was d@@ i@@ s@@ ordered , " the regul@@ ator said in a statement .
It said it had decided to " impose an administrative penalty on Chen Y@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ z@@ h@@ ou by revo@@ king his reporter 's license . "
It had also " instructed Y@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ n@@ g Even@@ ing News Group to u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ take a complete r@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ fication of New E@@ x@@ press , and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New E@@ x@@ press and immediately revise New E@@ x@@ press 's leadership team . "
Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New E@@ x@@ press alleging financial i@@ r@@ regul@@ arities at a construc@@ tion-@@ equipment company called Zo@@ o@@ m@@ l@@ i@@ on .
After he was detained , his newspaper published two front-@@ page appeals for his release , saying it backed his journalism .
But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money .
" In this case I 've caused damages to Zo@@ o@@ m@@ l@@ i@@ on and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public 's trust , " he told state broad@@ caster CC@@ TV .
I did this mainly because I hank@@ ered after money and fame .
I 've r@@ e@@ alised my wrong@@ doing .
Following Mr Chen 's apology , New E@@ x@@ press issued a front-@@ page apology , saying it had failed to properly check his reports .
Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently .
Experts say confessions are still routinely c@@ o@@ e@@ r@@ ced , despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to i@@ n@@ crimin@@ ate themselves .
C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ les@@ -@@ de-@@ Gaul@@ le Air@@ craft C@@ a@@ r@@ rier " U@@ n@@ available "
The aircraft carrier has been left high and dry in Toul@@ on .
A l@@ e@@ ak of radioactive steam , detected on one of the two nuclear sto@@ k@@ e@@ holds on the C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ les@@ -@@ de-@@ Gaul@@ le in mid-@@ October when the ship was at sea , " posed no threat to the sailors , " but is no small matter for the Navy .
" La Roy@@ ale " - the French Navy - has just c@@ o@@ n@@ formed that the ship will be " unavailable until mid-@@ November " to allow " time to carry out the c@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ tive measures required " on the reactor .
Speci@@ alist naval defence company D@@ CN@@ S has confirmed that its teams , along with Are@@ va 's , have been d@@ i@@ s@@ pat@@ ched to the department of V@@ ar and are " currently working on aircraft carrier . "
Their tasks include changing a pump on the f@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ ty sto@@ k@@ e@@ hold .
" Everything has been put in place to enable the C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ les@@ -@@ de-@@ Gaul@@ le to be deployed as planned at the end of 2@@ 0@@ 13 , " explains D@@ CN@@ S .
And the Navy a@@ s@@ s@@ ures that " this has in no way delayed the [ nucle@@ a@@ r@@ -@@ powered ] ship 's activity schedule . "
It should be recalled that the C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ les@@ -@@ de-@@ Gaul@@ le had just returned from a six-@@ month period of interim maintenance .
It had cast off from Toul@@ on in mid-@@ October for a training exercise ,
p@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ally for the qualification of new fighter pilots .
A " small amount of damage , " c@@ o@@ n@@ fined to the area of the reactor chamber , then occurred on the French fleet 's flagship .
According to the Navy , the crew was not exposed to any radioactive c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ m@@ ination .
For more than a year , I have been notic@@ ing the strong dissatisfaction of people I meet everywhere : the hor@@ rend@@ ous r@@ e@@ valu@@ ation of their properties , a del@@ u@@ ge of taxes , the costs of all sorts of permits , e@@ n@@ d@@ less administrative fees , e@@ t@@ c .
In short , the limit@@ less s@@ i@@ p@@ h@@ oning of money from our p@@ o@@ c@@ kets .
Millions of squ@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ ered dollars could be saved by intro@@ duc@@ ing a tax system that is much more respect@@ ful of the taxpayers .
Money f@@ o@@ r@@ c@@ i@@ bly raised from taxpayers redu@@ ces their d@@ i@@ s@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ able income and contribu@@ tes to their i@@ m@@ p@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ment .
In S@@ h@@ a@@ w@@ i@@ n@@ igan , despite the closure of every major business , there is no embarrassment about the extravagant expenditure and the maintenance of white eleph@@ ants , such as the unprofitable cultural centre , the huge subsidies for the C@@ i@@ t@@ é de l '@@ É@@ ner@@ g@@ i@@ e , e@@ t@@ c .
These facilities are not profitable , so they should be sold to private businesses or demolished .
It is also dist@@ ressing to note the compul@@ sory purchase of numerous properties to make way for a major industrial complex which never arrived .
However , I do make hon@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ able mention of the transformation of the former W@@ a@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ o into a sort of industrial i@@ n@@ cub@@ ator , but at what cost to the taxpayers ?
It is not up to the public pur@@ se to invest in such projects , but to the private sector based on consumer demand .
The town@@ s@@ folk have been pleased to learn that L@@ ac à la P@@ ê@@ che and L@@ ac des P@@ i@@ l@@ es will continue to supply the town with p@@ o@@ table water .
Following the departure of all the industries ( major consumers of water ) and the big decline in the population , the use of water throughout the district has considerably reduced .
While this does not call for was@@ t@@ age , the town will never be short of water , and the severe regulation of its use may be ton@@ ed down significantly .
In a nut@@ shell , it is easy to do great things with other people 's money .
I would be a@@ s@@ h@@ amed to defend such a balance sheet .
With a gross debt of over $ 200 million , this town is no longer even capable of buying a pen without passing a loan b@@ y@@ e@@ -@@ law .
For over 40 years we have been run largely by suits with m@@ a@@ r@@ v@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ous qualifications . I do not believe that a sheep farmer would do any worse .
US-@@ Mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found
One of the most sophisticated drug smu@@ ggling tun@@ n@@ els between the USA and Mexico has been found , complete with its own lighting , v@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ l@@ ation and electric rail systems .
US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered .
The tunnel , which zigz@@ ags the length of nearly six football pitches , links w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses near Ti@@ juana , Mexico and San Diego , USA .
The area is filled with non@@ descri@@ pt w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses , making it easier to conce@@ al trucks being loaded with drugs .
The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through u@@ n@@ detected , authorities said .
Authorities seized eight-@@ and-a-@@ half tons of marijuana and 3@@ 27 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel 's discovery , according to court records .
Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute .
They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprison@@ ment if convicted .
In N@@ o@@ g@@ ales , Arizona , smu@@ g@@ g@@ l@@ ers tap into vast underground drainage canals .
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .
Some of the largest tun@@ n@@ els have been discovered after central Mexico 's marijuana harvest in October , which presents drug c@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ els with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers .
In 2010 , authorities found a roughly 7@@ 00-@@ yard passage equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a Ti@@ juana home to two San Diego w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses .
British police serve Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge with extra@@ dition notice
B@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ h police served an extra@@ dition notice today on Wiki@@ L@@ e@@ aks founder Juli@@ an Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge , who has taken refuge in Ecuador 's embassy in London and requested asy@@ lum .
Scotland Y@@ ard said they had served a " surrender notice " on the 40-year-old Australian requiring him to appear at a police station , adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest .
Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge faces extra@@ dition to Sweden over sex crime allegations , having exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ turned his appeal against extra@@ dition earlier this month .
Fear@@ ing Stockholm would pass him on to the US , he sought refuge at Ecuador 's embassy in London on June 19 , asking the South American country for political asy@@ lum .
Scotland Y@@ ard has " served a surrender notice upon a 40-year-old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing , " a spokesman said .
He remains in breach of his bail conditions .
The embassy declined to comment on the serving of the police notice .
Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge fears he will be e@@ x@@ trad@@ ited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espi@@ onage charges , after releasing more than 25@@ 0,000 US diplomatic cables on the Wiki@@ L@@ e@@ aks anti-@@ secrecy website .
How B@@ i@@ o@@ m@@ etric@@ s Will Inv@@ ade Our Lives
Is it the end of passwords to access a smar@@ tphone or pay for purchases ?
US , French and Japanese researchers are predic@@ ting a future where we will be recogn@@ ised by biom@@ etric sens@@ ors on telep@@ hones and computers .
Bernard Didier , vice-president of Mor@@ p@@ h@@ o , believes this will be the " century of biom@@ etric@@ s . "
B@@ i@@ o@@ m@@ etric@@ s will be the only way of guaranteeing the identity of an individual carrying out transactions in a world as t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ se and t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ national as the Internet .
Organ@@ i@@ s@@ ations devoted to privacy protection note this fas@@ c@@ i@@ n@@ ation for biom@@ etric@@ s , but are concerned .
In France alone in 2011 , the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liber@@ ties author@@ ised 774 i@@ m@@ print recognition systems , for recogn@@ ising finger@@ prints , the shape of the hand or networks of v@@ e@@ ins in the hand , for businesses , institutions , caf@@ e@@ t@@ eri@@ as , e@@ t@@ c .
" Everyone will soon be identifi@@ able , anywhere and any time , " says a concerned Justin Brook@@ man , consumer privacy director for the CD@@ T ( Center for Democracy and Technology ) in Washington .
But why such optimism for some and pessimis@@ m for others ?
B@@ i@@ o@@ m@@ etric@@ s will rely on new technologies that will enable new services to be provided to citizens and consumers .
In France today , the most commonly used biom@@ etric data are finger@@ prints , hand geom@@ etry and the network of v@@ e@@ ins in the palm or fingers .
But each of these techniques has its limitations .
" For example , people who work with cement have damage to their fingers that rend@@ ers their finger@@ prints u@@ n@@ read@@ able , " notes P@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ppe Robin , technical director for identification at Thales Communications & Security .
Fur@@ thermore , the d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ction and v@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ fication of a network of v@@ e@@ ins or of hand geom@@ etry require a voluntary and specific gesture on the part of individuals .
It is both a security mechan@@ ism - this data cannot be captured without people knowing - and an i@@ n@@ conven@@ i@@ ence - the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and so takes time .
As a c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ e@@ q@@ u@@ ence , research has been conducted over the past twenty years into other methods , such as face or i@@ r@@ is recognition ( the coloured part of the eye ) .
Thanks to the improved precision of the sens@@ ors and the calcul@@ ating capacity of the computers used to analy@@ se this data , these techniques are becoming practical .
The accuracy of face recognition has improved t@@ e@@ n@@ fold over the past five years , considers Cy@@ r@@ ille Bat@@ aller , R & D laboratory director at Acc@@ enture in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automated passport gates that use face recognition .
It is now possible to identify a moving face or i@@ r@@ is .
" Today we are carrying out research into voice and g@@ a@@ i@@ t recognition using son@@ ic sens@@ ors , but it requires a silent environment , " says S@@ r@@ i@@ dh@@ ar Ly@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ ar , director of security research at Intel Lab@@ s .
DNA , a unique and u@@ n@@ falsi@@ fiable marker , also a@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ ses hope and concern .
" With the current state of knowledge , it could be considered the ultimate in biom@@ etric data , " confir@@ ms S@@ ophi@@ e Vul@@ l@@ i@@ et-@@ T@@ a@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ i@@ er , director of research , innovation and forec@@ a@@ s@@ ting at the CN@@ I@@ L .
But DNA analysis still takes a long time and is expensive .
NE@@ C is offering the judicial police a p@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ able pack costing 90,000 euros that can analy@@ se DNA s@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ les on a crime scene within an hour .
The uses of biom@@ etric@@ s fall into two groups : identification ( recognition of one person among@@ st others ) and authenti@@ c@@ ation ( confirmation that a person is who they say they are ) .
Until now , identification has c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ isted of the provision of identity papers : biom@@ etric systems ( finger@@ prints , photos , i@@ r@@ is , e@@ t@@ c . ) will have to be given access to information that the state holds on every citiz@@ en already on file .
This will provide assurance that someone is not trying to u@@ s@@ u@@ r@@ p the identity of another .
This principle of comparison can be used for other purposes .
NE@@ C is therefore proposing VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or store .
" We are gathering images from surveillance cameras and comparing them with photos of celebri@@ ties that are freely available on the Internet , " explains D@@ any N@@ assi@@ f , business development director for biom@@ etric identification solutions at NE@@ C France .
Another use is to take a photo of someone queu@@ ing in a shop , follow his progress using face recognition and work out the waiting time .
Auth@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ ation initially concerned physical ( at borders , in protected locations , in a caf@@ eter@@ ia e@@ t@@ c . ) or digital presence ( logging on to a computer ) .
A@@ d@@ ded to this , more recently , are presence checks .
" A biom@@ etric time@@ keeper prevents the situation where one colleague c@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ks in on behalf of another , " asser@@ ts Cy@@ r@@ ille Bat@@ aller from Acc@@ enture .
But , more and more , authenti@@ c@@ ation will also involve transactions , in particular those carried out using devices connected to the Internet .
In Japan , it is already possible to withdraw money from some cash machines by inser@@ ting your card and placing your hand on a biom@@ etric reader : this gesture replaces the use of a P@@ IN .
A similar technique is being tested at Vill@@ e@@ n@@ e@@ u@@ ve-@@ d '@@ Asc@@ q and in A@@ n@@ g@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ ê@@ me by the company Natural Security , in partnership with banks and major retailers : at the point of paying with a card in a shop , the customer does not enter a code - they place a finger in a reader , which scans the v@@ e@@ ins .
The exper@@ iment is expected to last six months .
If it is conclu@@ sive , biom@@ etric readers could soon be seen in shops in France .
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biom@@ etric@@ s appealing to the general public .
The first is to explain how it can save time .
" If a customer spends thir@@ ty seconds less at a t@@ i@@ l@@ l thanks to biom@@ etric@@ s , it would be nice , " says the manager of a major store .
The second is to offer person@@ alised services : in a few years a voice server will be able to recognise your voice and offer you custom@@ ised options .
Finally , the public can be r@@ e@@ assured by highlighting the measures implemented to protect databases .
" Digital finger@@ prints are stored in a primary server ; the identities of individuals are in a second database . The correlation between the two sets of information is e@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ p@@ ted and stored in a highly secure box , which l@@ o@@ c@@ ks up if anyone tries to move it , " speci@@ fies P@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ppe Robin from Thales .
However , given the lack of in-@@ depth studies , it is impossible to know if this line will really convince users .
Priv@@ acy protection specialists continue to be concerned .
" The advances in face recognition , the increase in the number of surveillance cameras and the huge number of photos available on Facebook , F@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ r or Pic@@ a@@ s@@ a make me fear the worst : widespread surveillance , " predic@@ ts Andrew Patrick from the Office of the Priv@@ acy Commissioner in Canada .
Driver speeding at 13@@ 0@@ mph with hot drink between legs fined £ 1,000
A motor@@ ist has been fined £ 1,000 for driving at up to 13@@ 0@@ mph ( 210@@ km / h ) with a hot drink balanced between his legs .
Andrew How@@ ie , 35 , of Ti@@ p@@ tree , Essex , was spotted driving his Mercedes B@@ e@@ n@@ z on the A@@ 120 at B@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ tree on 27 May .
When police stopped him they discovered the t@@ a@@ k@@ e@@ away drink between his legs .
At Colchester Mag@@ istr@@ ates ' Court How@@ ie admitted a charge of driving without due care and attention .
Seven points added to his licence resulted in him receiving a six-@@ month driving ban .
How@@ ie was also ordered to pay costs of £ 90 and a victim s@@ u@@ r@@ charge of £ 100 .
Tax on foreign property owners to burst London 's b@@ u@@ b@@ ble
The Treasury have p@@ r@@ o@@ visi@@ onally c@@ o@@ sted out the CG@@ T measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 Budget , introduced a 7 % rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £ 2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals .
Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the b@@ o@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ ghs of West@@ minster and Kens@@ ington & Chelsea , which stood at £ 708 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North East , North West and Yorkshire and the Hum@@ ber put together .
Mr Cook said : " Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ ance legislation , it is very difficult to argue that high value property is u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ -@@ tax@@ ed irrespective of the effect of the out-@@ dated council tax system . "
" But this move could make some foreign investors retic@@ ent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell , " he added .
Prime property - the top 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price - in the affluent s@@ o@@ u@@ th-@@ west London belt , which stretches from Ful@@ ham to Wimbledon , has increased by a record 11.@@ 8 % over the past year .
Prices in central London continued to show steady y@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ -@@ o@@ n@@ -@@ year growth of 5.@@ 6 % but were overshadowed by a burgeoning " domestic market " with the city 's south west , north ( 7@@ .@@ 4 % ) and east ( 6.@@ 5 % ) all experiencing an uptick , according to research from Sav@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ s .
Scienti@@ sts have shed more light on how the movements of a dog 's tail are linked to its mood .
Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs w@@ ag their tails more to the right ( from the dog 's point of view ) , while nervous dogs have a left-@@ dominated s@@ w@@ ish .
But now scientists say that fellow c@@ a@@ n@@ ines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences .
P@@ r@@ of G@@ e@@ o@@ r@@ gio Vall@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ a , a neur@@ o@@ scientist from the University of T@@ rento , said : " It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ently involved in stimul@@ i that invo@@ kes positive or negative emo@@ tions . "
Here we attempted to look at it in other species .
He added that just as in humans , for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice v@@ e@@ r@@ sa , and the two hem@@ isph@@ eres played different roles in emo@@ tions .
To find out more about how dogs react to the l@@ o@@ p-@@ sided tail w@@ ags of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs .
They measured the pets ' heart rates and analy@@ sed their behaviour .
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other
P@@ r@@ of Vall@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ a said : " We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a natur@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ stic version or a silhou@@ ette to get rid of any other c@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ ounding issues , and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right . "
When the animals saw an otherwise expres@@ sion@@ less dog move its tail to the right ( from the tail@@ -@@ w@@ agging dog 's point of view ) , they stayed perfectly relax@@ ed .
But when they spotted a tail v@@ e@@ er predominantly to the left ( again from the tail@@ -@@ s@@ w@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ing dog 's point of view ) , their heart rates picked up and they looked a@@ n@@ x@@ i@@ ous .
P@@ r@@ of Vall@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ a said he didn 't think that the dogs were intentionally communic@@ ating with each other through these movements .
Instead , he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn 't feel worried about .
He said : " If you have several meetings with other dogs , and frequently their tail w@@ agging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour , and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of that experience . "
The researchers say the findings could give owners , vets and trainers a better insight into their animal 's emo@@ tions .
Dog behaviour expert John Brad@@ s@@ h@@ aw , a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol 's school of v@@ eter@@ i@@ n@@ ary science , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to c@@ a@@ n@@ ines .
Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .
And in another research paper from the University of Victori@@ a in Canada , he said : " Dog@@ s were more likely to approach a robot dog when its ' tail ' was made to w@@ ag left rather than right , rather than becoming a@@ n@@ x@@ i@@ ous - the opposite way around to the Italian study . "
He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpre@@ ting the animals in the films or robo@@ -@@ dogs as c@@ a@@ n@@ ines .
A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help , he explained .
" While there is considerable evidence from many different mamm@@ als that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still has to be ham@@ mered out - and dogs are no exception , " he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded , it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other .
Arctic Monkeys post@@ p@@ one Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner 's illness
Rock band the Arctic Monkeys have post@@ poned a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer was diagno@@ sed with lar@@ yn@@ g@@ i@@ tis .
The Sheffield group were scheduled to perform at the Hy@@ d@@ r@@ o venue in the city on Friday .
However , lead singer Alex Turner 's illness has forced them to r@@ e@@ s@@ ched@@ u@@ le the show .
The band 's announcement came after they were forced to similarly post@@ p@@ one a gig at the L@@ G Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .
In a statement on their official website , the Arctic Monkeys said : " Following the decision to post@@ p@@ one the show at the Birmingham L@@ G Arena tonight and after seeking medical advice , Arctic Monkeys must also post@@ p@@ one the show at the Glasgow Hy@@ d@@ r@@ o on Friday , November 1 . "
" Alex Turner has been diagno@@ sed with lar@@ yn@@ g@@ i@@ tis and is r@@ e@@ g@@ r@@ e@@ t@@ t@@ ably not able to perform . "
The show at the L@@ G Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20 and the show at the Glasgow Hy@@ d@@ r@@ o will now take place on November 21 .
All tickets remain vali@@ d for these shows .

Pope Francis to name first cardin@@ als in February
Pope Francis will create new cardin@@ als of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22 , the Vatican announced Thursday .
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope , and they 're the ones who elect p@@ o@@ pes , so Francis will be a@@ p@@ p@@ o@@ i@@ n@@ ting his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor .
There are now 2@@ 0@@ 1 cardin@@ als .
However , once a cardin@@ al reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 " cardin@@ al elect@@ ors . "
In a statement announcing the news , F@@ a@@ ther Feder@@ ico L@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ di , a Vatican spokesman , said a meeting of all the existing cardin@@ als would be held before the ceremony to elev@@ ate the new cardin@@ als , known as a consist@@ ory .
" Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to c@@ o@@ n@@ v@@ o@@ ke February 's consist@@ ory in advance in order to facili@@ tate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardin@@ als from different parts of the world , " L@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ di said .
Jack Val@@ ero of Catholic Vo@@ ices said that by February , the number of cardin@@ al elect@@ ors was likely to have dropped .
He said usually a pope would name as many cardin@@ als as was needed to raise the number of cardin@@ al elect@@ ors back to 120 and as many cardin@@ als aged over 80 as he wanted .
Next year 's consist@@ ory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year , Val@@ ero said .
At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy .
" It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nomin@@ ate cardin@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balance , " he said .
F@@ o@@ r@@ ty percent of Roman Cath@@ olic@@ s are in South America , but they have a tiny number of cardin@@ als .
The cardin@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals , a group of eight cardin@@ als from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church .
In the past the Pope decided everything on his own .
" Now Francis has selected these eight cardin@@ als to help him , " Val@@ ero said .
He said it was " quite possible " that Francis would ask the cardin@@ als for advice .
But we 've not been in that situation before -- it 's all completely new .

GM recalls some new pickup trucks in U.S. to fix s@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 1@@ 9@@ ,000 of its all-@@ new 2014 Che@@ vr@@ olet Sil@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ado and G@@ M@@ C Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclin@@ ing seatback , according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday .
On some of the trucks , the front seats may have a d@@ e@@ f@@ ect in the reclin@@ ing mechan@@ ism .
As a result , the s@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ backs fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head r@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ aints .
" If the vehicle is struck from behind , the head restraint may not properly protect occupants , increasing the risk of injury , " according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website .
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10 .
GM 's truck roll@@ -@@ out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring .
GM told truck owners about the d@@ e@@ f@@ ect in the first half of October .
NH@@ TSA could not review the owner noti@@ fication letter due to the 16-@@ day government shutdown , which t@@ e@@ m@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ ed auto sales growth in October .
Sales of the Sil@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ado and Sierra trucks , which were redesigned for the 2014 model year , were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year , GM said on Friday .
In October , GM sold 4@@ 2,6@@ 60 Sil@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ado and 16,@@ 5@@ 03 Sierra pickup trucks .
GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $ 3@@ 7@@ .@@ 47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon .
Worker Dies Bur@@ i@@ ed Under Concrete Blocks
A construction worker died after being buried under dozens of concrete blocks in Montreal on Thursday afternoon .
The tragedy occurred at around 11@@ am on Rue Marquette , near the j@@ u@@ n@@ ction with Rue Beau@@ b@@ i@@ en , in the district of Rosem@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ La P@@ e@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ -@@ Patri@@ e .
By all accounts , foundation work had been going on at the site for some time .
A shared foundation wall had just been e@@ r@@ e@@ cted in the past few days .
The accident occurred just after the victim had arrived on site to collect his tools .
" I was going past in my car when I saw the wall collapse , creating a huge cloud of dust , " said Syl@@ v@@ ain Jean , who lives near the site .
" I got out and went to remove the large blocks that were covering him .
Only part of his back was visible , it 's really sad . "
According to the authorities , the victim is a man in his fif@@ ties , who worked for a f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ work company .
Att@@ e@@ m@@ p@@ ts at resusc@@ itation were made by the emergency services , but without success .
The man succumbed to his serious injuries .
An inspector from the Occu@@ pational Health and Safety Commission was d@@ i@@ s@@ pat@@ ched to the site to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy .
An Obama voter 's cry of despair
I voted for President Obama twice , sharing hope in possibility of change
He says Obama has had worthy efforts t@@ h@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ ted by GOP obstruc@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ ism
Ob@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ ism can 't excuse Ob@@ a@@ m@@ a@@ c@@ are website wo@@ es , d@@ r@@ one attacks
Obama 's 2008 campaign mem@@ o@@ ir is a sad reminder of what might have been
N@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ el P. Morris is a second-@@ year student at Harvard Medical School .
I 'm reading a terri@@ bly sad book these days .
It 's a book that I thought would u@@ p@@ lift me during the dol@@ d@@ r@@ ums of second-@@ year medical school , and renew in me a sense of hope .
It 's called " The Aud@@ acity to Win , " and it 's a mem@@ o@@ ir of Barack Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign .
When I 'm finished with my patient w@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ -@@ u@@ ps at night and get into bed , the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away .
The election turned out to be a land@@ slide , and news anch@@ ors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour .
My classmates cried with joy , and my parents saved every newspaper they could find .
A young team of visi@@ o@@ n@@ aries was headed for the White House , and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama 's transition to office in 2008 , he had an 82 % approval rating .
And then I close the book .
Cut@@ ting to the present is a rude awakening , like snapping out of a dream .
It 's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory , a sad reminder of opportunities gone by .
Change indeed happened , in the years since I cast my first ballot .
It was simply nothing I could have imagined .
I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments , from the passage of the Aff@@ ordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq , the end of " don 't ask don 't tell , " to the killing of Osama bin Laden .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , I believe that p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ san obstruc@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ ism has u@@ p@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ed too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at Guant@@ anamo Bay , among others .
But , after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers , I 've reached a limit to the e@@ x@@ plan@@ ations that I can provide .
I 've reached a point of political despair .
Republican obstruc@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ ism cannot explain allowing the b@@ u@@ gging of foreign leaders , nor having d@@ r@@ ones strike innocent children overseas .
It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans , nor prosecu@@ ting whist@@ l@@ e@@ -@@ blow@@ ers who reveal government wrong@@ doing .
It cannot account for assassin@@ ating A@@ n@@ war a@@ l@@ -@@ A@@ w@@ l@@ aki , an American citiz@@ en , without a trial , nor s@@ h@@ i@@ r@@ king public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House 's efforts to silence the media are the " most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration . "
And , most recently , it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Aff@@ ordable Care Act was signed into law .
I don 't know if this is what I should have expected .
If , at 18 years old , I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradic@@ t the political campaigns that precede it .
Obviously , e@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ tive office isn 't a predic@@ table course , as the opposing political party and random events , such as the New@@ town massacre , will shape our public conversation .
Yet , of all of the examples that I have listed above , they largely seem to be of the administration 's own choosing .
That is what troubles me most of all .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was excited by his candidacy .
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and u@@ n@@ refin@@ ed alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions .
I felt that a second term for Obama , free from the pressures of future elections , would f@@ u@@ l@@ fill the hope that we had heard of for so long .
Still , as Obama 's approval rating sank below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder .
It makes me year@@ n for the many promises that disappeared .
This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary .
At a post-mortem campaign meeting , he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause .
" I want us to get our m@@ o@@ jo back , " he said .
We 've got to remember who we are . ' 
It 's five years later , Mr. President , and I couldn 't agree with you more .
The opinions expressed in this comment@@ ary are solely those of N@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ el Morris .

Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbot@@ t has conflict of interest over parental leave scheme
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbot@@ t has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it .
The mining magnate , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill , made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict .
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that may be crucial in deci@@ ding if the carbon and mining taxes are ax@@ ed .
But Mr Palmer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said Mr Abbot@@ t 's daughters stood to personally benefit from policies .
" He 's got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of those daughters get pregnant , he 'll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not , " Mr Palmer said .
Two months after the election , the electoral commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the S@@ u@@ n@@ s@@ h@@ ine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes , after a r@@ e@@ c@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ t .
Mr Palmer called for overhaul of election counting to speed up the process .
Tony Abbot@@ t 's daughters Frances and Bridget .
Should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting ?
" We need to have a better system , " he said .
Why is it that we shouldn 't have a system where you can walk in , punch your details into a computer , vote immediately and have a result at 6.@@ 30 that night ?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of p@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ ils to mark ballots .
Is it because they can rub out the result if someone doesn 't like it ?
In this day and age having a pen@@ c@@ i@@ l seems extraordinary .
The E@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ oral Commission has been studying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand .
Mr Palmer , 59 , said his policies included an international airport for the S@@ u@@ n@@ s@@ h@@ ine Coast and he would take " very seriously " his new job .
Public office is about public service .
" We seek no reward , except the reward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community , " he said .
A team of biologists working for the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new humpback dol@@ p@@ h@@ in species living off the northern coast of Australia .
Thi@@ b@@ aut B@@ o@@ u@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ oux , in charge of the scientific mission at the Ob@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ a@@ t@@ o@@ ire p@@ our la Conservation et l '@@ E@@ t@@ u@@ de des A@@ n@@ i@@ m@@ aux et Mili@@ e@@ u@@ x M@@ a@@ r@@ ins ( O@@ CE@@ AM@@ M ) , discussed this discovery with L '@@ E@@ x@@ press and explains the long process of i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ fying new species .
Did the discovery of this new humpback dol@@ p@@ h@@ in species surprise you ?
It 's good news , but it didn 't surprise me especially .
In the past , species have been described and identified on the basis of morph@@ ology , a@@ n@@ a@@ t@@ omy and geo@@ graph@@ y . Today , the development of new tools such as gene@@ tics enables us to improve our knowledge of the science of the c@@ l@@ assi@@ fication of species .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , there is a possibility that these advances in gene@@ tics and m@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ cular b@@ i@@ ology may call into question the c@@ l@@ assi@@ fication or belonging of a species to a particular g@@ e@@ n@@ us , family or even order .
In the early 19th century , morph@@ ologists classified animals on the basis of the morph@@ ological differences between species .
Today , some of these c@@ l@@ assi@@ fications have been questioned as a result of advances in gene@@ tics .
L@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ wise , two species that are very similar in morph@@ ology were distingu@@ ished using gene@@ tics .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
About a decade ago , scientists recogn@@ ised two species that belong@@ ed to this sub-@@ family : Pacific humpback dol@@ phins and Atlantic humpback whales .
Rec@@ ent analyses have enab@@ led four species to be distingu@@ ished .
Why is this a significant discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society says ?
From the point of view of conservation , it is essential to be aware of genetic differences so a species and , thus , its genetic vari@@ ability can be protected .
Researchers have known about this population for a long time , but they did not know that it was part of a new species that only lives in this location .
H@@ ence , in the event of large-scale m@@ o@@ r@@ tali@@ ty in the region , caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture , we would know that we are dealing with the ext@@ i@@ n@@ ction of a species rather than the local disappearance of a population belonging to a much more widespread species .
Such loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered based on the number of its members alive on the planet , known as the stock , and of the possibility of the species restoring itself using n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ ing stocks .
The stock of the Sousa Chin@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ is species , from which the newly discovered population d@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ v@@ es , has automatically grown weaker , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new marine mam@@ mal species ?
Marine mamm@@ als are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in h@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ e@@ ous , open habit@@ ats , in which there are numerous genetic exchanges between populations and individuals .
This b@@ l@@ ending of genes limits the creation of new species .
On the other hand , more e@@ n@@ c@@ losed eco@@ systems favour genetic isolation , which can ultimately lead to the creation of new species .
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least known of environments .
We prefer sending robots to Mars rather than knowing what is living in the Mari@@ ana T@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ ch , just 11 kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ es below the surface of the ocean .
More money is spent on the search for life on other plan@@ ets than on marine research , and it is high time things changed .
RBS suspends two forex traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation , in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction .
Some of the world 's largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and RBS , have confirmed they are co-@@ operating with regulators in investigations into the world 's largest financial market , where $ 5.@@ 3@@ t@@ n changes hands each day .
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the wid@@ ening probe that echo@@ es the L@@ i@@ b@@ or i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ bank lending manipulation scandal .
The bank , which declined to comment on the s@@ u@@ s@@ p@@ e@@ n@@ sions , confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators .
" Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-@@ operating fully with the FC@@ A and our other regulators , " the bank said two weeks ago .
Last month , people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of e@@ m@@ ails and instant messages to the UK regul@@ ator , the Financial C@@ o@@ n@@ duct Authority , sent to and from a former trad@@ er .
This trad@@ er , Richard U@@ s@@ h@@ er , left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JP@@ Morgan .
R@@ o@@ han Ram@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ ani , head of European spot trading at Citi , went on leave this week , while Matt G@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ i@@ n@@ er , a former senior currencies trad@@ er at Barclays and UBS , was suspended by Standard Chartered this week .
None of these traders have been accused of any wrong@@ doing .
Mr U@@ s@@ h@@ er 's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup , people close to the situation said .
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regul@@ ator , F@@ i@@ n@@ ma , said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks .
At least six authorities glob@@ ally - the European Commission , F@@ i@@ n@@ ma , Swit@@ zer@@ land 's competition authority W@@ e@@ ko , the FC@@ A , the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers c@@ o@@ l@@ l@@ uded to move the currencies market .
HSBC , Citigroup , JP@@ Morgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators , said people familiar with the situation .
Banks are scouring through years " worth of instant messages and e@@ m@@ ails to search for instances of wrong@@ doing .
News about the probes has r@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ led traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks ' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipul@@ ate , but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true .
A senior trad@@ er said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading , the f@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ation of liqui@@ dity between different trading platforms and banks " increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that " you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices . "
The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trad@@ er at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $ 6@@ m loss late last year .
The bank p@@ r@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ tly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-@@ operating with its regulators .
" We are confident the trad@@ er acted alone and that the matter has been contained , " Credit Suisse said .
Investig@@ ation on Mayor Rob Ford Bot@@ ched , Law@@ yer Main@@ t@@ ains
After the police confirmed that they laid hands on a copy of a video allegedly showing Rob Ford smoking crack , B@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ ter Clayton Ru@@ by maintained that he has never seen an investigation " so bot@@ ched . "
The barrister said to the Canadian Press that he believes the police had " ignored or down@@ played " evidence against the mayor .
This Thursday , police arrested Rob Ford 's friend and o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ s@@ i@@ onal c@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ eur , Alexander Lis@@ i , aged 35 , and charged him with extortion in r@@ e@@ l@@ ation with the video .
Lis@@ i , who has previously been accused of drug traff@@ icking , was frequently in contact with the mayor .
The police said they have also observed him delivering p@@ a@@ r@@ c@@ els to Rob Ford , according to new court documents .
Ru@@ by says it is " i@@ n@@ explic@@ able " that the police have never searched Rob Ford 's vehicle or home , or tapped his telephone , saying that chief of police Bill Blair knowingly decided not to act against the mayor .
In accord@@ ance with the law , the police , having themselves witnessed suspicious transactions , could have intercep@@ ted Ford 's vehicle , arrested the mayor and carried out a search - even without a warrant .
They could also have requested an immediate search warrant , if this was considered necessary .
The chief of police has not commented . However , his spokesman , Mark P@@ u@@ gash , has described Ru@@ by 's statements as " an obvious and desperate attempt " to sell himself to the media in a matter that does not concern him at all .
In a press conference on Thursday , Mr Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that might constitu@@ te a " reasonable motive " that could lead to criminal charges being brought against the mayor .
European Markets , Except London , Fall in Mid@@ -@@ session
The major European stock markets , except London , are on a down trend in mid-@@ session this Friday . They are being dragged down by disappointing news from businesses , while Wall Street is expected to experience a rise .
Also , investors are still t@@ r@@ e@@ ading with caution , as they believe that the American Federal Reserve might end its quanti@@ t@@ ative easing policy earlier than expected .
On the other hand , following the announcement of a 0.7 % inflation throughout the eurozone , the idea that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) might rela@@ x its monetary policy has been spreading among@@ st actors in the market .
Futures on Wall Street are suggesting that opening price of US shares will rise , following two consecutive sessions marked by a down@@ ward trend .
On the securities market , Renault ( -@@ 4.@@ 63 % ) recorded the greatest drop with the CA@@ C 40 , weighed down by the profit warning issued by its partner , Nissan Motor , on Friday .
The Royal Bank of Scotland ( -@@ 6.@@ 26 % ) recorded the worst performance in the Euro@@ F@@ i@@ r@@ s@@ t@@ 300 , after also reporting a decline in earnings this morning and announcing the creation of an internal bad bank structure covering £ 38 000 million of its highest risk assets .
On its part , Vodafone ( + 2@@ .@@ 45 % ) is still leading the upward trend in the Euro@@ F@@ i@@ r@@ s@@ t@@ 300 in response to a press release indicating that AT & T was looking at a possible takeover bid .
On the exchange market , speculation regarding a change in the ECB 's monetary policy are r@@ i@@ fe , as testified by John Hardy , a strategist at Sa@@ x@@ o Bank .
The ECB 's sole mand@@ ate has always revol@@ ved around inflation , therefore Mario Dr@@ a@@ g@@ hi and his team have all the more reason to take action at their meeting next week .
We are forec@@ a@@ s@@ ting a highly likely drop in the Euro .
In this context , the Euro continues to drop as compared to the US dollar and , during the session , reached a record two-@@ week low at $ 1@@ .@@ 35@@ 17 .
Convers@@ ely , these very specul@@ ations are boosting the bond market in the eurozone .
Supreme Court uph@@ olds Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama administration , the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama 's signature health care law is constitutional .
By a 5-@@ 4 vote , the justices ruled the P@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ ent Protection and Aff@@ ordable Care Act 's individual mand@@ ate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the tax@@ ing power of the government .
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while J@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ ces Sc@@ alia , Thomas , Ali@@ to and Kennedy d@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ed .
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2@@ 700 page law , and further held that the health care law 's requirement that states increase Medicaid eli@@ gibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding is not u@@ n@@ constitutionally c@@ o@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ i@@ ve .
The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
The law was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season , including presum@@ p@@ tive nominee Mitt Romney .

In the heart of the T@@ r@@ a@@ b@@ u@@ quet c@@ e@@ m@@ etery , civilian , religious and military officials , plus numerous pa@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ o@@ tic organisations , paid tribute to all soldiers and victims of every war on Friday afternoon .
F@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ers were laid on two of the three military burial plots in the c@@ e@@ m@@ etery by Mayor Jean-Claude G@@ u@@ i@@ bal and various other person@@ alities .
Palestinians and Israeli@@ s C@@ l@@ ash on Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on the evening of 31 October 2@@ 0@@ 13 during a violent clash on the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip stopped working on Friday 1 November , following exhau@@ s@@ tion of its fuel reserve , the Energy Authority for the Palestinian e@@ n@@ c@@ l@@ ave announced .
A local commander of the E@@ z@@ z@@ e@@ d@@ ine al-Q@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ am Brig@@ ades , Khal@@ ed A@@ b@@ ou B@@ a@@ k@@ r , and another officer of the armed wing of Hamas , Rab@@ i@@ e@@ h B@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ h , were killed by a tank shell during an incursion by the Israeli army east of Khan Youn@@ es , in the south of the Gaza Strip , according to local medical sources .
Two other local officers of the Al-@@ Q@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ am Brig@@ ades , Mohammed al-Q@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ as and Mohammed Da@@ oud , were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian e@@ n@@ c@@ l@@ ave and Israel .
Attack on tunnel d@@ u@@ g by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli tank and an armoured bull@@ d@@ o@@ zer made an incursion a hundred metres or so into the territory before retre@@ ating .
The confrontation lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a statement , a Hamas spokesperson , Sam@@ i A@@ b@@ ou Z@@ o@@ u@@ hri , paid tribute to the four " heroes " and stated that Israeli soldiers had died in the confrontation .
Hamas praised the " Al-@@ Q@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ am heroes who died defending the territory against an incursion at Khan Youn@@ es by the Zi@@ onist occu@@ pier .
Many enemies were killed or injured during the operation .
Hamas guarantees that Gaza will be hell for the occu@@ pier , " the spokesperson threatened .
The Israeli army , on the other hand , stated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel d@@ u@@ g into Israeli territory from the Palestinian e@@ n@@ c@@ l@@ ave , which was discovered on 7 October and , according to the army , was intended for " terrorist activities . "
Hamas has defended its use of tun@@ n@@ els in the fight against Israel , stating that the aim was to capture Israeli soldiers so they could be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners .
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military statement .
During the operation , Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the " T@@ s@@ a@@ h@@ al forces " ( the Israeli army ) and injured five soldiers .
Israeli attack in northern Syria
" This mission was essential because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians , " said army spokesperson , Peter L@@ e@@ r@@ ner .
Fur@@ thermore , Israel attacked a military airbase in the northwest of Syria , targeting a shipment of missiles d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah , satellite channel Al-@@ Arab@@ i@@ ya reported on Thursday 31 October .
A US official confirmed that there had been an " Israeli strike , " but did not give details of the target .
" In the past , the targets have been missiles being transferred to Hezbollah , " he merely added .
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information relating to the attack .
Citing " exclusive sources " that it did not name , the S@@ audi@@ -@@ owned channel stated that " the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-@@ to-@@ air missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon , " referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that is fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces .
Earlier , a Syrian NGO , the Syrian Ob@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ atory for Human Rights , reported several explosions being heard at dawn on Wednesday in a defence airbase at Son@@ ar J@@ able , near L@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ a@@ q@@ u@@ ie , on the Syrian coast .
This organisation , which relies on a network of militants and medical sources , was unable to identify the origin of the explosions .
It 's a comeback in black and white for Marie C@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ i@@ n@@ ard , who is staging " A Dan@@ se Dan@@ se , " her two new group c@@ h@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ es : the first inspired by the ink dra@@ wings and p@@ o@@ e@@ m@@ s of Hen@@ ri M@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ aux , the second inspired by the famous piano s@@ o@@ l@@ os of G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ o@@ p@@ é@@ dies de S@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ e .
This is an evening that showcases C@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ i@@ n@@ ard 's entire spectrum , from art to m@@ a@@ n@@ ner@@ isms and from the black@@ ness of ink to w@@ h@@ i@@ t@@ eness .
The background is a white screen .
On the carpet , which is also white , in the immense space of the T@@ h@@ é@@ â@@ t@@ r@@ e M@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ o@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ u@@ ve , a body appears , in profile , as thin as a line and dressed in black .
An Hen@@ ri M@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ aux ink drawing is projected onto the screen .
The body , a simple stroke , takes its shape .
And this shape is defin@@ itive of the entire piece : it is a series of physical repres@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ations of dra@@ wings .
The d@@ ancers , all dressed in black , with only their hands and faces uncovered , wait on each side of the stage ; they hur@@ ry on when the next graphic appears , i@@ n@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ n@@ ate it , then run off again .
This Hen@@ ri M@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ aux play with black and white is performed as a series of s@@ o@@ l@@ os , in a group in u@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ on ( a mass acting as a solo ) , a large group of t@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ ve s@@ o@@ l@@ os , in which each individual makes a representation of their own sign .
It is reminis@@ cent of " G@@ l@@ o@@ ire du m@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ n , " w@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ e@@ in , in the form of s@@ o@@ l@@ os , C@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ i@@ n@@ ard delivers a series of c@@ h@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ c tasks drawn on c@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ els and lined up at the front of the stage .
It is the same principle in a giant Power@@ Point version .
In this performance , the music is loud , accompanied by p@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sion and electric guit@@ ars .
The energy is great , and the rhythm fast .
There is a break when Carol P@@ r@@ i@@ eur takes refuge under the dance m@@ at , micro@@ phone in hand , to deliver , with no s@@ o@@ b@@ r@@ i@@ ety or reserve , part of a M@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ aux poem , in the flat m@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ t@@ onous voice of an auction , then continues to dance .
The music starts again , and the sequence continues .
This sustained ( if that is possible ) d@@ i@@ s@@ charge of sound and energy ends up being d@@ e@@ a@@ f@@ ening and n@@ u@@ m@@ bing ,
as does the regul@@ a@@ r@@ ity of the visual rhythm .
There are several beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been one of C@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ i@@ n@@ ard 's strong points - like the hair that is r@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ led or the black fab@@ ric that extends the lines .
But the c@@ h@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ c approach l@@ acks composition .
One gets the impression that , instead of going in search of M@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ aux 's work , the c@@ h@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ her has imposed herself on it with using her m@@ a@@ n@@ ner@@ isms .
The result is bodies that seem flat in front of the dra@@ wings .
The M@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ aux inks , like G@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ alt shapes , provide a level of imagination broader and richer than dance , more p@@ o@@ r@@ ous .
Only at the end , which is in negative , with the d@@ ancers broken up a stro@@ be lights and becoming white sym@@ b@@ ols in a suddenly dark theatre , does it touch on magic .
The audience liked it , the reception was warm .
After the i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ val , the G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ o@@ p@@ é@@ dies is richer .
The stage is partly draped in grey , the d@@ ancers and a piano are covered in fab@@ ric , like furniture in an abandoned house .
At the piano , d@@ ancers take turns to play the scores .
Their touching musical awk@@ ward@@ ness shows real f@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ty .
Cou@@ ples cross the stage as pairs of lovers , very s@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ u@@ al , even ero@@ tic .
Group work , small t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ iting s@@ o@@ l@@ os , moving as a group , a chorus , makes the depic@@ tion less b@@ i@@ n@@ ary .
C@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ns appear , another regular feature of C@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ i@@ n@@ ard 's work , wearing red n@@ o@@ ses , in very p@@ o@@ l@@ a@@ r@@ ised p@@ a@@ r@@ ades of male / female lovers .
Their loves are t@@ o@@ othy , evasive or playful .
The body movements , the laugh@@ ter , the small cries b@@ e@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ fully t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ late the arch@@ a@@ i@@ c@@ ness , the g@@ r@@ ace@@ f@@ u@@ l@@ ness and the a@@ b@@ s@@ u@@ r@@ dity of bodies in c@@ o@@ i@@ t@@ us , of beings melting into each other .
But the piece really takes off after the b@@ o@@ w .
A c@@ l@@ o@@ wn comes back on stage as the audience is leaving .
At that point , anything goes : the fourth wall comes down , the explored u@@ n@@ i@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ses are super@@ imposed , the d@@ ancers ham it up , come down among the spectators , talk , smoke , pass through , play with the e@@ t@@ i@@ q@@ u@@ ette of applause , build up the hy@@ pe amid a c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ ously calculated disorder that remains s@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ u@@ al .
They exu@@ de joy and mad@@ ness , and that is C@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ i@@ n@@ ard 's art ; c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ ating the audience .
Google , Samsung , Hua@@ w@@ e@@ i sued over N@@ o@@ r@@ tel patents
The group that owns thousands of former N@@ o@@ r@@ tel patents filed a barr@@ age of pat@@ ent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google , the company it o@@ u@@ t@@ bid in the N@@ o@@ r@@ tel bankruptcy auction .
Rock@@ star , the consortium that bought the N@@ o@@ r@@ tel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Elec@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ics Co Ltd , H@@ T@@ C Corp , Hua@@ w@@ e@@ i and four other companies for pat@@ ent infr@@ ingement in U.S. District Court in Texas .
Rock@@ star is joint@@ ly owned by Apple , Microsoft , Blackberry , Ericsson and Sony .
Google is accused of infr@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ing seven patents .
The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising , the lawsuit said , which is the core of Google 's search business .
Representatives for Samsung , Hua@@ w@@ e@@ i , H@@ T@@ C and Rock@@ star could not immediately be reached .
Samsung , Hua@@ w@@ e@@ i and H@@ T@@ C all manufac@@ ture phones that operate on Google 's A@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ o@@ id operating system , which compe@@ tes fier@@ cely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products .
In 2011 Google placed an initial $ 900 million bid for N@@ o@@ r@@ tel 's patents .
Google increased its bid several times , ultimately offering as much as $ 4.@@ 4 billion .
After losing out to Rock@@ star on the N@@ o@@ r@@ tel patents , Google went on to acqu@@ ire Mot@@ o@@ r@@ ola Mobility for $ 12.@@ 5 billion , a deal driven partly by Mot@@ o@@ r@@ ola 's libr@@ ary of patents .
" Despite losing in its attempt to acqu@@ ire the pat@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ s@@ -@@ in-@@ suit at auction , Google has infr@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ed and continues to infr@@ inge , " the lawsuit said .
Rock@@ star is seeking increased damages against Google , as it claims Google 's pat@@ ent infr@@ ingement is w@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ful , according to the complaint .
G@@ e@@ s@@ ves : Faul@@ ty Water H@@ e@@ ater Cau@@ ses E@@ x@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ sion of House
The g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mother apparently lit a cigarette while there was a gas l@@ e@@ ak ,
leading to an explosion in a house in G@@ e@@ s@@ ves that left two people seriously injured on Friday morning - the 52-year-old g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mother and her 5-@@ year-old grandson . The explosion was caused by a gas l@@ e@@ ak in a f@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ ty water heater , the assistant public prosecutor said on Friday evening .
The expert , who was d@@ i@@ s@@ pat@@ ched to the scene by the public prosecutor 's office , stated that the cause of the explosion was purely accidental .
The g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mother lit a cigarette when there was a gas l@@ e@@ ak and a b@@ u@@ i@@ l@@ d-up of gas .
The condition of the two victims remains critical .
The g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mother was thrown across the room by the explosion and seriously burnt .
The little boy , who was staying with his grandfather and partner , was by her side and suffered less serious burns .
" The two victims were intu@@ b@@ ated and treated for some time at the site , before being taken to the CH@@ U in L@@ i@@ è@@ ge , by helicopter and by ambulance for the g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mother and her grandson respectively , " said Mayor José P@@ a@@ u@@ let on visiting the site .
The t@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ sed grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion .
He was u@@ n@@ hurt and , thus , able to go down@@ stairs using the stair@@ case which had remained intact , though the r@@ e@@ ar wall of the house was completely destroyed .
The grandfather and the tenant of the house next door , which was weak@@ ened by the explosion , have been accommod@@ ated elsewhere by the head of the social services .
The A@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ ne and Nam@@ ur fire departments and the police from A@@ r@@ ches interven@@ ed .

Egypt swe@@ ars in first freely elected president
Mohamed Mor@@ si takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political stri@@ fe in Egypt .
IS@@ L@@ AM@@ IST Mohamed Mor@@ si promised a " new Egypt " as he took the oath of office to become the country 's first freely elected president , s@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ eding Hos@@ ni M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak who was ousted 16 months ago .
At his inauguration before the Supreme C@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ tional Court , Mor@@ si also became the Arab world 's first freely elected Islam@@ ist president and Egypt 's fifth head of state since the o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ throw of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
He took the oath before the court 's 18 black@@ -@@ r@@ o@@ bed judges in its Nil@@ e@@ -@@ side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian t@@ e@@ m@@ ple .
" We a@@ s@@ pire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second republic , " Mor@@ si said during a solem@@ n ceremony shown live on state television .
" Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , " said Mor@@ si , a 60-@@ year-old US-@@ trained engineer from the Muslim B@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ hood , a fundam@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ alist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments .
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11@@ am local time in a small motor@@ c@@ ade .
Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to c@@ h@@ e@@ er the new president and , in a departure from the presidential p@@ o@@ m@@ p of the M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak years , traffic was only briefly h@@ a@@ l@@ ted to allow his motor@@ c@@ ade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs .
Der@@ i@@ d@@ ed as the B@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ hood 's u@@ n@@ charis@@ matic " spare ty@@ re , " his personal prestige has surg@@ ed since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islam@@ ists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the author@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ an M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak .
" Egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , " Mor@@ si , wearing a blue business suit and a red tie , told the judges in the w@@ o@@ o@@ d@@ -@@ pan@@ elled chamber where he took the oath of office .
Mor@@ si later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address .
He was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national a@@ n@@ them as he stood to attention .
Military rul@@ er Field Marshal Hussein T@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ awi was in attendance .
His arrival was greeted with chants of , " The army and the people are one hand , " from the hundreds gathered in the university 's main lecture room .
Est@@ abli@@ shed in 1@@ 9@@ 08 as a b@@ a@@ s@@ tion of secul@@ ar education , Cairo University later became a s@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ h@@ old of Islam@@ ist student groups in the 1970s .
Mor@@ si took a symbolic oath on Friday in T@@ a@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ r Square , birth@@ place of the uprising that ended M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak 's author@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ an rule last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers stri@@ pped from his office by the military council that took over from the ousted leader .
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , he is b@@ o@@ wing to the military 's will in an indication that the contest for power will continue .
Mor@@ si 's speech in T@@ a@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ r Square was filled with dramatic populist gest@@ ures .
The shutdown in the USA has slow@@ ed down the automotive market .
According to figures published on Friday by manufacturers , five of the top six of which have recorded results below expectations , the 16-@@ day shutdown of most federal administration services s@@ u@@ p@@ pressed growth in car sales in the USA in October .
The three major manufacturers in Detroit r@@ e@@ alised double-digit growth as compared to October 2012 , but only General Motors performed better than expected .
Analysts had forecast average sales of 15.@@ 4 million units ( annu@@ alised rate , adjusted with seas@@ onal vari@@ ations ) , but the market settled at 15.@@ 3 million , according to estimates by Adam Jon@@ as , an analyst at Morgan Stanley .
In a note to the bank 's clients , he states that this slight slow-@@ down can p@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ally be explained by " the government shutdown and its impact on consumers ' feelings in the first half of the month . "
Nevertheless , GM has reported an increase of about 16 % in sales last month with 22@@ 6,4@@ 02 vehicles , as compared to 2@@ 11,5@@ 63 expected by consensus .
The four brands of the group saw an improvement in their commercial performance over October 2012 .
Ford , which is still r@@ e@@ aping benefits from the success of its p@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ -up trucks among@@ st other things , saw sales increase by 14 % over a year to 1@@ 9@@ 1,9@@ 85 vehicles , against an expectation of 1@@ 9@@ 4,3@@ 01 .
On its part , Chrysler , which is controlled by Fiat , announced an 11 % increase in sales with 140,@@ 0@@ 83 vehicles , against an expected 1@@ 4@@ 3,5@@ 36 .
Toyota and Nissan also reported sales below expectations , despite increases of 8.@@ 8 % and 14.@@ 2 % respectively over a year .
On the New York Stock Exchange , GM shares gained 1.4 % at 16 : 35 GMT , while Ford lost 1.1 % .
Renault Share Price P@@ l@@ u@@ m@@ mets Following Nissan War@@ ning
Renault recorded the biggest drop on the SB@@ F 120 index in Paris on Friday after its partner , Nissan Motors , announced that it had reduced its net annual profit forecast by almost 20 % , traders report .
Nissan , which was forced to make the r@@ e@@ vision , also announced a management restructuring .
Several traders reported that Renault shares had been affected by the warning this morning .
" It 's clearly because of the Nissan profit warning , " said a trading representative from a Paris broker .
Under the Ren@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ -@@ Nissan alliance , Renault holds 4@@ 3.4 % of Nissan 's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15 % of the French company 's , according to data on the Nissan website .
Gre@@ ece : Two Dead in Shoo@@ ting Near N@@ e@@ o@@ -@@ Nazi Party Office
Two people were killed and another seriously injured on Friday evening by gun@@ shots fired by two people on a motor@@ bike that was passing an office used by neo-@@ Nazi party , Golden Dawn , in the western suburbs of Athens , a police source has said .
The police are currently unable to give any information on the identity of the victims or any political affili@@ ations they had .
According to reports from some Greek media , members of Golden Dawn said the victims were guar@@ ding the party 's premises .
The injured person was immediately taken to hospital , the same source said .
Anti-@@ terrorist service police rushed to the main avenue in the subur@@ b of N@@ e@@ o Ir@@ a@@ k@@ lio , where the incident took place , and sealed off the area .
The incident comes a few weeks after six Golden Dawn members , including the leader and founder of the party , were charged with being part of a " criminal organisation , " within the framework of an operation aimed at the party following the murder of an anti-@@ fas@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ t musician by one of its members .
Scott Brown Ap@@ p@@ e@@ al R@@ e@@ j@@ e@@ cted
Scott Brown , Glasgow Celtic captain , has had his appeal rejected and will miss his club 's next two Champi@@ on 's League matches , against Aj@@ a@@ x and AC Milan .
The Scotland midfielder was sent off for a foul against N@@ e@@ y@@ mar in the match against FC Barcelona . U@@ EFA has now extended his suspension to three matches .
In a press release , the club said it was " very disappointed " and that the appeal was entirely justified .
Close to 50,000 homes throughout the province were left without power shortly after midday on Friday , due to violent winds hitting numerous regions along the St Lawrence River .
The sectors worst affected are the L@@ a@@ u@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ des , Mont@@ é@@ r@@ é@@ g@@ i@@ e , and Out@@ a@@ o@@ u@@ ais , with 15,0@@ 42 , 13,@@ 4@@ 64 and 8@@ ,@@ 6@@ 42 customers respectively plun@@ ged into darkness .
The m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ politan region of Montreal is also experiencing its share of break@@ downs , with close to 7,000 homes in the city and in L@@ a@@ v@@ al left without power .
Thou@@ ght travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
Flight Centre seem to be bucking the trend .
The company has u@@ p@@ grad@@ ed its full year profit forecast and is looking to record earnings from h@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ day@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel company now expects its full year u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ lying profit before tax to be between $ 3@@ 25 million and $ 340 million , compared with the $ 3@@ 05 million to $ 315 million it previously forecast .
If the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $ 29@@ 0.4 million profit it achieved in 2011 / 12 .
Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in Australian and UK non-@@ business travel .
" Year@@ -to-@@ date , our 10 countries are profitable and several are on track for record full-year earnings before interest and tax contributions , " he said .
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically our largest profit generators .
In Australia the leisure business rebounded during the second half which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market .
Similarly in the UK , Flight Centre 's leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less .
Its US business had recovered its losses during its seas@@ onally weaker first half and was expected to deliver its third consecutive full year profit .
Flight Centre shares were up 3@@ c at $ 38.@@ 20 yesterday .
U@@ n@@ known P@@ e@@ r@@ sons Open Fire on Hotel Near P@@ y@@ ram@@ ids in Cairo
U@@ n@@ known persons wearing hoods opened fire on a hotel close to the p@@ y@@ ram@@ ids in Cairo , Egypt this Friday . Nobody was hurt in the incident which apparently resulted from an argument involving workers who had been made red@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ ant .
The attack@@ ers fled , according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior , Police General A@@ b@@ del L@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ f .
The attack took place at a time when Egypt is hardly receiving any tourists since the army deposed the Islamic President , Mohamed Mor@@ si , in early July and blood@@ ily s@@ u@@ p@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ ses demonstrations by his supporters .
Schools urged to focus more on m@@ a@@ ths , spelling and g@@ r@@ a@@ m@@ mar
English literature courses will require pup@@ ils to study at least one Shakespeare play , a 19th century novel , Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 o@@ n@@ wards .
The exam will also feature " u@@ n@@ seen tex@@ ts " to encourage wider reading ;
A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped .
From 2@@ 0@@ 15 , pup@@ ils will be required to take a standalone G@@ CS@@ E in language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification .
The Department for Education is due to release the new s@@ y@@ l@@ lab@@ uses in English and m@@ a@@ ths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul .
It will make changes in other core subjects next year .
In a separate move , Of@@ q@@ u@@ al , the e@@ x@@ ams regul@@ ator , will unve@@ il a shak@@ e-up of the structure of G@@ C@@ SE@@ s , with a new grading system and less c@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ e@@ work .
Speaking in the summer , Michael G@@ o@@ ve , the Education Secretary , said there was a " widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , " insist@@ ing G@@ C@@ SE@@ s would be " more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . "
Stu@@ dies show that English schools d@@ e@@ vote less time to m@@ a@@ ths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries .
By comparison , Australian schools provide an average of 1@@ 4@@ 3 hours a year and pup@@ ils do around 138 hours in Singapore .
While there will be no formal requirement to d@@ e@@ vote more of the timet@@ able to m@@ a@@ ths , Coalition sources said the extensive m@@ a@@ ths G@@ CS@@ E - combined with more weigh@@ ting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching .
The s@@ y@@ l@@ lab@@ us will place a greater focus on " real world problems , " including financial mathem@@ atics .
This judgement means that it will be possible to enforce a law which was adopted in this state in July and widely brings the issue of the right to abortion into question .

Former G@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ apo Chief Bur@@ i@@ ed in Jewish Cem@@ etery
Hein@@ rich M@@ u@@ l@@ ler , who was never found after d@@ i@@ s@@ appearing at the end of the Second World War , was actually buried in a common grave in a Jewish c@@ e@@ m@@ etery in Berlin , the head of the German R@@ e@@ s@@ istance Memorial , Professor Johann@@ es T@@ u@@ chel , confirmed to Bil@@ d .
M@@ u@@ l@@ ler did not survive the war .
" His body was buried in a common grave in the Jewish c@@ e@@ m@@ etery in Berlin Mit@@ te in 1@@ 9@@ 45 , " he confirmed in the popular daily newspaper , basing his statement on archives .
This rev@@ e@@ l@@ ation comes 68 years after the fall of A@@ d@@ olf Hit@@ ler 's Nazi regime and s@@ o@@ l@@ ves one of the big post-@@ War my@@ ster@@ ies .
The German Secret Service , the B@@ ND , declared in summer 1@@ 9@@ 49 that M@@ u@@ l@@ ler was in Kar@@ l@@ o@@ v@@ y V@@ ary , then in C@@ ze@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ slo@@ v@@ a@@ k@@ ia , according to a document obtained by Bil@@ d .
But the secret services were completely wrong .
" M@@ u@@ l@@ ler 's body was found in August 1@@ 9@@ 45 by a commando in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of Aviation of the Reich , " says Mr. T@@ u@@ chel .
He was wearing " a general 's uniform . "
" His service papers and photo , among@@ st other things , were found in the inside left pocket , " he continued .
Bil@@ d also published a document from the borough hall of the Mit@@ te district in Berlin , indicating that he had been buried in the district 's Jewish c@@ e@@ m@@ etery .
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany , D@@ i@@ eter G@@ r@@ a@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ n , said he was shocked by the rev@@ e@@ l@@ ation .
F@@ i@@ n@@ ding that one of the most brutal Nazi sad@@ ists was buried in a Jewish c@@ e@@ m@@ etery is an abhor@@ rent enorm@@ ity , he said .
" The memory of the victims is being t@@ r@@ a@@ m@@ pled u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ foot in the worst manner , " he said disgu@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ d@@ ly in the paper .
Hein@@ rich M@@ u@@ l@@ ler was one of the major figures in the Third Reich never to be captured .
He took part in the Wann@@ see Conference in January 1942 , where the " final solution " was decided upon , and notably was in command of A@@ d@@ olf E@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ n , who was responsible for the " logis@@ tics " of the e@@ x@@ termination of the Jews and who was sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962 .

Tre@@ k@@ king through mud , rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges B@@ w@@ elle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cam@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ on
B@@ w@@ elle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There aren 't many doctors in the west African country ; just one for every 5,000 people
Cast your vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges B@@ w@@ elle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2@@ 0@@ 13 .
You can vote for him , or any of the other top 10 Heroes , to be CNN Her@@ o of the Year .
That person will receive $ 25@@ 0,000 to continue their extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Georges B@@ w@@ elle watched his ill father slip in and out of c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ o@@ u@@ s@@ ness , traveling to hospitals that weren 't equipped to help him .
Jam@@ ef B@@ w@@ elle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Y@@ a@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ de , Cam@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ on 's capital .
He suffered only a broken arm at first , but an infection developed and spread to his brain , creating a hem@@ a@@ t@@ oma that would affect him for the rest of his life .
" There were no neur@@ o@@ surgeons in Cam@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ on , " Georges B@@ w@@ elle said .
We would have taken him out of Cam@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ on if we had the money .
Instead , B@@ w@@ elle spent years escor@@ ting his father to overcrowded clin@@ ics and hospitals , getting whatever treatment they could get .
" It 's not easy , " B@@ w@@ elle said .
You can leave home at 5 a.m. , running to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are a lot of patients .
Some people can die because they are waiting .
The situation hasn 't changed much since B@@ w@@ elle 's father passed away in 2002 .
In Cam@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .
For comparison 's sake , the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people .
And even if they could see a physician , many Cam@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ oni@@ ans couldn 't afford it .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of the country 's health-@@ care spending is private .
" The only problem they have is poverty , " B@@ w@@ elle said .
And with poverty , they cannot enjoy their life .
S@@ e@@ e@@ ing his father and so many of his country@@ men suffer , B@@ w@@ elle was determined to do something about it .
Dr. Georges B@@ w@@ elle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surg@@ eries in the past year .
He became a doctor himself , working as a vascul@@ ar surgeon in Y@@ a@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ de 's Central Hospital .
And he started a nonprofit , A@@ S@@ CO@@ VI@@ ME , that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 3@@ 2,000 people .
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people j@@ am into v@@ ans , tie medical supplies to the roof@@ s and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need .
Their luck doesn 't always hold out .
They 've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .
But when they arrive , they receive a true heroes ' welcome : a feast , singing and dancing , and the best accommod@@ ations the community can offer .
In these villages , free medical care is truly a cause for celebration , and B@@ w@@ elle -- with his big smile and boun@@ dless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun .
The next morning , the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients .
" We are receiving 500 people in each trip , " B@@ w@@ elle said .
They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village , and they 're coming on foot .
Each of these weekend clin@@ ics provides a variety of medical care .
Many people are treated for malaria , tuber@@ culo@@ sis , m@@ a@@ l@@ nutrition , diabetes , paras@@ ites and sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases .
Others might receive cru@@ tches , a pair of d@@ o@@ n@@ ated eye@@ glasses or free birth certi@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ates -- documentation that 's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can 't afford .
In the e@@ v@@ enings , the team will do simple surg@@ eries with local a@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ thes@@ ia .
Oper@@ ations are usually done in a school@@ house , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person .
With the group 's generator lighting the operating room and s@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ z@@ ing equipment , B@@ w@@ elle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning .
It 's a back@@ breaking pace , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .
" They are beating d@@ r@@ ums all night to keep us awake and continue our work , " B@@ w@@ elle said .
On Sunday , the team heads back to the city , tired but proud of their work .
The group -- a mix of Cam@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ o@@ n@@ ian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surg@@ eries in the past year , and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help .
One man explained that the free her@@ nia surgery he 'd received will allow him to work again .
" This will change my future with my family , " the man said .
In addition to holding these weekend clin@@ ics and working as a hospital surgeon , B@@ w@@ elle also works nights at private medical clin@@ ics around Y@@ a@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ de .
It 's this second job , he said , that funds about 60 % of his nonprofit ; the rest is covered by private donations .
" I 'm not sure when he sleep@@ s , " said Katie O 'Malley , a second-@@ year medical student from Dre@@ x@@ el University in Philadelphia and volunteer with B@@ w@@ elle 's group .
He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns .
For medical and nursing students such as O 'Malley , who come from the United States and Europe to join B@@ w@@ elle on his missions , it 's a hands-on opportunity they 'd never get at home .
" We 've been able to scru@@ b in on surg@@ eries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. B@@ w@@ elle , " O 'Malley said .
That 's not something you 'd ever get to do in America as a second-@@ year medical student .
The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cam@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ on , often arriving with d@@ o@@ n@@ ated medical supplies .
But once they arrive in Y@@ a@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ de , their board , transportation and instruction are covered by B@@ w@@ elle .
" He 's a hero , without a doubt , " O 'Malley said .

Pierre N@@ o@@ r@@ a 's Two Frances
P@@ e@@ r@@ p@@ l@@ e@@ x@@ ed by his work , academics have long struggled to define and place Pierre N@@ o@@ r@@ a .
Is he a professor in lecture halls and class@@ rooms ?
Of course , but with emphasis on his fond@@ ness for by@@ roads , at S@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ es-@@ Po ( French Institute of Political Sciences ) , and Hau@@ tes E@@ t@@ u@@ des ( School for Advanced Stu@@ dies in the Social Sciences ) .
Does he play an a@@ r@@ b@@ i@@ t@@ er of the work of others from his office in Rue G@@ ast@@ o@@ n@@ -@@ Galli@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ d ?
Yes , but while ignoring his less@@ er known work and underground writing as an editor .
Is he the heir to F@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ elle 's chair at the A@@ c@@ a@@ d@@ é@@ mie F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ç@@ aise ?
Yes again , but he knows that such an honour cannot replace the real holy oil , the phil@@ os@@ oph@@ ical work , which he has f@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ g@@ one .
They have g@@ l@@ a@@ d@@ ly acknowledged him as a great a@@ w@@ a@@ k@@ ener , a driving force , a u@@ n@@ i@@ fier of their work , but observed that he seemed d@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ l@@ ined to produce such work himself .
The monum@@ ental " L@@ i@@ e@@ u@@ x de m@@ é@@ m@@ o@@ ire " ( places of memory ) , to which his name is attached , has also contributed to this unclear image .
Sc@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ mongers have regarded this work as a gig@@ antic " fle@@ a market , " presented by an intelligent and very learned comment@@ ator with a keen eye , but who is an incur@@ able " d@@ a@@ b@@ b@@ l@@ er . "
The two works published by N@@ o@@ r@@ a almost two years ago have already proven that though he appeared not to write , he had written - p@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ fully and well .
This book should defin@@ iti@@ v@@ ely do him justice .
However , once again , there is a tendency towards ubi@@ quity , intellectual r@@ o@@ aming , jubil@@ ation in jumping , as if with both feet tied , from one subject to another .
Nevertheless , one quickly understands that the dispar@@ ate objects gathered together in this b@@ e@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ fully titled book lead the " second-@@ hand goods dealer " to a constant passion , that of discovering the core that makes up the French identity .
Why these dramatic appeals for national unity ?
I@@ denti@@ ty is a contemporary p@@ r@@ e@@ occupation .
Not long ago , we were asked to collec@@ tively define it .
But , in the p@@ e@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ p@@ tory minds of our former leaders , French identity was a tim@@ eless essence .
All it took was to highlight its mistakes and , in keeping with Jac@@ o@@ b@@ i@@ n@@ ism , the issue would be e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ sted to p@@ r@@ e@@ f@@ ects and sub-@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ f@@ ects - the author@@ ised interpre@@ ters .
What Pierre N@@ o@@ r@@ a is searching for is something else .
He does not position himself as an heir to an eternal Fren@@ c@@ h@@ ness ; he rejects the definition .
As an analyst a@@ n@@ x@@ i@@ ous about a familiar strang@@ eness , he w@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ ers in a forest of sym@@ b@@ ols , stops after each step to examine an object in the form of a puzz@@ le , tor@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ed by irritating questions ,
such as this , which arises from the undertaking itself : why , in a country so perman@@ ently established within its fron@@ t@@ i@@ ers , with such an ancient structure and that is so soli@@ dly built , do we hear these dramatic calls for unity ?
The calls are pressing only because of the need to ward off the trouble caused by d@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ ord in French history , says N@@ o@@ r@@ a .
F@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ks and Gau@@ ls , A@@ r@@ m@@ a@@ g@@ n@@ a@@ c@@ s and Burg@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ i@@ ans , Cath@@ olic@@ s and Protest@@ ants : the forces of division in this country are very ancient .
And the most embl@@ ematic is clearly that which split national history in two :
since the u@@ p@@ heav@@ al of the Revolution , the French have had two histories and two nations - one m@@ o@@ n@@ arch@@ ic , the other revolutionary .
The second tried to kill off the first , but failed to w@@ i@@ pe it out ; on the contrary , it was wary of letting it r@@ e@@ discover its sac@@ red@@ ness and was so eager for unity and i@@ n@@ d@@ i@@ visibility that it cut off the head of the person who was the evident and powerful i@@ n@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ nation of the two .
And from there was born an i@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ bly biparti@@ te nation , split into left and right , lay and Catholic , a@@ d@@ oration and hatred for the Revolution .
To understand this unique aspect of the French identity , there is nothing better than taking a short trip outside of m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ politan France , so much so that Pierre N@@ o@@ r@@ a 's American venture could be the heart of his book .
This is because America and France have both had a revolution , drawn up a declaration of rights , and tried to found a new society .
However , our famili@@ a@@ r@@ ity with America only emph@@ a@@ s@@ ises even more something that is particular to us .
Over there , people abandoned their former rulers in England and did not have to bother about them any more .
Here , people were bothered by a native old power , and were all the more radical for it .
Over there , the revolution was consensual , where@@ as here it engendered tragedy and conflict .
There , the founding f@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ ers are still honoured , but here , our revolutionary a@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ors are hardly used as role models , besides , they killed each other .
There , there has been institutional consistency ; here there has been a torrent of constitu@@ tions , so many mistakes to correct and tests to repeat :
the France on the way out , the France in the making .
However , there has been a time when the French believed they could repair the damage done to their history and overcome the curse of the number two .
Pierre N@@ o@@ r@@ a has shown has shown great interest and even tend@@ ern@@ ess for this Third Republic : he salu@@ tes those who tried at the time to repair the divide created by the Revolution by teaching students about everything in the former France that o@@ b@@ s@@ c@@ u@@ rely pav@@ ed the way for the modern France , and by offering them a unified version of their history .
Yet , this paci@@ fied identity has had its day .
Here we are in debate once again , shaken by a new type of immigration , threatened by the i@@ n@@ f@@ low of protesting minorities , absorbed into the European framework .
The book thus offers both a fas@@ c@@ i@@ n@@ ating portrait of the France on the way out , and a circu@@ m@@ spect outline of the France in the making .
And , on top of that , there is the portrait of the historian , which should hold some s@@ u@@ r@@ prises .
It reveals that the w@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ er liked to stay at home .
The man of many c@@ u@@ r@@ i@@ o@@ s@@ i@@ ties is - slightly o@@ b@@ s@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ v@@ ely - focused on a single idea .
The one who p@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ led at the edges was standing in the heart of the centre .
And the man who rejected a notion of a nation over half a century ago , but who escaped from the initi@@ atory exercise of the phil@@ os@@ oph@@ ical work , c@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ i@@ des in us , c@@ u@@ m gran@@ o s@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s , that he has ended up doing it after all .
And so he has , but in a less formal , and more exploded and subtle form .
A form , which - make no mistake - is just as restric@@ tive ,
because , over and above the format imposed in the university course , this phil@@ os@@ oph@@ ical work speaks of the inner necess@@ ity of a life .
Former Hostage in Lebanon Says " C@@ o@@ m@@ ing Back is D@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ t to Hand@@ le "
J@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ alist J@@ e@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Louis N@@ o@@ r@@ mand@@ in was kid@@ napped on 08 March 1986 , along with three members of his A@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ ne 2 team who had come to film a Hezbollah demonstration , and was set free almost 21 months later , on 27 November 1987 .
He retired in 2008 , but in 2004 he helped set up a hostage defence association , " Ot@@ ages du M@@ o@@ n@@ de " ( " H@@ o@@ stages of the World " ) , which he has been running for several years .
The main objective of the association is to make it possible for hostages to press charges and bring their kid@@ napp@@ ers before the International Criminal Court .
Four A@@ Q@@ M@@ I ( Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Mag@@ h@@ r@@ e@@ b ) hostages , Daniel L@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ be , Thi@@ e@@ r@@ ry D@@ ol , Pierre L@@ e@@ grand and Marc Fer@@ et , were freed on Tuesday after being held for over 1,000 days .
Following medical examin@@ ations at the military hospital in V@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ de-@@ G@@ r@@ â@@ ce on Wednesday afternoon , they have now been r@@ e@@ united with their families .
Now they can gradually try to resume their lives .
" Le N@@ o@@ u@@ v@@ el Ob@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ ateur " interviewed 6@@ 2-year-old J@@ e@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Louis N@@ o@@ r@@ mand@@ in , a former senior reporter who retired in 2008 and is president of the association " Ot@@ ages du M@@ o@@ n@@ de . "
On the evening you were set free , you appeared on the mid-@@ evening news on A@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ ne 2 .
What are your memories of being set free today ?
On the ground specifically , in Beirut ?
The day I was set free , I was in the boot of a car where I met Roger A@@ u@@ que - although I couldn 't see him as it was dark .
He said " We 're free , " but I wasn 't sure and thought we might still be killed .
We were very excited , but also very tense .
It was in the middle of a war and the people driving us too were very tense .
They dropped us off on a pav@@ ement .
There were Syrian soldiers there .
We were then taken to the Hotel Sum@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ land where the press had gathered .
Some Fren@@ c@@ h@@ men took us to the French Embassy .
That was when I made my first call to my parents , my family , my friends , the press and so on .
I remember taking a one-@@ hour b@@ ath ,
and having dinner in a T-@@ shirt at the French Embassy .
I also remember a short night spent talking to Roger and M@@ a@@ r@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ ani .
It was still tense as there was no way of evacu@@ ating us to Lar@@ n@@ a@@ c@@ a airport in Cyprus .
We got there by helicopter and took a private plane to France via C@@ o@@ r@@ f@@ u and Sol@@ enz@@ ara , where Pas@@ q@@ u@@ a got on board .
How were you received when you got to French soil ?
We landed at O@@ r@@ ly .
C@@ h@@ i@@ r@@ ac , the Prime Minister , was there .
It was a bit rough ,
the j@@ o@@ s@@ t@@ ling was unbelievable .
And there was a lot of media .
When I left the country , there were three television channels -
when I got back there were loads of them .
C@@ o@@ m@@ ing down the steps of the aero@@ plane , being r@@ e@@ united with my son and parents , my friends , that was all very emotional .
Num@@ erous motor@@ b@@ i@@ kes followed our car , which was driven by Rou@@ s@@ s@@ in , from the airport to my home .
The b@@ i@@ kes were j@@ o@@ s@@ t@@ ling to get in front and take photos . They followed me all the way home , where I had to do some policing to stop some of them climbing up .
The media pressure was huge .
It wouldn 't stop and we were well placed to know that ...
Yet , the level of emo@@ tion and f@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ g@@ ue made it difficult to think clearly .
You come out of a hole and are suddenly in the spotlight of the media .
It 's a bit complicated , a bit of a shock , quite difficult to handle .
But we 'd been through the hardest part .
I was on the mid-@@ evening news that same evening , and on TV the following day as well .
Then a very gent@@ le sort of read@@ j@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ ment to life started , lasting one or two months that were a bit like a holiday .
How did the medical examin@@ ations and the d@@ e@@ briefing with the DG@@ SE ( Direct@@ orate General for E@@ x@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ al Security ) go ?
I had to undergo an initial medical check in C@@ o@@ r@@ s@@ ica .
The other tests were carried out in V@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ de-@@ G@@ r@@ â@@ ce in the days after my return : X@@ -@@ rays , examin@@ ations of every type , and an appointment with a psychi@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ ist .
Everything can 't be s@@ o@@ r@@ ted out in one appointment , but you know you can count on the psychi@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ ist , call on him if needed , that you have not been abandoned to yourself .
It is all part of the process .
I also met with the intelligence services .
They asked me a lot of questions about the hostag@@ e-takers .
It was normal .
It didn 't bother me .
How do you react today to the liber@@ ation of the four hostages in Nig@@ er ?
I 'm listening to what 's being said .
Especially the debate about r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ m@@ s .
Some things a@@ n@@ n@@ o@@ y me , others less so .
I try to distingu@@ ish between the questions about my past as a hostage and my role as president of the association " Ot@@ ages du M@@ o@@ n@@ de , " which enables me to keep a distance and seems to me more interesting to deal with .
For example , I think about the definition of r@@ e@@ s@@ i@@ lience .
And , I fight , alongside other people , for the recognition of the legal status of hostages .
I think there is a problem of s@@ e@@ m@@ antics .
We need to qualify hostag@@ e@@ -@@ taking as " political " hostag@@ e@@ -@@ taking - that 's what it is for the most part - and enable the hostages to have access to justice , to press charges and to bring their kid@@ napp@@ ers before the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is wrapped up in c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ s@@ sion , emo@@ tion and is r@@ e@@ j@@ o@@ i@@ c@@ ing that the hostages are free .
But who is saying that the hostages may also have access to justice ?
The court in The H@@ ague has been set up for that purpose .
Why should we not say to the hostag@@ e-takers : " You have f@@ l@@ o@@ u@@ ted the rules of war and those of all the Geneva Conventions , we 're going to bring you to justice " ?
I think that is justified , legitimate , plain common sense .
People hear the message , but do not listen , and that shocks me .
That 's my main struggle .
Egyptian Islam@@ ists Take to Stre@@ ets to Den@@ ounce Mor@@ si Trial
A@@ n@@ ger is brewing in the ranks of Egypt 's Islam@@ ists .
Two days before the start of the trial of deposed President Mohamed Mor@@ si , they took to the streets .
There have been demonstrations throughout Egypt to demand the rein@@ statement of the country 's first d@@ e@@ m@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ elected president .
" It 's not a trial , " says one Muslim B@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ hood activist .
" He has still not been able to see a lawyer and no volunteer has been able to get a copy of the case documents .
It 's not a trial , it 's a far@@ ce . "
" The trial of President Mor@@ si is a f@@ ake trial , " says an angry Mor@@ si supporter . " He should be having S@@ i@@ s@@ i tried , not the other way round .
Mor@@ si should try S@@ i@@ s@@ i for the mass@@ acres of Rab@@ aa , the mass@@ acres of Nah@@ da and the massacre by the Republican Guard .
S@@ i@@ s@@ i is a liar and a t@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ tor . "
Confront@@ ations broke out in Alexandria , where the police used tear gas and 60 demonstr@@ ators were arrested .
On Monday , 20,000 policemen were deployed in front of the Police Academy in Cairo , where Mohamed Mor@@ si will be tried .
Hag@@ el Acc@@ uses 9 US States of Vi@@ o@@ l@@ ating Hom@@ o@@ sexual Rights
Since the Federal government recogn@@ ised same-sex marriage , " all s@@ p@@ o@@ u@@ ses of military officers have a right to an identity card from the Department of Defense and to the associated benefits , " said the Secretary of Defense in New York , in a speech to the Anti-@@ D@@ e@@ f@@ a@@ m@@ ation League for the fight against anti-@@ Sem@@ itism .
" However , some states have refused to issue these cards to same sex s@@ p@@ o@@ u@@ ses in facilities of the National Guard " set up in their region , he criticised , accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality .
Without these cards , such individuals cannot take advantage of numerous social or healthcare services in these bases , or access the shops of the latter .
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard , General Frank Grass , to ensure that federal law was implemented .
The refusal by the nine states started with Texas , which refused to implement these measures in Tex@@ an National Guard facilities due to a conflict between Tex@@ an law and the federal law on same-sex marriage .
Indiana , Georgia , Florida , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , South Carolina and West Virginia , followed in refusal , according to a senior Defense official .
The Pentagon estimates that the population concerned by the recognition of same-sex marriage involves about 5@@ ,@@ 600 active individuals , or 17,000 if the National Guard , the reserve and retired people are included .

Toronto Mayor C@@ h@@ ases Off J@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ alists S@@ e@@ eking to Interview H@@ i@@ m on Drug Aff@@ air
In Canada , the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of using drugs , according to several media sources .
A video sent to the authorities seems to support these suspicions .
The man concerned , Rob Ford , has always denied having taken crack , but has admitted being partial to cannabis .
This Thursday he drove a number of journalists off his property when they came to interview him .
We also think that sometimes pictures need no explanation or comment .
Rab@@ ies Det@@ e@@ cted in Cat in V@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ d '@@ O@@ ise
Officials announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rab@@ ies had been detected in a kit@@ ten in V@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ d '@@ O@@ ise . The kit@@ ten must have come from abroad as France has not had any native cases of the disease since 2001 .
The kit@@ ten was found in Argent@@ e@@ u@@ il on 25 October and died on 28 October .
The diagno@@ sis of rab@@ ies was confirmed by the Pas@@ t@@ eur Institute .
" An epidem@@ i@@ ological inquiry was initi@@ ated to identify and treat any individuals who may have come into contact with the kit@@ ten between 08 to 28 October inclusive , " say the Minis@@ tries of Health and Agriculture .
" Five people who had been in contact with the kit@@ ten have already been identified , " and have received p@@ r@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ tive treatment .
" Preventive treatment for human rab@@ ies adminis@@ tered after contact with the carrier animal but before symptoms appear is very effective , " the press release speci@@ fies .
The m@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ tries are currently asking anyone who might have been bit@@ ten , c@@ l@@ a@@ w@@ ed , scratched or l@@ i@@ c@@ ked on a m@@ u@@ c@@ ous m@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ rane or on damaged skin by the kit@@ ten , or who own an animal that may have been in contact with the kit@@ ten between 08 to 28 October , to contact them on 08 11 00 06 95 between 1@@ 0@@ am and 6@@ pm from 01 November .
" France has been clear of rab@@ ies since 2001 . This kit@@ ten or the mother were imported from another country where it is still present , " says the press release .
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded ' native ' case of rab@@ ies was in December 1998 in a f@@ o@@ x and that " France was officially declared free of this disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health ( O@@ I@@ E ) in November 2001 . "
A case of rab@@ ies in a bit@@ ch illegally imported from the G@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ a was recorded in 2008 .
" Rab@@ ies is a fatal disease if not treated p@@ r@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ tly , " the m@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ tries reminded , and it can be transmitted during the fort@@ night or so before the first symptoms of the disease appear .
Obama 's Health Care Wal@@ k Back
A@@ m@@ i@@ d a firest@@ orm of criticism , President Obama yesterday walked back his o@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ repeated , u@@ n@@ ambigu@@ ous promise that " if you like your health plan , you can keep it . "
With hundreds of thousands receiving cancell@@ ation notices from their providers , Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public .
Yesterday , Obama t@@ weak@@ ed his original pledge .
" For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works , you can keep it , " he said in a speech in Boston .
Addressing what he called the " f@@ l@@ u@@ r@@ ry in the news " about the cancellations , Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace .
Most people are going to be able to get better , comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected .
" You 're going to get a better deal , " he said .
The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn 't meet the new standards required under the Aff@@ ordable Care Act .
" Let me say directly to these Americans : you deserve better , " S@@ e@@ b@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ us said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington .
S@@ e@@ b@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ us , who is overseeing implement@@ ation of the Aff@@ ordable Care Act , said the launch of the online marketplace has gone " m@@ i@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ ably " since October .
" I am as frustr@@ ated and angry as anyone , " she said .
I am eager to earn your confidence back .
An exasper@@ ated S@@ e@@ b@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ us u@@ t@@ tered that phrase , caught by a hot mic , to an aide seated behind her at yesterday 's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Bil@@ ly Long , R-@@ Mo . , over whether she should be required to e@@ n@@ roll in Ob@@ a@@ m@@ a@@ c@@ are .
More than three hours into the hearing , Long repeatedly pressed S@@ e@@ b@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ us on why the " archit@@ ect " of the Aff@@ ordable Care Act has not volun@@ tar@@ ily f@@ o@@ r@@ gone government@@ -@@ sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through Health@@ C@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ .gov , which she is now pitching to millions of Americans .
Vet@@ tel U@@ ses New Special Hel@@ met in Abu Dhabi
Lucky winner J@@ ake V@@ ite P@@ r@@ e@@ k@@ o@@ p combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag , while integrating the notions of speed and heat on the track .
German driver , Sebastian Vet@@ tel , q@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ r@@ u@@ ple Formula 1 World Champi@@ on , wore a special new h@@ e@@ l@@ met designed by a 21-year-old Mex@@ ican fan during the free practice sessions for the Abu Dhabi Grand P@@ r@@ i@@ x on Friday .
Vet@@ tel chose the winning entry from 1,500 designs sent in from all over the world as part of a competition run by one of the sponsors , a car brand in his stable .
The winner was invited to the Grand P@@ r@@ i@@ x in Abu Dhabi with a friend and was able to get up close to the German champion , both on the track and in the p@@ its .
Vet@@ tel was expected to wear the h@@ e@@ l@@ met in the practice sessions on Friday and Saturday .
He will probably have another special h@@ e@@ l@@ met for the race on Sunday designed to mark his fourth consecutive world title .
A@@ u@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ers R@@ e@@ s@@ i@@ d@@ ent La@@ u@@ n@@ ches " P@@ a@@ r@@ ti de la B@@ a@@ n@@ l@@ i@@ e@@ u@@ e "
Make no mistake ,
in the mind of its founder , A@@ b@@ del@@ -@@ M@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ k Dj@@ e@@ r@@ mou@@ ne , the " P@@ a@@ r@@ ti de la B@@ a@@ n@@ l@@ i@@ e@@ u@@ e " does not only target suburban residents .
" I chose a map of France as the logo , " he asser@@ ts .
" When I talk about suburbs , I 'm referring to all those who feel excluded from the larger national family . "
Be that as it may , his project , which was presented during a press conference in his home town of A@@ u@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ers on Thursday , was born from a desire to better defend m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ alism - the great cultural melting pot that , above everything else , character@@ ises these districts .
" My primary proposal is to create a Ministry of M@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ alism , " he says .
A@@ b@@ del@@ -@@ M@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ k Dj@@ e@@ r@@ mou@@ ne , a 50-@@ year-old regional a@@ t@@ t@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ é , today claims to be " 100 % apolitical , " although he has not always been neutr@@ al .
An activist supporter of J@@ e@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Pierre Che@@ v@@ é@@ n@@ ement in 2002 , he later supported Dom@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ que de V@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ e@@ pin in the district from 2010 to 2011 .
" I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my manifesto are associated with the Left , but if people on the Right are prepared to support me , I will listen to them too , " he continues .
" It is only extrem@@ ist parties that I will not talk to . "
Besides m@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ alism , A@@ b@@ del@@ -@@ M@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ k Dj@@ e@@ r@@ mou@@ ne has built his manifesto - which can be read on the Internet - around various subjects intended to appeal to suburban residents , especially the young : the right to vote for foreigners , the l@@ e@@ g@@ alisation of cannabis , lowering the voting age to 16 , restoration of the function of c@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ t@@ a@@ k@@ er , e@@ t@@ c .
He still needs to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas in the political arena . " It is likely that may be done just in time for the 2014 municipal elections , " he acknowledges .
" The problem is time and money .
However , the ' P@@ a@@ r@@ ti de la B@@ a@@ n@@ l@@ i@@ e@@ u@@ e ' should at least be represented in A@@ u@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ers through my candidacy and in other towns too I hope , " he adds .
A@@ b@@ del@@ -@@ M@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ k Dj@@ e@@ r@@ mou@@ ne claims there are already seven names on the candidate list in m@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ land France and in Mart@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ que .
" And the mail expres@@ sing support that I have been receiving since yesterday are not all coming from the suburbs , " he says with delight .
John Kerry says US s@@ p@@ ying has " reached too far inappropriately " in unprecedented admission
John Kerry has indicated a sof@@ tening of the U.S 's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its s@@ p@@ ying has " reached too far inappropriately . "
The Secretary of State also admitted that he 'd been guilty , along with Barack Obama , of being on " automatic pilot " as inc@@ e@@ n@@ diary revelations from whist@@ leblower Edward S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den about the N@@ SA 's s@@ p@@ ying activities emerged .
The l@@ e@@ aks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link , Mr Kerry said : " There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there , going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the C@@ old War , and then , of course , 9 / 11 . "
He then became the first high-@@ ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US s@@ p@@ ying had crossed the line , but emph@@ a@@ s@@ ised that no one 's rights had been a@@ b@@ used .
He said : " In some cases , it has reached too far inappropriately . "
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse .
I assure you innocent people are not being a@@ b@@ used in this process .
Mr Kerry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : " We 're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up . "
There is radical extremism in the world that is h@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ ent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments .
So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens ?
We have actually prevented airplanes from going down , buildings from being blown up , and people from being assassin@@ ated because we 've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans .
Meanwhile , U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. s@@ p@@ ying and convince the E@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ ans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S. , the chairman of a Senate s@@ u@@ b@@ committee on European affairs said on Thursday .
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-@@ terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency .
" It 's really important for U.S. national security interests for E@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ ans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism ende@@ a@@ v@@ ors , " Murphy , a first-@@ term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub@@ committee on European Affairs , said in an interview from Washington .
And I 'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in c@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ ing terrorism , n@@ o@@ t@@ w@@ ith@@ standing their anger over these N@@ SA programs .
News reports that the N@@ SA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have f@@ r@@ ayed relations with some U.S. allies , though the agency 's chief said this week that they were i@@ n@@ accur@@ ate and reflected a m@@ i@@ s@@ understanding of m@@ e@@ t@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ t@@ a that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States .
Other revelations cited documents leaked by S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ den that the N@@ SA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders .
The national intelligence director , James C@@ l@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ er , defended s@@ p@@ ying on allies as necessary and said it 's c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ place on both sides .
A@@ m@@ i@@ d the uproar , Murphy said his office is a@@ r@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ ing the congressional trip , expected to take place this year , and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers .
N@@ a@@ m@@ es of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days .
He said the itiner@@ ary is still being worked out .
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships , he said some " tough love " will also be dispens@@ ed .
He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espi@@ onage programs they 've used for years themselves .
" While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of E@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ ans , they also need to come to terms with the fact that we 're not the only ones that are out there s@@ p@@ ying , " Murphy said .
Meanwhile , Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria , Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities .
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday , with prices brought down by poor results from Shell the day after an announcement by the Fed that it would be maintaining its support for the economy , as planned .
Australian woman appeals Thai jail time
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phu@@ ket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail .
S@@ t@@ e@@ vie Rochelle B@@ a@@ m@@ ford was initially found guilty by a Phu@@ ket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver , with two other men r@@ e@@ s@@ training her , carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10 .
However , CC@@ TV foot@@ age later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend .
Phu@@ ket police interviewed B@@ a@@ m@@ ford for two days before she confessed to fab@@ ric@@ ating the story .
She was held in local police cells before the court hearing .
B@@ a@@ m@@ ford was sentenced to serve the 15-@@ day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phu@@ ket rather than in an adult women 's jail .
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tun@@ ks , who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter .
Tun@@ ks told Sydney 's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was " extremely concerned " about his daughter 's welfare and wanted her back in Australia .
" It 's obviously been a w@@ o@@ r@@ rying time but we 're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible , " Tun@@ ks said .
B@@ a@@ m@@ ford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 b@@ a@@ h@@ t .
Reports in Australia said that in the meantime , she was h@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ d@@ a@@ y@@ ing at the resort area of Kr@@ a@@ b@@ i in Southern Thailand .
T@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ -based legal sources said B@@ a@@ m@@ ford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phu@@ ket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison .
However , following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phu@@ ket , Thailand may also be looking to repair its bat@@ tered tourist image , leading to an acquit@@ tal .
French Police to Arrest Ander@@ l@@ e@@ cht Sup@@ porters Not Trav@@ elling in RS@@ CA B@@ uses
The French police have decided to impose strict rules ahead of the match between Royal Sporting Club of Ander@@ l@@ e@@ cht and Paris S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ G@@ e@@ r@@ main , set for Thursday , Marie V@@ e@@ r@@ b@@ e@@ ke , spokesperson for the B@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ s@@ -@@ South police district , said on Friday .
Belgi@@ an supporters of RS@@ CA who want to travel to the Champions League match will have to use the transportation system provided by RS@@ CA .
" The convoy of buses will be escor@@ ted by the police from a former frontier post at R@@ e@@ k@@ e@@ m to the P@@ SG stadium , " said the spokesperson .
The arrangement will be the same on the way back .
" If other supporters are intending to travel to Paris by other means , the French Police Department has said that steps have been taken to permit arrests to be made and people to be taken into custody , " Marie V@@ e@@ r@@ b@@ e@@ ke also announced .
Liv@@ ing together in French is the challenge facing the Commission S@@ c@@ o@@ l@@ a@@ i@@ re M@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ u@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ -@@ Bour@@ geo@@ ys ( M@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ u@@ e@@ r@@ ite Bour@@ geo@@ ys School Board ) .
At the M@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ u@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ -@@ Bour@@ geo@@ ys School Board , 62 % of students have a mother tongue other than French .
This is what inspired a consultation exercise between parents , students , teachers and staff of the education department a year ago to reflect on ways to improve the integration of students who have roots in several cultures .
The School Board has just unveiled its vision of " Liv@@ ing Together in French . "
The organisation , called Vision D@@ i@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ é , has been visiting schools for the past year to help students of every origin find common reference points that are not limited to the French language .
D@@ i@@ s@@ covering n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ hoods , our architecture , our environment are reference points ,
as are the names of great writers and artists , whether they are of French origin or come from elsewhere .
Who are our builders ?
" H@@ ence , we are developing projects such that they can identify with all of that , " explains the president of Vision D@@ i@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ é , A@@ ï@@ da Kam@@ ar .
M@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ el V@@ e@@ n@@ ne , from the I@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ t du N@@ o@@ u@@ v@@ eau M@@ o@@ n@@ de ( New World Institute ) has identified a number of challenges for the School Board .
" Shar@@ ing what Quebec culture is , for example , the sense of belonging , support for people going through the changes we are experiencing within the student body , " he lists .
The M@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ u@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ -@@ Bour@@ geo@@ ys School Board has created a research centre that will provide tools for teachers , who , themselves , sometimes come from elsewhere .
Rachida Az@@ d@@ o@@ u@@ z from the University of Montreal will be the scientific director .
P@@ r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ ation to manage a class in a N@@ o@@ r@@ th-@@ American and Quebec context .
" The real need is for different educational strategies , " she summar@@ ises .
The research will address i@@ n@@ c@@ l@@ u@@ sion from every angle : l@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ u@@ istic , educational , social and cultural .
