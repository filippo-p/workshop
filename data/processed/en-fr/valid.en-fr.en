A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Bren@@ nan Centre considers this a my@@ th , stating that electoral fraud is rar@@ er in the United States than the number of people killed by light@@ ning .
Indeed , Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter t@@ u@@ r@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ally undermine the American democratic system .
Unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registr@@ ation or voting process more difficult .
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 bills restric@@ ting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship .
Fur@@ thermore , these laws also reduce early voting periods , i@@ n@@ v@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ date the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record .
Before the 2006 elections , no US State required voters to show a photo ID card .
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement .
In 2008 , the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitu@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ ality of the Indiana law .
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States .
Over the past two years , they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card .
It is important to note that , unlike Quebec , American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card .
In fact , 11 % of American citizens , i@@ .@@ e@@ . 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State .
In addition , five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification .
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card .
The new restrictions d@@ i@@ s@@ propor@@ tionately affect young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
In fact , 25 % of African Americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35@@ ,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card .
And that 's not all .
Students , voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates , are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution .
On the other hand , these same States allow fishing or hunting club members , who vote more Republican , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
Prior to 2004 , no State required proof of citizenship to vote .
Arizona was the first to introdu@@ ce such a requirement .
Since 2011 , a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens .
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote .
However , it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic party .
What is more , in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws aboli@@ shing the registr@@ ation of voters on election day in eight States .
In addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register .
These restrictions are not without c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ e@@ q@@ u@@ ence .
For example , during the 2004 general election , voter registr@@ ation campaigns contributed to regis@@ tering around 10 million citizens .
However , the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registr@@ ation rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
In addition , Republican legislators have e@@ n@@ acted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period .
For example , during the 2008 general election in Florida , 33 % of early voters were Afr@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Americans , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the State .
The same applied to Hispanics .
These represented only 11 % of voters , but 24 % of citizens who voted early .
On the other hand , 76 % of voters were white but these represented only 46 % of early voters .
Of course , Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restric@@ ting voter registr@@ ation .
Several bills were blocked by vet@@ oes of Democratic governors .
The United States Attorney General interven@@ ed to suspend the most controversial laws .
They were able to p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ally limit the damage .
For example , only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card .
However , the new rules put in place will u@@ n@@ doub@@ tedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012 .
Democratic critics den@@ ounce the p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ san character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influ@@ encing the 2012 results in key States .
A 2011 Bren@@ nan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency .
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant i@@ m@@ p@@ acts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
But one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on the t@@ u@@ r@@ n-@@ out .
In this sense , the measures will p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ally undermine the American democratic system .
P@@ r@@ o@@ state cancer screening : take the test or not ?
Indeed , the P@@ SA test sometimes shows erron@@ eous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve u@@ n@@ necessary medical interventions .
E@@ n@@ ough to make already reluctant men hes@@ itate to take screening tests .
Take the test or not ?
We asked two specialists for their opinion .
In studies conducted in the United States , there was a lot of c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ m@@ ination between control groups , so it is difficult to interpre@@ t the data and make firm recommendations .
Another study , this time a European one , concluded that there was a difference in m@@ o@@ r@@ tali@@ ty between patients who were scre@@ ened and those who were not .
This study also showed , with a follow-up after 12 years , that it is between 30 and 40 % more likely for m@@ e@@ t@@ ast@@ ases to occur in the absence of screening .
I therefore recommend the test from age 50 , or 40 if you have a direct r@@ e@@ l@@ ative who previously had prostate cancer .
African-American men are also more at risk .
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected .
There are aggressive cancers and others that are i@@ n@@ d@@ olent .
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by offering him the options available , not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long-term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
Today , many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
Ac@@ tive monitoring will be suggested , and if the disease progres@@ ses , they will be offered treatment .
More and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated .
Ther@@ e@@ fore I recommend taking the test .
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it .
In collaboration with the S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ é@@ t@@ é i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ ale d '@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ e [ SI@@ U ] , Mov@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ er has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and c@@ o@@ n@@ s of the P@@ SA test .
You can download the document ( in English for the time being , a [ French ] t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ l@@ ation will be available shortly ) at this address : http : / / c@@ a@@ .@@ m@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ .com / f@@ r / m@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ -@@ health / p@@ r@@ o@@ state-@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ r@@ -@@ screening
Preventing the disease
Unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer .
Despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exer@@ cised enough , 30 % of cancers could be prevented .
" If no more people smo@@ ked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , " says André Beau@@ lieu , spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society .
On the other hand , it is estimated that roughly 10 % of cancers are her@@ e@@ d@@ i@@ t@@ ary .
Some are also completely u@@ n@@ explained .
For the Canadian Cancer Society , the fight against tobacco remains a priority , despite the decrease in the number of smo@@ kers .
C@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ t@@ tes are linked to 85 % of lung cancer cases .
It is also a risk factor for a number of others .
This mas@@ sively damages people 's health .
" Even today , there are 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Quebec " d@@ e@@ p@@ l@@ ores spokesperson André Beau@@ lieu .
E@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ aging data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drops by half .
W@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t
Over@@ weight and obesity are also conducive to the o@@ n@@ set of the disease , according to the S@@ C@@ C .
They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast , c@@ o@@ l@@ on and r@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ um , o@@ e@@ s@@ oph@@ a@@ g@@ us , pan@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ as and u@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ us .
" Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against c@@ o@@ l@@ on cancer " it is also said .
Diet
The organisation also recomm@@ ends l@@ i@@ m@@ iting your consumption of red meat .
In large amounts , it increases the risks of developing c@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ -@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ al cancer .
L@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ wise , so do c@@ u@@ red meat products , and these should be avoided .
The conservation of meat by smoking , d@@ r@@ ying or c@@ u@@ r@@ ing can cause the formation of c@@ a@@ r@@ c@@ i@@ n@@ o@@ g@@ ens .
" They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer " it is explained .
V@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ m@@ ins
In recent years , a number of scientists have studied the links between vitam@@ in supplements and cancer .
For the time being however their research is inconclusive .
Stu@@ dies on vitam@@ in E are contradic@@ tory , according to the S@@ C@@ C .
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer , another noted an increase .
Also the effect of vitam@@ in D on cancer is not clear .
In addition , Mr Beau@@ lieu emph@@ a@@ s@@ ises the importance of discus@@ sing your concerns and family history with your doctor .
" Taking a screening test doesn 't give you cancer . "
The H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s b@@ o@@ son revealed
The announcement of the p@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ able discovery of the H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s b@@ o@@ son created quite a stir last summer , and with good reason .
Indeed , it is believed that this b@@ o@@ son is part of the mechan@@ ism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe , no less .
Also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard M@@ o@@ del - our best or " less worse " explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed e@@ m@@ p@@ i@@ r@@ ically .
But for phys@@ i@@ c@@ ists , it is still not completely sure that it really is the H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s .
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authenti@@ c particle , and greatly r@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ les the H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s b@@ o@@ son predicted by the Standard M@@ o@@ del .
In addition , new data unveiled this week at a large phys@@ ics Congress in Ky@@ o@@ to seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure .
But let 's suppose that it really is the H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s , since the chances of being mistak@@ en seem sli@@ m , and see what it is .
In our world , there is a fatally u@@ n@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ able law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time .
There 's no way to break this rule - and don 't try too hard , you 'll go mad .
However , even though particle phys@@ ics is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the P@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ i exclu@@ sion principle , which states that two p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ les cannot occup@@ y the same space at the same time if they are in the same " quantum state " - this " state " consist@@ ing roughly of certain of their character@@ istics .
Based on this , phys@@ i@@ c@@ ists c@@ l@@ assi@@ fy p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ les into two categories .
In one corner we have good citizens called f@@ e@@ r@@ m@@ i@@ ons , who w@@ i@@ s@@ ely o@@ b@@ e@@ y the P@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ i principle .
While lur@@ king in the other are the b@@ o@@ sons , a nasty band of a@@ n@@ arch@@ ists who respect nothing - at all events , not this principle , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
These b@@ o@@ sons are then divided into two groups , according to the Berkeley Lab@@ s P@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ le A@@ d@@ venture site ( absolutely extraordinary , by the way ) : m@@ e@@ s@@ ons , which we will not discuss here , and " force p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ les " by which the great forces of nature are propag@@ ated and to which the H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s b@@ o@@ son may be somehow related .
These b@@ o@@ sons , it must be stressed here , are not all such exo@@ tic bugs as you might think .
In fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordinarily b@@ a@@ n@@ al b@@ o@@ son : the p@@ h@@ o@@ ton , or the " light particle " which is the " mess@@ enger " of the electrom@@ agnetic force .
When , in fact , a particle having an electric charge a@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ r@@ ates or changes direction , this " distur@@ bs " the electrom@@ agnetic field in this specific place , rather like a p@@ e@@ b@@ ble thrown in a pond .
This " distur@@ b@@ ance " produces an electrom@@ agnetic wave ( of light , infr@@ ared , ultraviolet e@@ t@@ c . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a p@@ h@@ o@@ ton - and thus one of the " force carrier " b@@ o@@ sons .
More stable field
The same applies to the H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s b@@ o@@ son , with the difference that it is another field , the H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s field , which must be " distur@@ bed " for the b@@ o@@ son to appear .
Now , this H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s field is much , much more stable than the electrom@@ agnetic field ; to e@@ x@@ c@@ ite it , it is necessary to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wrinkle the surface .
Which is why a huge particle a@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ r@@ ator like the one at C@@ E@@ R@@ N - the Large H@@ adron C@@ o@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ der is a ring with a 27@@ km circu@@ m@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ence ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
The anal@@ ogy with the electrom@@ agnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s and mass .
In fact not all p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ les , or all materials , i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ act with the electrom@@ agnetic field .
Some , such as magnets , do so , but others don 't - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a f@@ r@@ i@@ dge .
And like@@ wise , not all p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ les i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ act with the H@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ s field : those that do so have mass , while the others ( such as the p@@ h@@ o@@ ton ) do not .
Now , what is it that all this research " can bring " ? asks Ms P@@ l@@ a@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ don .
For science , it serves to check the vali@@ dity of the Standard M@@ o@@ del ( SM ) , and also allows phys@@ icians to examine any d@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ p@@ ancies between the observ@@ ations and predic@@ tions of the SM .
A number of people , m@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , f@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ ently hope that some will be found , because the sli@@ g@@ h@@ test difference could open a door to a " new phys@@ ics " and plug certain holes in the M@@ o@@ del .
This , it must be said , still has huge shortcomings , offering no explanation for gravity ( o@@ o@@ p@@ s ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the Universe ( r@@ e@@ -@@ o@@ o@@ p@@ s ! ) .
But to date no such d@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ p@@ ancies have been found at C@@ E@@ R@@ N .
R@@ e@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sions
The r@@ e@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ s@@ sions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict , but it would be wrong to assume that there won 't be any .
Remember : in the very early 60s , the pione@@ ers of the l@@ a@@ s@@ er at Bell Labor@@ atories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work .
They had an ink@@ ling of the scientific applications , but nothing as to the rest .
In fact , the late Will@@ ard B@@ o@@ y@@ le - a phys@@ i@@ c@@ ist who worked at Bell Lab@@ s , where the l@@ a@@ s@@ er was invented in 1@@ 9@@ 60 , and who himself developed the first continuous l@@ a@@ s@@ er ( the first were p@@ u@@ l@@ sed ) in 1962 - told us that initially the l@@ a@@ s@@ er was rather seen as a " lab gad@@ get . "
Just imagine ...
And then , applications can also come from all the instrum@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ation that s@@ u@@ r@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ ds research .
For example , the same Will@@ ard B@@ o@@ y@@ le developed a small light sens@@ or in 1969 , during his work in optics .
This sens@@ or , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an " eye " to all digital cameras worldwide , and earned him the Nobel phys@@ ics prize in 2009 .
This does not of course mean that the activities of the L@@ H@@ C will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care - The best way to die ... | Le D@@ e@@ v@@ o@@ ir
With its D@@ ying with Dign@@ ity Commission , Quebec recently discussed the d@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ate issue of the end of life .
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared .
However , in this vital area , much remains to be done .
Le D@@ e@@ v@@ o@@ ir attempted to look more closely .
Just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Mont@@ é@@ r@@ é@@ g@@ i@@ e apartment .
The f@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ing prostate cancer had allowed him a two-year r@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ ite .
" They gave me five years to live , I 've made it to seven , " he says , with mixed emo@@ tions , lying in his bed at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ b@@ o@@ is p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care home in Bel@@ o@@ e@@ il , where he arrived the previous day .
" But it 's still a shock , you can never be prepared for it " he adds .
The disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone , and even eating alone .
Sitting in front of an a@@ p@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ i@@ sing lunch , he consents to being helped to eat , resigned .
Cour@@ age@@ ous , he even m@@ a@@ n@@ ages to smile , talks to the strangers b@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ ling around him , bringing him his medic@@ ation , offering him a b@@ ath .
The courage of ordinary death .
" What I want most is to be c@@ u@@ red of my diarr@@ hoea , it 's h@@ u@@ m@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ating " he c@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ i@@ ded .
A few hours later , the team found a cure for this illness .
" During our lives , we learn that a man p@@ i@@ s@@ ses standing up , " says Pierre B@@ r@@ o@@ d@@ e@@ ur , psych@@ ologist at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ b@@ o@@ is home .
Reg@@ ressing to the stage of a child , for some people , is an unacceptable humiliation .
" It depends on the person 's ability " to accept the r@@ e@@ g@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ sion , he says .
Because , in the opinion of a number of people working in p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care , great moments occur at the very heart of such r@@ e@@ g@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ sion .
Patients at the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ b@@ o@@ is p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care home all suffer from cancer .
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months .
At this stage , the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called " c@@ u@@ r@@ ative " care .
For Mrs A. , 89 years old , the worst fear is to die " conscious and s@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ o@@ c@@ ating . "
But the disease has made me discover my children .
" I have fine children " she adds .
" I don 't wish for anything more in life " she says , before accepting having a mas@@ k put on to help her breathe .
She looks forward n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless , in the next few days , to a last visit by her son coming from Italy .
At Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ b@@ o@@ is , a group of volunteers provides bod@@ ily care and help with feeding .
This is p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care , given when there is nothing else that can be done .
To make death more comfortable .
In Quebec , there are p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care beds for 11,@@ 700 i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants .
This is very few when we know that we will all die one day .
Here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains Dr Chris@@ t@@ i@@ ane M@@ a@@ r@@ tel , one of the doctors at the home .
Whether at a physical comfort , emotional or spiritual level .
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink b@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ y or Pepsi , whatever is their t@@ i@@ p@@ ple .
D@@ i@@ a@@ b@@ e@@ tics no longer need to control their blood sugar .
And death is part of everyday life .
Yesterday evening , a beer was served to Mr X , who died during the night .
This morning , it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the dec@@ eased .
" We help relatives as much as patients " says N@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ e Sav@@ ard , Director of Care .
At the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ b@@ o@@ is home , one day follows another but no two are alike .
Along with a 9@@ 3-year-old man who is sav@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ ing his last meeting with his family , sitting firmly wed@@ ged in his pil@@ lows while t@@ o@@ asts are drun@@ k in his honour , a 36-@@ y@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ -@@ young man is dying t@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ ically , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two young children , after having tried everything to survive .
" For six months , there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old " says a concerned Dr Chris@@ t@@ i@@ ane M@@ a@@ r@@ tel .
53 % of patients admitted to the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ b@@ o@@ is home come from their homes , 47 % from hospital .
L@@ ack of access to p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care
It is said that 77 % of C@@ a@@ n@@ a@@ d@@ i@@ ans simply have no access to p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care , which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home .
And a number of organisations , such as the Vic@@ tor@@ -@@ Gad@@ b@@ o@@ is home and the P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Society in Greater Montreal , speci@@ alise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients .
It is precis@@ ely this large gap in Quebec health care which has made a number of p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care phys@@ icians fear the adoption of a law on euthan@@ asia and assisted suicide .
Since October , a manifesto , signed by p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care lumin@@ aries including Dr Bal@@ four Mount and Dr Bernard La@@ p@@ o@@ i@@ n@@ te , has been c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ ating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative .
According to Dr Chris@@ t@@ i@@ ane M@@ a@@ r@@ tel , the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthan@@ asia .
Rec@@ ently , she says , I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency , in great pain , without anything being done to ease her suffering .
I 'm afraid that patients ask to die because they don 't receive adequate care .
And at the same time , some o@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ ists work r@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ lessly on their patients until the last day , despite the worst progno@@ ses .
H@@ é@@ l@@ è@@ ne Richard 's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her g@@ r@@ u@@ elling chem@@ o@@ therapy .
When I announced to my o@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ ist that I was stopping the treatment , she told me she r@@ e@@ g@@ r@@ e@@ t@@ ted that I had given up fighting , she said .
However , she had told me I was finished !
No all-@@ powerful care
Dr M@@ a@@ r@@ tel believes that 90 % of patients asking to die than@@ k c@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ -@@ g@@ i@@ vers for not having a@@ c@@ c@@ e@@ d@@ ed to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care team .
But it must be said that p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative care is not absolutely all-@@ powerful in the treatment of pain .
According to E@@ l@@ s@@ i@@ e M@@ o@@ n@@ e@@ r@@ eau , P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Director with the P@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative Care Society in Greater Montreal , patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8 % of cases .
At the very end of life , phys@@ icians then often resort to p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative s@@ e@@ d@@ ation , which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death , either spor@@ adically or perman@@ ently .
We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering .
Incre@@ a@@ s@@ ingly , an u@@ n@@ relieved patient will have the option of having such p@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ ative s@@ e@@ d@@ ation .
Patients who are not relieved always say the same thing : " I want to die . "
But this does not necessarily mean " I want you to euthan@@ ise me , " it means " I want to be relieved . "

W@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ ad real estate scand@@ als in Quebec
Day after day highway officials , building contractors , political party fund-rais@@ ers and Italian m@@ a@@ f@@ i@@ a specialists tell what they know of a f@@ o@@ r@@ mid@@ able " system , " combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade u@@ n@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ ists and organised crime .
An " industry " which has cost Quebec taxpayers d@@ e@@ arly , especially in the 1990s and 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ s .
" It is c@@ u@@ r@@ i@@ ous how the system is crum@@ bling since we took drastic measures " says Jacques D@@ u@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ n@@ e@@ au iron@@ ically , a Quebec politician and former Montreal Chief of Police .
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in-@@ depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Quebec , to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time , Jean C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ est , had c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ ented only reluct@@ antly .
The " D@@ u@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ n@@ e@@ au report " established a direct link between industry , under-the-@@ table financing of parties and b@@ r@@ i@@ bery of officials .
" Since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the Ministry of Transport alone reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts , " with certain people curbing their instincts to get a share !
The C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ au Commission " has already brought down two may@@ ors " he adds , hoping that it will succeed in " revealing the schemes behind the individuals . "
A permanent anti-@@ corruption unit , created in 2011
The P@@ e@@ r@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ent Anti-@@ C@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ u@@ ption Unit , created in 2011 , is also c@@ o@@ u@@ pled with its army of government analysts , investigators , and auditors .
P@@ l@@ us the " M@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ au squad " policemen who , since 2009 , have apparently led the Montreal " s@@ e@@ w@@ er c@@ a@@ r@@ tel " to soft ped@@ al on the inflation of contracts ...
In recent weeks , it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as Frank Z@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ ino and Richard M@@ a@@ r@@ c@@ o@@ t@@ te , Mayor of a suburban town .
Next on the list is apparently G@@ i@@ l@@ les V@@ a@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ t , who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of L@@ a@@ v@@ al , third largest city in Quebec .
He is suspected of p@@ o@@ c@@ k@@ eting repeated b@@ r@@ i@@ bes in exchange for public contracts .
Others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs , including Tony Ac@@ c@@ u@@ r@@ so and L@@ ino Z@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ t@@ o .
The latter caused a sensation by explaining the mechan@@ ics of the public contracts " system " to the commission .
He himself paid 3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ medi@@ ary linked to the m@@ a@@ f@@ i@@ a who in turn paid the money to Union M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ é@@ al , Mayor G@@ é@@ r@@ a@@ l@@ d T@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ay 's party .
Mr Z@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ t@@ o has handed money out freely in the 2@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ s , giving over 8@@ 8,000 Canadian dollars ( roughly 68@@ ,000 euros ) to provincial parties , especially the Liber@@ als then in power .
He also admitted having organised an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal D@@ e@@ put@@ y@@ -@@ Prime Minister , N@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ e N@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ au .
S@@ e@@ w@@ er contracts with infl@@ ated costs
In Montreal , the corruption " system " ran smooth@@ ly .
G@@ i@@ l@@ les Sur@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ ant , former public works engineer , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he received from construction companies gifts , invitations to trips , golf tournaments , restaurants , hockey matches and b@@ r@@ i@@ bes totalling 7@@ 36@@ ,000 dollars , in exchange for s@@ e@@ w@@ er contracts of which he infl@@ ated the costs .
Other highway officials admitted having their pal@@ ms g@@ r@@ e@@ ased by infl@@ ating invo@@ ices by 30 to 40 % , and by false add-@@ ons .
Then an o@@ r@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ er of the Mayor 's party , Martin Dum@@ o@@ n@@ t , accused Mr T@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coff@@ ers with dirty money .
Following these revelations , Mr T@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ ay resigned in early November , plun@@ ging Montreal into a major crisis .
C@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ al Rou@@ l@@ e@@ au was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the a@@ l@@ arm .
Mayor of the borough of R@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ è@@ r@@ e@@ -@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ -@@ P@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ ries , to the East of the island , she p@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ ested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and r@@ e@@ s@@ old for ... 1.6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
70 % dirty money in election campaigns
On the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she " is following a thread in order to find out how the system - infil@@ trated by ants - works , to put a stop to the gan@@ g@@ r@@ ene and catch the c@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ r@@ its . "
The process , she says , is " painful but positive . "
The wound is being clean@@ ed , but Montreal would need its own investig@@ ative unit with ongoing monitoring , to avoid the return of these questionable practices .
How to clean house .
P@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ ly .
Jacques D@@ u@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ n@@ e@@ au notes for his part that " officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars , " but he is especially concerned about the role of " elected people aware of the scheme , " when they were not up to their n@@ e@@ cks in the scam !
E@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ ing the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec at 70 % , he says d@@ r@@ y@@ ly : " I was told that it was only a pale r@@ e@@ f@@ l@@ e@@ ction of reality . "
The Quebec government p@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ o@@ ses to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars , but this will not change the situation , he says : " Until election expenses are stric@@ tly limited , there will be dirty money in politics . "
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for gran@@ ting public contracts and party funding : " We can 't go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to rebuild the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . "
Although this story tar@@ n@@ ishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal , Mr D@@ u@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ n@@ e@@ au i@@ n@@ v@@ ites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard ...
" P@@ SG is not FC Barcelona ! "
This season , you have taken on a new stature with P@@ SG .
How do you explain this progres@@ sion ?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimen@@ sion of P@@ SG .
Some great players have arrived .
Every day I 'm making progress alongside them .
The technical staff has also brought me a lot .
Day by day , all these things help me raise my level of play .
And , in a match , it 's easier .
Everything moves very fast in football .
But I don 't get worked up .
From my debut at the C@@ l@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ e@@ f@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ aine I@@ N@@ F pre-@@ training centre to my transfer to S@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ E@@ t@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ ne , I 've always moved step by step .
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo Ancel@@ otti ...
This summer 's recruits are used to playing matches at a high level .
They also know that every training session is crucial .
Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best .
On the other hand , Carlo Ancel@@ otti gives me a lot as r@@ e@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ ds my position .
He 's supported by deputies like Clau@@ de Mak@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ le , who played in the same position as me .
Is Ancel@@ otti the man for the job ?
D@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ ely .
Ancel@@ otti insp@@ ires respect among all the experts .
Today he has no equal in Lig@@ ue 1 , and he 's one of the best coaches in Europe .
He has m@@ asses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs .
He 's worked with great players .
I think he will bring more titles to Paris .
In January , I had an encouraging discussion with him .
I was just coming back from a series of injuries .
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance .
What importance do you attach to the first part of the season for P@@ SG ?
In Lig@@ ue 1 , Lyon overtook us at the top .
But we 're waiting on the sidelines .
One of our main goals is the Champions League : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way .
What is the club 's goal in this competition ?
We 'll try to go as far as possible .
From now on , anything can happen .
But we 'll have something to say against some very good European teams .
First of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of Porto , to have home advantage in the last 16 match .
Can P@@ SG become a top European club in the short term ?
It already has the budget ...
To become a top European club , Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time .
Today , this isn 't the case .
F@@ i@@ n@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ ally , P@@ SG has the means to make it happen .
In Lig@@ ue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big failure ?
D@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ ely , it would be a major disappointment .
This year , we 're really committed to winning the championship .
We weren 't far away last season .
In May , there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first .
It was a terrific season .
We finished with 79 points .
N@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ ally , 79 points is good enough to be top ...
But another team , Mont@@ p@@ e@@ l@@ lier , had an even more fantastic season .
I think this is the year .
Even if big teams like Marseille , Lyon and Bor@@ d@@ e@@ aux are competing for the title , I think we have the weapons to win .
Do you think the media expect too much of P@@ SG ?
It 's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what 's been invested and the players we have .
We totally accept it .
After we won 4-@@ 0 at home against Tro@@ yes and they still found things to blame us for , that 's definitely a bit frustrating .
You wonder what more people expect .
You 're never going to win 4-@@ 0 every weekend .
We 're not FC Barcelona !
We 're trying to implement a game project .
It takes time to build a team .
The Champions League proved we could hold our own .
Look at Manchester City who , for two seasons , have failed to qualify for the last 16 , despite also having spent huge amounts !
Based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break !
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French Championship .
Lyon and Marseille , who were no good last season , were " boosted " by the new P@@ SG .
This shows that Lig@@ ue 1 is exciting .
I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
P@@ SG seem totally dependent on the exploits of Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic .
So much so that people say there is a " Z@@ lat@@ an depend@@ ence . "
This means I@@ bra@@ h@@ i@@ m@@ ovic is very successful and scores a lot of goals .
That 's why he came , and he 's proving he 's the star of Lig@@ ue 1 .
He 's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star .
Within the group , we respect the man and the player .
And also he respects the men he has around him .
What he has done is truly excep@@ tional .
It push@@ es others to raise their level of play .
Thi@@ ago Silva , who is one of the best defenders in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team ?
A disappointment .
I really wanted to play in this Euro .
Unfortunately , my injury prevented me from getting any game time .
I saw some things there and came out stronger .
Today , I 'm playing well in selection matches .
Which is what I 've been hoping for since my b@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ m with the Blues .
I 've learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now o@@ we it to myself to have exempl@@ ary behaviour .
What do think about Didier Des@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ m@@ ps 's first few months in charge of the Blues ?
He has the results he wanted .
We 're well placed in the World qualifying group .
The coach is tough , close to the players , and insp@@ ires them to win .
Like L@@ a@@ u@@ r@@ ent Blanc was .
But I don 't want to make any compar@@ i@@ s@@ ons .
Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro .
I hope Didier Des@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ m@@ ps will take the Blues to Brazil .
Did the good draw ( 1-1 ) sn@@ a@@ t@@ ched in Spain , on 16 October , represent a founding match ?
That match gave us confidence .
Everybody fought for everybody .
Before that shock in Spain , I 'd never experienced such a match in my career .
With B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in , pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
In addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is pal@@ p@@ able : the belief that the current monetary system , made up of banking monopoli@@ es , leads to financial c@@ r@@ ises .
In fact , B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in , invented by Sat@@ o@@ s@@ h@@ i Nak@@ amoto ( a p@@ s@@ e@@ u@@ d@@ o@@ n@@ ym ) , is both a virtual currency ( but convertible into dollars , euros ) and a secure exchange p@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ l like B@@ i@@ t@@ Tor@@ rent , which allows peer-to-peer file exchange .
Around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15,000 computers on the network .
Close to a thousand web sites accept bit@@ coins as donations or means of payment .
The bit@@ c@@ o@@ in exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in June 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a dozen dollars ( rates are listed on the bit@@ coin@@ c@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ ts@@ .com site ) .
Nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products .
However , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October .
It describes bit@@ c@@ o@@ in as " the most successful virtual currency , " " in competition with the dollar or the euro " and " similar to conven@@ tional currencies . "
B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ ers from other types of virtual currency such as ' credits ' , used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy ( and sometimes exchange in return ) .
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system .
But , on each occasion , a central authority controls and h@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ les the exchanges .
With B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in , all n@@ o@@ des in the network are both custo@@ d@@ i@@ ans of the book of accounts , auditors , currency i@@ s@@ s@@ u@@ ers , and buyers and sellers .
How does the network operate ?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e-mail .
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anonymity .
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-@@ key e@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ y@@ ption system .
So the network can v@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ fy the authenti@@ city of the transaction .
Using the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bit@@ coins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network .
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book .
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers , and the winner , a kind of interim central banker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line .
This is a file h@@ ashing phase , i@@ .@@ e@@ . the transformation of a large file into a shor@@ ter and unique digital i@@ m@@ print .
Compu@@ ters " take " the new transaction and add a number to it , then " h@@ ash " it all up .
The goal being to find the number that gives a special i@@ m@@ print ( lots of zer@@ os at the beginning ) .
Once this number has been found , the other n@@ o@@ des can easily check that it is the right one .
The transaction is then i@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ bly linked to the chain of all the other transactions ; any modification would alter the i@@ m@@ print .
If a user wanted to defraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be vali@@ dated by the network - the other would remain an orph@@ an because the two have different i@@ m@@ prints .
The computer that resol@@ ves the challenge wins 50 bit@@ coins .
To avoid inflation , this award is regularly divided by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
The number of bit@@ coins in c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ ation is therefore limited to 21 million , but they are d@@ i@@ visible down to the hundred m@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ th , which leaves some margin ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power .
The life of the network has had its u@@ ps and downs .
Web@@ sites providing services for B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in have been attacked and bit@@ coins in deposits stolen .
" The l@@ o@@ o@@ p@@ hole used is not the p@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ l itself " says Pierre N@@ o@@ i@@ z@@ at r@@ e@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ u@@ r@@ ingly , who has just launched Pay@@ m@@ i@@ um , a real currency payment company that uses the B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in network .
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service .
But cash also has this weakness .
Major players like Wiki@@ pedia refuse donations of this nature .
Others , such as the W@@ o@@ r@@ d@@ Press blog platform , accept them .
Rec@@ ently , A@@ di S@@ h@@ a@@ m@@ ir and Dor@@ it Ron , from the W@@ e@@ i@@ z@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ n Institute in Israel , analy@@ sed the accounting books and showed that almost 80 % of bit@@ coins do not c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ ate .
In November , " huge s@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ -@@ offs " were launched .
" Thir@@ ty thousand dollars were exchanged " w@@ e@@ l@@ comes Jon Hol@@ m@@ quist , who works for C@@ o@@ i@@ n@@ a@@ b@@ ul , which conver@@ ts bit@@ coins to gold .
Pierre N@@ o@@ i@@ z@@ at , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network .
His system , Pay@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ i@@ a , is equivalent to a credit card ( in real money ) or a c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ less payment by mobile , but it uses B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in to vali@@ date transactions , which are thus cheaper .
Also the user m@@ a@@ n@@ ages his identity and can therefore be anonymous .
The system is easy to implement by m@@ e@@ r@@ chants , who do not need to install new terminals or software .
They just need to provide an address that a phone can " photograph and recognise " says Pierre N@@ o@@ i@@ z@@ at , who confir@@ ms he has thousands of users .
There is a general movement to r@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ r@@ aise h@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ arch@@ ical systems for more h@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ z@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ al systems .
" It will take time for B@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ in to become firmly established , but 2@@ 0@@ 13 could be a turning point , " he predic@@ ts .
The ECB , in its report , says it will r@@ e@@ assess the various risks , currently regarded as high , in the event of the currency 's success .
We got out of Afghanistan .
What now ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( Kap@@ i@@ s@@ a and Sur@@ o@@ b@@ i ) .
NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014 .
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future , without expecting us to do everything .
It is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists .
And ourselves , with our 88 soldiers killed , plus the wounded , the m@@ a@@ i@@ med .
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former leaders in refuge in Pakistan , but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the S@@ o@@ v@@ i@@ ets .
They want to defend their traditions , both ancient and arch@@ aic , even though they have been joined by J@@ i@@ h@@ a@@ d@@ ists , Pakistan@@ is , Arabs , U@@ z@@ b@@ e@@ ks , T@@ aj@@ i@@ ks .
T@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ r@@ ated , sometimes assisted , by local insurgents , the latter will no longer be so when Wester@@ ners become more scar@@ ce .
The departure of French troops from the Ni@@ j@@ r@@ a@@ b base , which I observed from the top of hills of a@@ l@@ mond trees planted with French funding , was carried out in an orderly fashion .
C@@ o@@ n@@ v@@ o@@ ys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked , o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ flown by helicopters .
There will be no wave of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014 .
Cir@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ s@@ t@@ ances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996 .
At that time Kabul was empty , the country being torn apart by the strugg@@ les between different f@@ a@@ c@@ tions .
Their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liber@@ ation , a return to safety .
A@@ f@@ g@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ is paid the price of the obsc@@ u@@ r@@ antism of these peasants by the organisation of Al-Qaeda , but their situation has not improved today .
Former M@@ u@@ ja@@ h@@ i@@ d@@ in , the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are allied in the desire to keep women in an i@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ior position .
The main anti-@@ Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001 .
They became profit@@ eers , s@@ e@@ izing government land to resell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan , bene@@ fiting from huge American outsourcing contracts .
They have become d@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ d@@ ited ; what is more , most of them did not fight themselves .
The people , as I heard in the countryside , want a Government that is not made up of thiev@@ es .
Many young people want to leave , as those who were able to benefit from American l@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ s@@ se will leave : the flight of capital is considerable .
The young people are tired of war and its i@@ d@@ e@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ es .
They have rub@@ bed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan , and appreciated the benefits .
Rou@@ g@@ h@@ ly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; Kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the total population .
In towns and cities , the state schools are full , with girls and boys alike .
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obsc@@ u@@ r@@ antism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders .
All of them , including the armed opponents , are partial to mobile phones ; television , with its Turkish s@@ o@@ a@@ p operas that show a modern world , is followed everywhere .
The army is now present .
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate ?
Former commanders of the anti-@@ Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias , which will escape the central power .
Afghanistan , land of mountains , with strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain d@@ e@@ centr@@ alisation , in the image of the Western nations , but the United States wanted to turn it into a centr@@ alised State , with strong presidential power , aboli@@ shing the post of Prime Minister , which had existed since the 1964 Constitution .
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls , particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014 .
But , since the 50s and already well before , his country has been dependent on foreign aid .
No industries have been r@@ e@@ -@@ established , no dams are in good condition , no major i@@ r@@ rig@@ ation systems have been repaired .
Everything is imported ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables .
The P@@ r@@ i@@ ority is left to private initiative .
In a country ruined by thir@@ ty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary .
The rum@@ our was spread that Afghanistan had huge m@@ i@@ n@@ eral wealth .
This only added to the feeling that the Wester@@ ners were only there to seize it .
With no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it across the mountains , there is no mining .
The Chinese have already almost left the M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak copper mine , leaving international archaeologists ( funded by the World Bank ) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province .
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan , on which imports and exports largely dep@@ end , to restore normal relations .
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November .
The new cooperation treaty provides for the c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ u@@ ation of traditional aid : girls ' high school , boys ' high school , French Department at the University , French Institute , cooperation in the military , legal , medical and agricultural fields , support to the arch@@ ae@@ ological Deleg@@ ation .
Since 2009 , to try to " win hearts and minds " and achieve the impossible task of reconc@@ iling aid and offensive actions , a " c@@ i@@ v@@ il-@@ military actions " service from the Ministry of defence ( Cim@@ ic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small French NGO , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages .
These projects , involving large numbers of local lab@@ our , have helped to contain the insurgency : i@@ r@@ rig@@ ation , wells , drinking water , r@@ e@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ation , fruit trees , soil protection and increase in cultiv@@ able areas .
What will we leave as a souvenir , after two billion euros of military spending ?
A much more modest budget would contribute to impro@@ ving local living conditions , which are very hard in these v@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ e@@ ys often located over 2,000 metres above sea level .
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kap@@ i@@ s@@ a province .
To be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups , which is what farmers told me they want , a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour , well controlled and directly affecting them .
A Constitution by force in Egypt
A new gam@@ ble for President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration , which temporarily grants him full powers , he has decided to go for broke .
Taking everyone by surprise , he announced on Wednesday that the C@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ ent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day .
Just a week ago , the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work .
For two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text , a@@ m@@ ended several times and this has weak@@ ened institutional stability and led to legal i@@ m@@ b@@ r@@ o@@ gli@@ os .
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country .
According to his opponents , the President is p@@ e@@ r@@ sever@@ ing in his " auto@@ cratic deli@@ r@@ i@@ um , " continuing to " go back on his word " and ' t@@ r@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ le the law . "
His supporters affir@@ m that this is the quick@@ est way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by speeding up the transition process .
A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks .
A very short period , which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the Egyp@@ tians .
For the President , it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legi@@ tim@@ acy while the dispute r@@ ages throughout the country .
Mohammed Mor@@ si seems convinced that Egyp@@ tians will vote favour@@ ably , as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time .
P@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ arly since a has@@ ty vote s@@ m@@ acks of an ultimatum to the Egyptian people : " Either you vote for my text , or I keep full powers , " these powers suppose@@ dly e@@ x@@ p@@ iring following adoption of the Constitution .
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the C@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ ent Assembly , with a large Islam@@ ist majority , voted on the text yesterday .
Most of the liber@@ als were missing .
In mid-@@ November , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had slammed the door , feeling they had failed to a@@ s@@ sert their views .
Representatives of human rights , religious minorities or civil society had done like@@ wise .
In order to obtain a q@@ u@@ o@@ r@@ um , 11 members , altern@@ ates , were has@@ tily added yesterday morning .
Some of them are very close to the Muslim B@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ hood .
Not surpris@@ ingly , the articles were for the most part voted unanimously .
Comment@@ ators were also a@@ m@@ used that one of the only diver@@ sions of the day was expressed with regard to ... the hour of prayer , some Committee members feeling that the C@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ ent Assembly clock was wrong .
The text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 234 articles .
The main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution , s@@ t@@ i@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ating that " the principles of s@@ h@@ aria are the main source of law . "
The Sal@@ a@@ f@@ ist parties , for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim , were hoping to replace " the principles " by " the rules , " which would have allowed stric@@ ter application .
For the Islam@@ ists , the fact that this article was not a@@ m@@ ended is a guarantee of their good@@ will and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society .
" Hy@@ p@@ o@@ cris@@ y " respond the liber@@ als , who see only a communication coup .
Because in their opinion Islam@@ i@@ s@@ ation of the Constitution is done through other articles .
They refer in particular to article 220 , which grants Al-@@ Az@@ h@@ ar University an advisory role , with particular reference to v@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ fying the c@@ o@@ n@@ formity of the laws with s@@ h@@ aria .
According to Egypt specialist S@@ ophi@@ e Pom@@ m@@ i@@ er , this is w@@ o@@ r@@ rying because " the people called upon to advis@@ e are not elected and have no democratic legi@@ tim@@ acy .
This suggests the b@@ e@@ g@@ innings of a t@@ h@@ e@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ y . "
The liber@@ als ' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next R@@ e@@ ctor of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one .
" For the time being , there is no concrete religious i@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ation .
With this Constitution , things remain under civil rule .
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law scholars but academics , some trained in the French system " quali@@ fies Alexis B@@ l@@ o@@ u@@ et , who is writing a thes@@ is on the Egyptian constitutional transition .
But he acknowledges that " there may be some ambigu@@ ity regarding article 220 , because the terms used borrow from the religious voc@@ abulary .
R@@ e@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ence is made in particular to " f@@ i@@ q@@ h " [ Islamic juris@@ p@@ r@@ u@@ d@@ ence , Editor 's note ] .
And the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pron@@ ounce on it . "
Beyond its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic .
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime .
Another issue : the powers c@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ red on the army .
In accord@@ ance with the wishes of the military , the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament , but to a National Defence Council .
Nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military t@@ r@@ i@@ b@@ u@@ n@@ als , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
Who also voice their concerns about the text , which they consider repres@@ sive .
The offence of b@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ p@@ h@@ e@@ m@@ y is maintained and insul@@ ts are now prohi@@ bited , which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
In addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights H@@ e@@ ba Mor@@ ayef , from Human Rights Watch .
In her opinion , the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36 .
The word was not included in the previous Constitution .
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
Sup@@ porters of the Head of State will march on Saturday .
In Israel , holy places await U@@ k@@ rain@@ ian tourists , the o@@ m@@ p@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ os and a sea of s@@ a@@ l@@ ine water
The Holy Land combines the spl@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ our of bibli@@ cal t@@ r@@ u@@ ths , modern comfort and p@@ r@@ i@@ m@@ e@@ v@@ al nature .
A@@ i@@ F [ Arg@@ u@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i i F@@ a@@ k@@ ti ] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel .
Let 's worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the River Jordan where J@@ e@@ s@@ us was b@@ a@@ p@@ tized .
It is considered that all who enter this b@@ a@@ p@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ m " b@@ ath " are blessed by God .
G@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ lee is the place where J@@ e@@ s@@ us performed his magic : turned water into wine at a wedding , walked on water , calmed a storm , and filled the nets .
This is also where J@@ e@@ s@@ us came before his disciples and after the resur@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ tion .
But the biggest number of holy places is in Jerusalem .
Beli@@ e@@ v@@ ers walk through the Way of Gri@@ ef or Via Dol@@ o@@ r@@ o@@ sa .
It starts by the Antonia Fort@@ ress - Pra@@ e@@ t@@ orium - where the judgement took place , and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy S@@ e@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ c@@ h@@ re on Gol@@ g@@ o@@ tha - the place of the cruci@@ fix@@ i@@ on , Stone of U@@ n@@ ction and the place of J@@ e@@ s@@ us ' burial .
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian o@@ m@@ p@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ os , which symbo@@ l@@ i@@ zes the salv@@ ation of m@@ a@@ n@@ kind .
The Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is e@@ r@@ e@@ cted at the site that , according to Christian l@@ e@@ g@@ end , yi@@ e@@ l@@ ded the tree used to make the cross for J@@ e@@ s@@ us ' cruci@@ fix@@ i@@ on .
Jerusalem has the most holy places for the Jews as well - the W@@ a@@ i@@ l@@ ing Wall , which remained from a t@@ e@@ m@@ ple destroyed by the R@@ o@@ m@@ ans in 70 A@@ D .
According to tradition , people of different f@@ a@@ i@@ ths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled .
Travel along a vertical
Ru@@ ins of the M@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ a@@ d@@ a Fort@@ ress remain from a secret refuge from enemies , built by Her@@ od in 25 BC for his family .
They are located on c@@ l@@ i@@ ffs in the mountains at an elev@@ ation of 450 m above sea level .
They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing .
Others are delivered to this historical moun@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ top by a cab@@ l@@ e@@ way .
In the north of the country , at an elev@@ ation of 1@@ 6@@ 00-@@ 2@@ 0@@ 40 m , there is a famous ski resort called Her@@ mon , which f@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ s up with tourists in winter months .
A shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain .
The total length of ski p@@ i@@ s@@ tes is 45 km .
According to an ancient l@@ e@@ g@@ end , p@@ a@@ g@@ an g@@ o@@ ds used to live on the mountain .
Visit unique museums
This country has about 300 museums .
You won 't be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit .
Among them - Museum of Israel , located close to K@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ et ( Parliament ) .
It has ancient Q@@ u@@ m@@ ran m@@ a@@ n@@ u@@ s@@ crip@@ ts and Dead Sea s@@ c@@ rolls found in the caves of the J@@ u@@ dean desert , along with about 500,000 arch@@ ae@@ ological and anthro@@ p@@ ological a@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ facts .
The Museum of Art in Tel@@ -@@ Aviv is also interesting .
Its exhi@@ bits include a wide range of impres@@ sion@@ ists and expres@@ sion@@ ists like M@@ o@@ n@@ et , P@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ o , Ren@@ o@@ ir , S@@ i@@ s@@ ley , Ce@@ z@@ anne , M@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ se , M@@ o@@ dig@@ l@@ i@@ ani , C@@ h@@ a@@ g@@ all , Picasso .
In Ak@@ ko , you can visit the b@@ ath museum Al-B@@ a@@ s@@ h@@ a , which c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ ists of several rooms of ancient Turkish b@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ s with models of visitors and b@@ ath a@@ t@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ants of the time .
In Ca@@ e@@ s@@ area , it is worth visiting the unique private R@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ i Museum , where you can enjoy the sculptures of D@@ ali and R@@ o@@ d@@ in .
There are no tour guides or gift shops .
E@@ n@@ try is free of charge , and contributions are stric@@ tly not allowed .
The fifth one is the Hol@@ ocaust Museum or Y@@ ad V@@ a@@ s@@ hem in Tel@@ -@@ Aviv , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history .
The most tragic section is the children 's memorial , built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentr@@ ation camps and gas chambers .
You go in and find yourself in complete darkness .
Stars are g@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ mering ,
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died .
Ukraine is mentioned there too .
Well@@ ness
There are three resort areas in Israel , located on the coasts of the Mediterranean , Red , and Dead S@@ e@@ as .
Each have swimming pools , aqu@@ a parks , dol@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ aria and o@@ c@@ e@@ a@@ n@@ aria .
It is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months , because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees .
The Dead Sea is even warmer , and people swim in it all year round .
I@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ally , it is the most unusual sea in the world , located in the lowest point of the planet - 4@@ 17 m below sea level .
Its a@@ z@@ ure water is s@@ a@@ l@@ ine and easily keeps you afloat , even if you don 't know how to swim .
The surrounding landsc@@ apes are surreal in their beauty .
People come here to undergo a course of treatment using salt water - wraps and medic@@ inal m@@ u@@ ds , and to improve their health if they have d@@ e@@ r@@ m@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ tis , aller@@ gies , a@@ s@@ t@@ h@@ m@@ as , e@@ c@@ z@@ emas , arthri@@ tis , b@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ tis , or diabetes , or to return emotional balance .
Tou@@ ch the my@@ ster@@ ies of a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ quity
They are p@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ ved in the old section of Tel@@ -@@ Aviv - in the town of J@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ a on the Mediterranean Sea .
The famous sea route connecting Egypt , Syria , Anat@@ olia , and Mes@@ opo@@ tam@@ ia runs through it .
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends .
According to legends , this is where Noah built his a@@ r@@ k and P@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ e@@ us saved the beauty A@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ o@@ m@@ eda , with whom he lived a long and happy life .
Tour@@ ists really like to wander the narrow streets named after signs of the zo@@ d@@ i@@ ac .
They say , if you touch the walls on the street of your sign , fortune will come to you .
In J@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ a , you can meet new@@ l@@ y@@ w@@ e@@ d@@ s who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions .
And in Ca@@ e@@ s@@ area - the city of King Her@@ od - you can walk around a Roman theatre , " capture " the C@@ rus@@ a@@ d@@ er fort@@ ress .
During the Roman period , Ca@@ e@@ s@@ area was the main city of J@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ a and the residence of Roman p@@ r@@ e@@ f@@ ects , including Pon@@ t@@ i@@ us Pil@@ ate .
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances .
A note for the tourist
When you go to Israel , don 't worry about your bad English knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country 's population speaks Russian .
For the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily exchanged for s@@ h@@ e@@ k@@ els ( currently 1 dollar = 3.8 s@@ h@@ e@@ k@@ els ) .
City transportation is mainly buses , but Jerusalem has a high-@@ speed t@@ r@@ am , and Hai@@ f@@ a has the only subway line in the country , c@@ o@@ m@@ prising six stops and connecting upper town with lower .
In essence , it is an underground cable railway .
A ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 s@@ h@@ e@@ k@@ els , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers .
According to the Jewish tradition , Sab@@ b@@ ath is celebrated in Israel .
Between Friday evening and the sun@@ set on Saturday , markets , stores , and public transportation stop working .
The work week starts on Sunday morning .
Many caf@@ es , restaurants and hotels have only k@@ o@@ s@@ h@@ er food , with no pork , seaf@@ ood , fish with no s@@ c@@ ales , or dishes that combine milk with meat .
There is a wide selection of dishes from lam@@ b and beef , s@@ o@@ u@@ ps and d@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ ts c@@ o@@ o@@ ked using c@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ ut milk , traditional Jewish h@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ us paste , various s@@ a@@ u@@ ces , fal@@ a@@ f@@ el ( balls made of ground c@@ h@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ peas ) , fruits and vegetables .
The streets of Israel don 't have homeless dogs .
But there are many well-@@ fed cats , which walk around l@@ a@@ z@@ ily .
In the evening , they can even be seen sleeping on roof@@ s of p@@ a@@ r@@ ked cars .
These pus@@ s@@ y@@ cats like busy places and do not refuse treats .
C@@ ar rental , depending on car type , costs from 37 ( Hyundai Get@@ z ) to 188 ( Audi A@@ 6 , Vol@@ v@@ o S@@ 80 ) dollars a day .
P@@ l@@ us insurance of 15 dollars a day .
B@@ i@@ ke rental costs 15 s@@ h@@ e@@ k@@ els a day .
Museum entrance costs 30 s@@ h@@ e@@ k@@ els on average .
In numbers
In 2012 , over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel .
Visitors and h@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ day@@ makers arrive mostly from the USA , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , England , and Ukraine .
Between January and October 2012 1@@ 18,@@ 800 U@@ k@@ rain@@ ian tourists visited the Holy Land , which is 51 % more than a similar figure in 2010 , before the removal of the visa regime on February 9 , 2011 .
Only the " high and m@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ty " make it to Moscow : migrants save money for language
While deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing , the country already has scam artists who sell f@@ ake certi@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ates .
Every year , 13 million migr@@ ant workers come to Moscow , St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia .
M@@ o@@ s@@ t@@ ly these are citizens of Central Asia : U@@ z@@ b@@ e@@ k@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an , T@@ aj@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an and Turk@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an .
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home .
A new law came into effect on December 1 , which oblig@@ es every migr@@ ant worker to pass a Russian language test .
For the moment , this law applies only to those who intend to work in services , housing and utility services , household services , and retail .
But with time - as promised by the Federal M@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ ation Service - tests will become mandatory for all non-@@ residents .
In addition to language , Russian history and basics of the legal system will be tested .
L@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ u@@ age knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit .
An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language .
People who received education certi@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ates and diplom@@ as before the fall of the US@@ S@@ R in 1991 are also exempt under the law .
Pur@@ pose , doomed fate , and the protection of rights
Seven testing points will be operating under the a@@ u@@ s@@ p@@ ices of the P@@ ush@@ kin Institute of Russian L@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ u@@ age , Peoples ' Friendship University of Russia , Moscow State University ( M@@ G@@ U ) , St. Petersburg State University ( S@@ P@@ b@@ G@@ U ) , and other Russian education institutions .
M@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ ants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ es have been opened .
The initiative to introdu@@ ce the testing was supported by State Dum@@ a members and the Federal M@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ ation Services .
But human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non-@@ residents ?
First of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from lab@@ our sl@@ avery .
Many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants , explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal M@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ ation Services of Russia , Viktor S@@ e@@ bel@@ ev .
Rights protection should begin before their departure .
Only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
M@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ ants without profession , education , who do not know Russian , who do not have a medical certi@@ ficate start to have problems .
If a migr@@ ant does not understand the language , says S@@ e@@ bel@@ ev with certainty , he is doomed to come across u@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ c@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ ous people , who , p@@ r@@ e@@ tending to help , will force upon him a " ticket " to terrible , cramp@@ ed barr@@ acks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , sl@@ a@@ v@@ ing away 12-@@ 14 hours a day .
We receive many complaints from our migrants .
" They are promised one thing at home , but when they arrive , they are lied to , their passports are taken , they are not paid what they were promised , " confir@@ ms the Head of the Main M@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ ant Labour Administration of the M@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ ation Service of T@@ aj@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an T@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ b S@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ p@@ o@@ v .
Not be angry , boss !
Non@@ etheless , many citizens of Central Asian countries , who plan to go to work in Russia , admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , this is not so much their fault , but due to poverty : very few Turks , U@@ z@@ b@@ e@@ ks , and T@@ aj@@ i@@ ks can afford even a basic education .
Their families don 't even have food to feed their children , not to mention decent clothing , shoes , and supplies .
After reaching a@@ d@@ o@@ l@@ escence , these kids go to work at the first opportunity .
It is hard , if language knowledge is bad , they admit .
" You feel h@@ u@@ m@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ated and i@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ior . "
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language .
T@@ esting will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status .
If they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the future .
In the meantime , most of the migr@@ ant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
" Wel@@ come , or No Unauthorized E@@ n@@ try "
Many of the foreigners a@@ s@@ sert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy .
The reason lies in bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and the already mentioned language difficulties .
In addition , l@@ e@@ g@@ alization costs money : from 12,000 to 16,000 r@@ u@@ bles .
W@@ h@@ ere@@ as a f@@ ake registr@@ ation is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand .
Officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have f@@ ake papers , without registr@@ ation , hence the extortion .
" They ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes , tea , " U@@ med Kh@@ ush@@ k@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ m@@ ov , a citiz@@ en of T@@ aj@@ i@@ k@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ an , shared with journalists .
" Roll up , don 't be cheap , get your artwork "
On the first day of the law 's entry into effect it turned out that not only migr@@ ant registr@@ ation documents can be f@@ ake .
A few forged certi@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal M@@ i@@ g@@ r@@ ation Services officers already .
F@@ o@@ r@@ g@@ ed documents are printed on a standard colour p@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ter .
N@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ally , they were not free for their owners : each of the migrants , who had hoped to facili@@ tate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand r@@ u@@ bles for them .
It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing , which costs three thousand .
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certi@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ ates could not just be bought .
For the moment , the authorities can promise migr@@ ant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course .
In addition , those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ ation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tough@@ en up the law for owners of civil weapons .
This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents : CL@@ IC@@ K shots at wed@@ dings , where there were no casualties , and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmi@@ try Vin@@ o@@ grad@@ ov , resulting in CL@@ IC@@ K the death of seven people .
Polic@@ e@@ m@@ en want to prohi@@ bit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 .
The idea was supported by the head of the Dum@@ a Committee on Safety and Anti-@@ C@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ u@@ ption , Ir@@ ina Y@@ a@@ r@@ ov@@ aya , who promised that the amend@@ ments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Dum@@ a in the near future .
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by " tightening the scre@@ ws . "
An open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of different social rifle organizations - demand to abandon the " s@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ ess tough@@ ening . "
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal , said criminal lawyer V@@ a@@ s@@ ily Les@@ n@@ i@@ k@@ o@@ v to BBC Russia .
According to the Ministry of the Interior 's statisti@@ cs , 1@@ 4@@ 2 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , where@@ as 1@@ ,@@ 1@@ 6@@ 8,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period .
Auth@@ ors of the open letter are certain that the tough@@ ening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the " black " market .
According to them , one can find any weapon at a low price right now .
Non@@ etheless , the Ministry of the Interior asser@@ ts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control .
Supp@@ l@@ i@@ ers : from plants to officers
The " black " market of weapons is r@@ e@@ p@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ ished through several channels .
There are five such channels , explains retired colonel Viktor B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ets , who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years .
Scre@@ e@@ n@@ shot of the site that accepts orders for weapons .
First : " army or military l@@ o@@ o@@ t , " i@@ .@@ e@@ . weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus .
" W@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ ons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucas@@ ians , " says B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ets .
Next are " black weapons , " stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies .
B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ets explains that this covers weapons taken from police w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies ' employees .
Il@@ legal arms are taken to be sold from military w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses .
E@@ x@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ sions have often been heard at military w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses .
" There are proven theories that some of the fires were intentional , in order to cover the shortage , " says the former military man .
Manufacturers of weapons make their contribution , according to B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ets .
" There are so many private weapons factories now , which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in Moscow , " says the expert .
Another source of the " black " market is traff@@ icking .
An especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Ky@@ rgy@@ zstan .
" There 's production there , sometimes h@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ made ; and a m@@ a@@ f@@ i@@ a has formed , which has organized a stream , " explains the former military man .
Where do the weapons come from ?
Experts counted the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the " black " market .
A report about this was prepared by the Centre of P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ l@@ e@@ m@@ s Anal@@ ysis and Public Management P@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ ing in 2011 .
Experts analy@@ sed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Ros@@ stat , crimin@@ ology literature and open data from p@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ als on weapons .
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
Half of all arms on the black market are there " because of officials , whose work is connected with weapons , " states the report .
According to researchers ' data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is theft during production , 5 % is " black arch@@ ae@@ ology . "
A sales consultant of one of the weapons stores , who wished to remain anonymous , asser@@ ts that the weapons found by " black " d@@ i@@ g@@ g@@ ers are not being bought any more , because they 're too old .
According to him , dealers go to the military warehouse for a new bat@@ ch of goods .
One piece , for example a T@@ T gun can be bought from a warrant officer .
It is issued to him , and given through the fence .
" He takes it to the city and sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines , " he says .
" The truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why perio@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ ally , when the crime d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ction rate is low , it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons m@@ e@@ r@@ chants , " says the consultant .
" Like in a luxury store "
The buyer and seller often find each other through friends .
I looked at sites , blogs , t@@ i@@ l@@ l someone responded , offering me to go to B@@ e@@ g@@ o@@ v@@ aya station , where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the " corner " so we can negoti@@ ate .
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military comment@@ ator Viktor B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ets
To get a weapon , I need someone with conne@@ ctions , says the sales consultant . - I have an acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ ance , but I 'm not sure it 's reliable .
There are s@@ a@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ men on lab@@ our markets , but one needs to " come " there condi@@ tionally " from John Do@@ e , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a t@@ o@@ o@@ th . "
Right now , even if I need a few knuc@@ kle@@ d@@ u@@ sters , I get them through someone I trust .
He also supplies them only to me , because he knows that I won 't give him away .
Beg@@ i@@ n@@ ners look for weapons in different ways .
Former military man Viktor B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-@@ 1990 's , when he was preparing to publish an article about this .
The formul@@ as are still the same , according to him .
He was given an album of pictures with " anything and everything . "
" I felt like I was in a luxury store , " he recalls .
According to B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ets , the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke - you can try out everything .
I , the potential client , am not just buying ; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there .
" I am given the opportunity to shoot , and when I am certain that the weapon is good , we begin to negoti@@ ate , " describes the expert .
Store on a sofa
Internet searches lead to sites and " V@@ kon@@ t@@ a@@ k@@ te " groups , where weapons " for different purposes " are on offer .
No documents or personal meetings are needed .
" It 's enough to have a certain sum of money , " says the advertisement heading on the website " Buy a pistol or rifle . "
Users leave their requests and ask questions .
Can a minor buy ?
" Without a license , of course , " asks user " John " ( name is changed ) .
" Want to buy a T@@ T , Moscow , " c@@ o@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ ely requests " Fed@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ k@@ o@@ v . "
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of f@@ ake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
People come like hungry fish to bait , and then mine coal in Siber@@ ia .
military comment@@ ator and former military man Viktor B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ets
I heard about this : normally the site is registered outside the area of a@@ p@@ p@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ability of the laws of Russia .
People accept orders .
The buyer pays at an AT@@ M .
" In response , a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden , " says Press Secretary of the Rights to W@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ ons non-@@ governmental organization Dmi@@ try Kis@@ l@@ o@@ v .
Viktor B@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ets confir@@ ms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to jail .
The Federal Security Service now s@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ ads a big network of f@@ ake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons .
" People are like hungry fish after bait , and end in Siber@@ ia mining coal , " - he says .
Mak@@ a@@ r@@ ov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal firearms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts .
According to Dmi@@ try Kis@@ l@@ o@@ v from the Rights to W@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ ons organization , a Mak@@ a@@ r@@ ov gun can be acquired for 100@@ -@@ 300 dollars .
The wait time is a month to a month and a half .
It is shipped from long-term storage w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses by the mid-@@ level management of these w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses .
According to official statisti@@ cs of the authorities , the number of such crimes in Russia on the whole dropped 7 % as compared to Jan@@ u@@ ary-@@ October 2011 , a@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ ting to 2@@ 2,9@@ 00 , while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons , ammunition , explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7@@ .@@ 8 % .
Fas@@ t@@ -@@ food and supermarket workers are on strike in the U.S.@@ A .
Up to a fourth of all American teenagers have worked the cash register at McDonald 's at one time or another
In the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the U.S.@@ A. against low salaries in supermarkets of the Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like McDonald 's , Bur@@ ger King , T@@ aco Bell , Wend@@ y 's and Kentucky F@@ r@@ i@@ ed Chick@@ en .
Right now , nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ined to f@@ i@@ z@@ z@@ le out early .
Ac@@ tions are being supported by unions and a series of left-wing organizations .
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t and fast food chains , the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them .
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet .
46 cents a year ?
Ac@@ tions began last week after Thanksgiving , on Black Friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in America , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
On this day , some employees of the Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t corpor@@ ation , which employs 2.2 million people around the world , left their w@@ o@@ r@@ k@@ places and p@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ e@@ t@@ ed together with the unions and left-wing activists from the corpor@@ ation stores that sell products to people on low-@@ to-@@ medium incomes .
Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t sells everything imagin@@ able , from diap@@ ers , hunting rif@@ les and car batteries , to vacu@@ um clean@@ ers , eggs and milk .
Products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in major supermarkets .
So many low-@@ paid Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t employees shop only at their workplace .
Avail@@ ability and a@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ ment made Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t one of the biggest American corporations .
According to critics , Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees .
These latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example lack of lift trucks and hand-@@ held scanners .
Protest@@ ers on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corpor@@ ation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
A typical Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t employee , receiving 9.@@ 5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
Scienti@@ sts from the Berkeley University in California argue that if Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corpor@@ ation 3@@ .@@ 2 billion dollars .
This is about 1.1 % more than it spends on salaries right now .
If Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more .
In one year , they will only spend 12.@@ 39 dollars more than now .
Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t supporters happily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corpor@@ ation .
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday t@@ i@@ l@@ l midnight the next day , and during the period Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t sold about 5000 products a second .
In total , its cash r@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday .
Representative of the corpor@@ ation , Dan Fog@@ e@@ l@@ man , asserted in an interview with a left-wing site , the Huff@@ ington Post , that a total of " less than five " Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t employees left the workplace , and the protest act was just " another PR trick " of the union that organized it .
" Free cash register ! "
Protests continued this week in New York , where their object was not Wal@@ m@@ a@@ r@@ t ( they 're not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they don 't exist here yet ) , but McDonald 's and other cheap restaurants .
McDonald 's says that it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work !
J@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ ane Williams , member of the City Council of New York
At the moment , the minimum salary according to federal and NY law is 7@@ .@@ 25 dollars an hour .
Fast food restaurants increase it with time , but very little . On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.@@ 90 dollars / hour .
Nobody e@@ a@@ r@@ ns less in this expensive city .
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money .
Once upon a time , almost a fourth of American teenagers went through McDonald 's , working part-time after school , living with parents .
Few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long .
Now I continuously come across interviews with McDonald 's employees , who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children .
On the other hand , there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum , whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them .
Participants of the protest that began at 6.@@ 30 a.m. on Thursday near the McDonald 's on 40@@ th street and Madison Avenue demanded that c@@ a@@ s@@ h@@ i@@ ers and c@@ o@@ o@@ ks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i@@ .@@ e@@ . more than double their present wages .
They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry .
American law prohi@@ bits the administration from preventing this or punishing activists of the union movement by n@@ agging or firing .
On the other hand , the administration does not often ease their life .
But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union .
One of them is the unusual turnover of employees .
D@@ i@@ s@@ agreeing
N@@ o@@ i@@ s@@ y protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan .
The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near McDonald 's by Times Square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . One of them , J@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ ane Williams , said : " McDonald 's claims it sells billions of portions , and despite this it doesn 't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! "
Demonstr@@ ators were supported by other prominent NY d@@ e@@ m@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ ats , like Bill de B@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ i@@ o , a candidate for NY city mayor , who said : " We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic w@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ being , which every New Y@@ o@@ r@@ ker deserves ! . "
According to the New York Times , this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry .
But only a few hundred people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York .
It is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement .
" At the moment , the mind cannot be dec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ed too well "
Among modern technology fans a popular topic is augment@@ ed reality , lately seen primarily through the p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ m of special glasses .
At first , a functional model was shown by Google in the summer , at its annual conference . Then , in November , it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for pat@@ ent too .
However , according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft , Shah@@ ram I@@ z@@ a@@ d@@ i , glasses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .
They are drawn by the prospect of manipul@@ ating virtual objects in the air with bare hands , creating virtual open spaces .
- Please tell us , in simple terms , about the work your research group does .
- We work on the interaction of people with machines , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction .
While people in general are stuck at working with p@@ i@@ x@@ els on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them .
We want to look 5-@@ 10 years into the future and predict cardin@@ al changes in this interaction .
For example , Xbox and Kin@@ ect sens@@ ors are a step forward . Almost no Xbox is sold without Kin@@ ect today , because everyone likes control by gest@@ ures .
- What else awai@@ ts us in the future ?
- Despite the fact that Kin@@ ect shifted the interaction to the physical level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3D .
Information entry has improved ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .
We are trying to change this , working on truly three-@@ dimen@@ s@@ i@@ onal display systems based on various technologies , including projection technologies .
We need to let the computer world into our physical world , make it more tangible .
But for this , we need to identify both the user and the space around him .
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form .
Above all , get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets !
- What do you think about voice control ?
It 's a popular thing , but is it o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ estimated ?
- It clearly cannot be called a c@@ u@@ r@@ e@@ -@@ for-@@ all - there 's a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions .
In reality , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own n@@ i@@ che .
For example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we thought about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
M@@ o@@ v@@ ements were not recorded by a camera , but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and muscles .
It 's big right now , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch .
In general , the future lies in the mixed control , e.@@ g. movement + voice .
- What do you mean ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water ?
You will talk and show at the same time .
- Usu@@ ally I just say .
- Oh , that will be very hard to detect .
- So you want to make the users adap@@ t to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mutual a@@ p@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ m@@ ation .
I think in the near future , we will mainly work on developing new sens@@ ors that will enable more precise determination of a person 's reaction .
This could be , e.@@ g. l@@ a@@ s@@ er sens@@ ors . They have a decent depth resolution , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kin@@ ect sens@@ ors , what are your complaints about modern cameras ?
Not enough resolution , depth or something else ?
- In general , the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three-@@ dimen@@ s@@ i@@ onal recognition .
Of course , it would be good to have eight mega p@@ i@@ x@@ els with 1000 k / s speed .
It 's not just the mega p@@ i@@ x@@ els , though , but the quality of the m@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ x and the depth .
From the latter point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the alg@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ h@@ m design@@ ers .
So it 's important to remember about the resolution on the X , Y , but also the Z ax@@ is .
Speed , the number of images per second , is also very important .
Human movements are relatively dynamic , and the current 30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gest@@ ures .
Steven B@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ i@@ che from our Red@@ mond laboratory created a touch sens@@ or with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sens@@ ors are closer to the latter indicator ( 60-@@ 100 ) .
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine .
In my work , it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second .
- Does the number of cameras need to be increased ?
- In Kin@@ ect there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an infr@@ ared e@@ m@@ itter and the second one , the recipient of the signal .
The third one is actually a regular sens@@ or of visible range .
It is not applied to determine the object 's depth .
Potenti@@ ally , a large number of cameras could solve the problem ...
Or make it worse , by increasing the required volume of calculations .
It would be nice to create a flexible anal@@ o@@ g@@ ue Kin@@ ect , play with the fle@@ x@@ i@@ on of camera d@@ i@@ s@@ position and see how this will help in three-@@ dimen@@ s@@ i@@ onal determination of the position .
- As far as I remember , Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public , unlike Google .
Don 't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augment@@ ed reality technologies ?
- Cert@@ ainly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time , but I think that the cool@@ est option would be " transi@@ tional " augment@@ ed reality , where you could shift from glasses to smart phone , projection display , and everywhere else based on a cloud platform .
Gl@@ asses are a very personal device , that is their strength ( private things are seen only by you ) and , at the same time , their weakness - augment@@ ed reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people .
- Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual h@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ c objects in the air is available not only to Tony Star@@ k from I@@ ron@@ man , but to a regular person .
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out : no tacti@@ le feedback !
Hands feel nothing !
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge ?
- In my lectures I often say that augment@@ ed reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine .
I think that the eighth will probably be the addition of tacti@@ le sens@@ ations .
For now , one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of m@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ x for the image .
It is great at regis@@ tering push@@ es !
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these " images in the air " a sense of tan@@ gibility , for example , the interference of several targeted ultr@@ a@@ s@@ ound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation , but very weak right now , as if someone blew on your finger@@ tip .
There are also w@@ rist brac@@ elets that affect the ner@@ ve endings in fingers , which is also a promising area .
- Have you tried to dec@@ eive the mind ?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something ?
- This is a good idea and we haven 't tried this yet .
It conce@@ als one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limit@@ less space ; we are working on the concept of t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ mills ( not at all like in clubs ) , moving platforms , and giant ballo@@ ons .
So far dec@@ e@@ i@@ v@@ ing the mind has had limited success , there 's work for many years to come .
That 's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very b@@ e@@ g@@ innings .
Jud@@ g@@ ement calls instead of culture - Ros@@ b@@ a@@ l@@ t@@ .@@ ru
Ros@@ b@@ a@@ l@@ t continues the project St. Petersburg A@@ v@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ -@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ de , dedicated to residents who are ahead , in the avant-garde of culture and art .
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg , whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city , often recognized in Europe , by@@ passing fame in Russia .
The new player in Ros@@ b@@ a@@ l@@ t - the bold artist Kir@@ ill Miller .
The whole city knows Kir@@ ill Miller , a b@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ ded man dressed all in red , who can be seen by the Russian Museum , or by the Sum@@ mer Garden , or at fashionable parties and shows .
Kir@@ ill Miller 's work always brings in crowds of people , no matter where they are exhibited .
Kir@@ ill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and phil@@ os@@ oph@@ ical story@@ t@@ ellers and creators of new my@@ t@@ h@@ ology .
Kir@@ ill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80 's early 90 's .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , he is a city man , who makes people smile on the street and lif@@ ts up everyone 's spirit .
Rec@@ ently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg 's music man , because he was ready for this complex role with all his B@@ o@@ hem@@ ian existence , philosophy and image .
- Kir@@ ill , why do you walk around the city all in red , not yellow or t@@ u@@ r@@ q@@ u@@ o@@ ise , for example ?
- I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image .
In this world , red is a compromise between artist , imag@@ e@@ -@@ maker and society .
Although in society , everything that is not grey causes aggression and a@@ g@@ itation of the bad kind .
But my provoc@@ ations are aimed at starting conversation .
The whole history of my provoc@@ ative actions is an invitation to discussion .
- When did you r@@ e@@ alise that you must be an artist ?
- At an exhibition in the Nev@@ sky House of Culture , where my work was displayed .
It became clear to me that this is my path .
Then , the wave of older free , unofficial artists was gone , while new , free artists like me were not understood .
I became friends with the artists of the new wave , with post-@@ Gaz@@ a@@ -@@ Nev@@ sky style artists ( " post-@@ gaz@@ o@@ n@@ e@@ v@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ ina " ) , which led to Push@@ kin@@ s@@ k@@ a@@ y@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and the wave was no longer .
I 'm drawn to theatre , clothing , music , all g@@ e@@ n@@ res except for literature .
- And all this has been united in your A@@ r@@ t@@ -@@ clinic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg , where all the best creative forces should come together .
In 1995 , I occupied the territory on Push@@ kin@@ s@@ k@@ a@@ y@@ a@@ -@@ 10 , and while the renovation work had not started , there was a musical and creative club , a B@@ o@@ hem@@ ian club , the house of the St. Petersburg B@@ o@@ hem@@ ia .
Many were born there : NO@@ My , Tequila Jazz , I remember when S@@ h@@ n@@ ur was brought there with the Van G@@ o@@ gh 's E@@ ar project .
S@@ h@@ n@@ ur and his friends l@@ i@@ p sang easy songs , wearing tight l@@ e@@ o@@ t@@ ards , and the now trend@@ y composer Igor V@@ d@@ o@@ vin was with them .
When the group began to play live , it became Len@@ ingr@@ ad .
T@@ r@@ a@@ k@@ h@@ tenberg was the presenter of many programs before H@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ -@@ Gal@@ i times .
We gave them T@@ r@@ a@@ k@@ h@@ tenberg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ oring he received from us .
Gallery D 1@@ 37 , Gri@@ boy@@ e@@ d@@ ov club - all these ech@@ o the A@@ r@@ t@@ -@@ clinic .
That is where our staff and regular customers left for .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something .
In 2000 , there was a poll in the press , for the People of Our City prize .
I was nominated A@@ r@@ tist of the Year , my c@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ a@@ x came to an end .
In the new times , it is uncomfortable to work by old rules . I 'm a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century .
In our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are different . You can be popular , but not very cultural .
- Your work is marked by a recogni@@ zable style .
- Many of my works are hits , with clearly reflected r@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ v@@ ance and acu@@ ity .
I will have a programme exhibit , " Russian museum in c@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ns . "
C@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ns are a tim@@ eless category .
I was social before , now it is painful and scary to be like that .
But everything is blur@@ red in c@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ns , tragedy is removed .
I like g@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ esque , I have g@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ esque ideas .
For example , saving the world by t@@ o@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ tari@@ an changing of clothes by order .
Now@@ a@@ d@@ ays , people are judged by appearance , not their inner qualities .
Who knows , maybe you cannot shake his hand , and need to spit in his face .
And the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes .
- Rec@@ ently we saw you in the role of music man . - A cultural city should have such a character .
Who fits the role better than I ?
- Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful ?
- Now@@ a@@ d@@ ays , commercial art should be neat , consider@@ ate , sweet .
There is a disintegration of cultures .
People used to get together in f@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ks , B@@ o@@ hem@@ ians liked one thing , the simple people , something else .
Now , everybody is divided into mic@@ r@@ o s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ eties , it 's hard to be liked by everyone .
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all .
Now you have to think who you will please .
Now , each cult hero has 100 fans .
- But several thousand come to S@@ t@@ as Mik@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ l@@ o@@ v !
- The c@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ outs go to see him , the sexu@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ social sphere is at work there .
But 300 people will come for culture , not 10,000 . In the end , there 's less management , money , everything dies out .
I have fans ; the main thing is not to betr@@ ay them , not to s@@ p@@ o@@ il what I have earned .
In my youth , I painted such art that one collect@@ or had it hanging on the same wall with Fal@@ k and L@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ ov .
I started with paintings , which people usually end with .
C@@ o@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ ts are often mixed up these days .
People say : spiritual culture , consumer culture .
There is no culture in c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ u@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ ism , it 's " from another opera . "
I am a man of yesterday 's culture . I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of pain@@ ting .
This is the culture I 'm for .
- Kir@@ ill , what is St. Petersburg missing ?
- Good cultural experts .
There is such a thing : an official for culture .
But not everyone can be engaged in culture .
Under the right rulers everything was different . Kings may not have understood culture very well , but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts .
There are good consultants in Moscow right now .
Here in St. Petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are needed , who will c@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ ly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
Jud@@ g@@ ement calls are what thrive now .
Even Er@@ art , but they 're different because they say hon@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ly that we don 't accept all modern art . There are some artists , who need to find other museums for themselves .
- What does St. Petersburg mean to you ?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital , Moscow has much more culture , there is bedro@@ ck there .
It 's hard for art to grow on our rocks .
We need cultural bedro@@ ck , but we now have more writers than readers . This is wrong .
In Europe , there are many c@@ u@@ r@@ i@@ ous people , who go to art exhi@@ bits , concerts .
Here , this layer is thin .
We need to make art fashionable , as it was in the beginning of last century .
The project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant .
Give birth in space
The earth is in danger .
Global warming or an encounter with a killer a@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ id .
C@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ ans of cosmic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet .
To save h@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ity , the question is how to propag@@ ate our race in conditions of weightlessness or on that replacement planet ?
I think the choice is small .
There are only two actual plan@@ ets that can be explored even hypo@@ thetically .
" Venus and Mars , " says Senior R@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ cher of the P.@@ K. S@@ h@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ berg State Astron@@ omy Institute ( GA@@ IS@@ h ) Vladimir Sur@@ d@@ in .
But while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life , Venus has 500-@@ degree temperatures .
Life is possible only at a high altitude or on the orbit of Venus ... in space .
The question of reproduction in space began with f@@ l@@ ora .
Half a century ago , experiments were run on plants .
Four gener@@ ations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earth counterparts .
Then , inse@@ c@@ ts were b@@ red in orbit , small fruit flies .
In 1979 , quail eggs were sent to space , to check how an embry@@ o develops in weightlessness .
We get an absolutely normal c@@ h@@ ick .
But then the problem begins .
" The problem is related to the fact that this c@@ h@@ ick needs to find support , needs to get on its feet and start moving , " explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ l@@ e@@ m@@ s ( IMB@@ P ) R@@ AN Vladimir S@@ y@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ v .
Having found no support , c@@ h@@ icks were tum@@ bling around in disorder .
After 10 hours , the new@@ b@@ o@@ r@@ ns experienced complete a@@ t@@ r@@ oph@@ y of instincts .
Chic@@ ks did not react to light and sound .
And the problem was that they simply died after four days .
" We b@@ red c@@ h@@ icks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , " says Vladimir S@@ y@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ v , confir@@ ming the failure of the exper@@ iment with c@@ h@@ icks in space .
The last biological " mini-@@ a@@ r@@ k " with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago .
In spring 2@@ 0@@ 13 , experiments will continue .
However , only same-sex beings will be on the B@@ i@@ on b@@ i@@ o@@ -@@ satellite .
There was an exper@@ iment with rats , who were sent to space with f@@ o@@ e@@ t@@ us .
In principle , there was nothing extraordinary there .
" This was on b@@ i@@ o@@ -@@ satellites , but again , it was a s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ular exper@@ iment and such research needs to be conducted , " says Vladimir S@@ y@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ v .
After landing , the cosmic rats had babies .
But it 's hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space .
It 's not an easy task .
A@@ n@@ i@@ m@@ als simply cannot follow their sexual instinct , when they 're out of their familiar environment .
In principle , people , unlike animals , can .
Hom@@ o s@@ a@@ p@@ i@@ ens have abstr@@ act thinking , and are able to create a fitting emotional background .
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons .
But women have been flying to space for 50 years .
The biggest risk was for Ter@@ esh@@ kova .
The most valuable thing for h@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ity is the female body .
Our " S@@ e@@ a@@ g@@ ull " left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space .
Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight .
" Nobody answered this question , " says rocket and space industry veteran , V@@ a@@ k@@ h@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ g V@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ a@@ d@@ ze .
In June 1964 , only a year after flying to space , the first woman in space Val@@ entina Ter@@ esh@@ kova gave birth to a daughter .
The child 's father , A@@ n@@ d@@ r@@ i@@ an Nik@@ o@@ l@@ a@@ ev , was also a cos@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ aut .
In 1988 , the second woman cos@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ aut , S@@ vet@@ l@@ ana Sav@@ i@@ t@@ s@@ k@@ aya , who went into orbit twice and even worked in open space , gave birth to a son .
However , the risk remains .
We have few , very few cos@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ a@@ u@@ ts , who were OK and had healthy children after long flights .
" What 's more , it is dangerous even for orb@@ ital flights , " adds pilot and cos@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ aut , Her@@ o of the US@@ S@@ R , Her@@ o of Russia , Val@@ ery Poli@@ a@@ k@@ ov .
And yet , h@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ity needs to seek out some new a@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ u@@ es in bio@@ technologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial gravity .
Hy@@ d@@ r@@ o@@ -@@ laboratory of CP@@ K - mandatory phase of training for a flight .
Here , cos@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ a@@ u@@ ts practice skills of working in open space in zero-@@ gravity conditions .
Water i@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ ates weightlessness .
If for adults water is a foreign medium , although comfortable , for infants it is a native element .
Sm@@ all a@@ m@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ b@@ i@@ ans seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean .
There is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in a@@ m@@ n@@ i@@ o@@ tic flu@@ id in the womb ; it is easier to get used to water after that .
In principle , it is logical , because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bath@@ ing .
" This is very little time to forget something , " says infant swimming i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ ctor Marina Ak@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ ova .
In other words , if for a newborn weightlessness is more natural , a woman needs gravity , earth 's pull .
S@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ ach and p@@ e@@ l@@ vic muscles usually quickly d@@ e@@ generate in weightlessness ; the ability to push out the embry@@ o is reduced .
Well , let 's assume that childbirth stimul@@ ators will work out .
Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room .
" Then what ? " - asks Val@@ ery Poli@@ a@@ k@@ ov about this non-@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ al issue .
On the other hand , a baby also needs artificial gravity .
When a body does not feel the earth 's pull , it does not form the s@@ k@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ t@@ al and muscular system .
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training , as they do with adults .
He will simply not have what he needs to survive .
" And this exper@@ iment , that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment , will lead to us bringing a handic@@ apped , completely u@@ n@@ adapted human to earth , " predic@@ ts Chairman of the Committee on Bio@@ eth@@ ics IMB@@ P R@@ AN Igor P@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ v .
For the moment , birth of children in space is just a theory .
However , with time , it will become reality , when e@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ lings will go to a far@@ away planet in their ships , and it will become the home for their offspring , who were born in space .
N@@ K@@ U Head : S@@ v@@ a@@ r@@ c System audit has failed because of politicians .
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application .
This was said by M@@ i@@ l@@ os@@ l@@ a@@ v Kala , vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office ( N@@ K@@ U ) in an interview for Ak@@ t@@ u@@ a@@ l@@ n@@ e@@ .@@ c@@ z .
" The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , " states Kala , c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ enting on the current situation .
Simil@@ ar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors .
As an example of improper practice , they cite Pet@@ r N@@ e@@ c@@ as 's approach to the so-called " S@@ v@@ a@@ r@@ c System . "
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the O@@ D@@ S will not be b@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ ening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed ?
" The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohi@@ bits something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ u@@ ty-@@ bound to monitor and enforce , " asser@@ ts Kala .
At the audit committee 's session in the House of D@@ e@@ p@@ u@@ ties , you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany , within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared .
What exactly was this about ?
This is about parallel a@@ u@@ dit@@ ing , which we began around two years ago .
Sim@@ ply put , this is about how European legislation g@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ s the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state l@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ l@@ ations and then the actual practice itself .
We brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms , our legislation might be even " more conc@@ ise and complete , " however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany .
This confir@@ ms that creating more and more conc@@ ise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
What does this project actually help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
This kind of joint audit could contribute to c@@ u@@ r@@ tail@@ ing these efforts to specify our law , to reduce and perfect boundaries , when it does not have such a positive impact .
Econom@@ y means acqu@@ iring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profit@@ eering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided .
However , just because we have reduced the order limits , does not mean something will be procu@@ red .
The system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork , and those , who wish to look for l@@ o@@ o@@ p@@ holes in it , will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher .
These are domestic problems about the practical implement@@ ation of legislation relating to public contracts .
How does the audit system work in Germany ?
Is there an office like the N@@ K@@ U , or is it organised d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ently ?
As far as the office is concerned , the Bun@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ r@@ e@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ u@@ n@@ g@@ s@@ h@@ of functions like our N@@ K@@ U , and it is organised like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ently , but basically both offices operate similarly .
Pow@@ ers are also similar to a degree , though of course Germany is organised f@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ally , so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ ers from our own .
The BR@@ H can only audit federal money , known to us as state funds .
Public funds , which , for us , are adminis@@ tered by regional and municipal authorities , are audited by the federal courts of auditors there .
When it comes to their legislation , is it more strai@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ forward than ours ?
Overall , I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless in certain respects Germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect .
Is this because , perhaps , they have better enforcement ?
That is certainly not true , but again , I prefer not to make such compar@@ i@@ s@@ ons .
It should be said that even in a country we p@@ e@@ r@@ ce@@ ive as exempl@@ ary , they encounter a whole range of problems .
If that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our office , would they ?
C@@ o@@ m@@ ing back to domestic legislation , what did the amend@@ ment to public contracts legislation mean for your office , is its impact being felt already ?
The period since the amend@@ ment came into force has been quite short , so it has not m@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ ested itself in our audit work yet .
Since we carry out our a@@ u@@ dits ex-@@ post , a certain delay has to be taken into account .
As yet , we have only observed it within the process of preparing future a@@ u@@ dits - we have launched our new " fiscal failure risk d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ction " system , with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts , and these have been analy@@ sed - that is where changes will clearly be seen , because of the changed limits , the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes , and so on .
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction , and I hope this will be confirmed .
A problem , which may arise here , is that the law becomes " too constrained " and will not be e@@ n@@ forc@@ eable .
Under the previous rules , parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that every infr@@ ingement of public contracts law means a breach of b@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ e@@ t@@ ary discipline .
Is it worth constr@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ing the law in this way , in that case ?
I do not think this is the way .
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not pen@@ alise those , who make a mistake on a t@@ e@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ ality , which does not affect the final decision .
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bure@@ a@@ u@@ c@@ r@@ acy .
So how can we get out of this ?
Let 's see where this dead@@ -@@ end takes us .
The Prime Minister recently said the O@@ D@@ S will not be b@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ ening businessmen with a@@ u@@ dits of the so-called " S@@ v@@ a@@ r@@ c System " - what does this mean ?
Is the S@@ v@@ a@@ r@@ c System prohi@@ bited or allowed ?
The Law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohi@@ bits something , then even the Government 's head cannot prevent the work of its department , which is d@@ u@@ ty-@@ bound to monitor and enforce .
He may say : " Let us change this law and rela@@ x it , " but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there .
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ alities which must be adh@@ ered to - which is the right way to ensure public tend@@ ers are protected .
On the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bidder with the best offer is excluded on a t@@ e@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ ality .
The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
R@@ o@@ ads are icy in places , but mostly p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ able .
In several places in the Czech Republic , the main roads are icy and snow@@ y .
However , the majority of roads are p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ able , with extra care needed in places .
Carl@@ s@@ bad region
In the Carl@@ s@@ bad region , the roads have been usable this morning , though in some places they were icy and snow@@ y .
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero , though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day .
S@@ n@@ o@@ wing in the region has stopped , and only a thin layer of snow remains in the l@@ o@@ w@@ lands .
However , the ridges of the K@@ rus@@ ne Mountains have around 30 c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ metres of snow .
In some locations there is limited visibility due to m@@ i@@ s@@ t , according to the local highway service .
The R@@ 6 high-@@ speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now usable without restric@@ tion .
Cau@@ tion is , of course , appropriate , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be icy and sli@@ pper@@ y .
All secondary and t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ary roads are also p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ able , including mountain roads .
In certain stretches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ acted snow patches .
Above all , at higher levels , extra care should be taken while driving .
P@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ u@@ b@@ ice and H@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ e@@ c Kr@@ a@@ l@@ o@@ ve region
On some roads in Eastern B@@ o@@ hem@@ ia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher a@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ des and in the mountains there might be a layer of c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ acted snow , according to the Road and Mot@@ o@@ r@@ way Direct@@ orate .
The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which might occur at higher a@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ des of the P@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ u@@ b@@ ice region in particular .
Black ice may occur around L@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ k@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ n , U@@ sti n@@ ad O@@ r@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ i , Polic@@ ky , S@@ vit@@ a@@ v@@ y , and V@@ y@@ s@@ o@@ ke My@@ to , and particularly on secondary and t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ary roads .
The I / 43 and I / 34 roads have been chem@@ ically treated around S@@ vit@@ a@@ v@@ y .
Snow is particularly affecting the roads in the Kr@@ kon@@ o@@ se and O@@ r@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ke mountains .
At higher a@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ des , there is a c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ acted snow layer on the roads around Ry@@ c@@ h@@ n@@ o@@ v n@@ ad Kne@@ z@@ n@@ o@@ u and Tru@@ t@@ n@@ o@@ v .
In Eastern B@@ o@@ hem@@ ia the day will be mostly clear to partly clou@@ dy , and dry .
Tem@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ atures will be between minus three and plus one degree Celsius mostly , with a light wind .
Pil@@ sen region
The roads in the Pil@@ sen region have been usable this morning , with extra care needed in some places . Drivers should take the weather conditions into account .
The morning will be f@@ r@@ o@@ sty , with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero .
Due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature , certain roads may be icy .
Drivers should expect m@@ i@@ s@@ t in places , though visibility will gradually improve .
This information was reported by the region 's highway service .
The D@@ 5 motorway is d@@ r@@ i@@ v@@ able almost without restric@@ tion , but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80@@ th and 13@@ 1st kilometre marks .
Most primary road surfaces are dry and f@@ r@@ o@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ free .
Southern areas of the Pil@@ sen and T@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ ov regions may have icy patches .
S@@ e@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ d@@ ary and t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ary roads are wet , and may therefore also have icy patches .
Drivers should be cautious especially on less frequ@@ ented roads in the B@@ o@@ hem@@ ian Forest .
Ol@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ c region
Drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Ol@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ c region .
It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cer@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ o@@ hor@@ k@@ se sed@@ l@@ o and on the way to Vid@@ e@@ l@@ sky K@@ r@@ i@@ z .
S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ u@@ ghs were brought out by falling snow overnight , the Sum@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ k region , according to highway maintenance , got around three c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ metres of snow .
In other parts of the region , roads are mainly p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ able without restrictions .
" In the Sum@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ k region , traces of snow have remained at the highest a@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ des .
Drivers should expect snow sl@@ ush at Cer@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ o@@ h@@ ors@@ ke sed@@ l@@ o in the direction of J@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ ik , " the dispatch officer for the Sum@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ k highway service told CT@@ K today .
Their J@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ ik counterparts also made an outing overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest a@@ l@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ des are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment , according to them .
The Ol@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ c region 's roads are usable without restric@@ tion , while in the area of S@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ k drivers should b@@ e@@ w@@ are in w@@ o@@ o@@ ded areas , where roads have remained wet .
U@@ sti n@@ ad Lab@@ em region , Liber@@ ec region
Since this morning , the snow@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ u@@ ghs have reported several places , which are difficult to pass in northern B@@ o@@ hem@@ ia .
Besides certain snow@@ -@@ covered places , or some icy frost patches , the mountain road from Tel@@ nice to K@@ n@@ i@@ n@@ ice in the U@@ sti n@@ ad Lab@@ em region is also closed , according to the police database .
Tem@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ atures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snow@@ y and icy . In the l@@ o@@ w@@ lands , however , particularly southeast of the Central B@@ o@@ hem@@ ian U@@ p@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ s , there are no problems and roads are mostly dry .
No traffic h@@ o@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ u@@ ps have so far been reported .
I@@ cy frost patches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around S@@ t@@ e@@ t@@ i .
According to m@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ o@@ r@@ ologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day , with a clear night and free@@ zing temperatures .
A@@ d@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ se conditions are expected on the main sections of the I / 13 road between the U@@ sti n@@ ad Lab@@ em and Liber@@ ec regions .
The closure of the Tel@@ nice to K@@ n@@ i@@ n@@ ice road was caused by bent tree branches , which were weighed down to road level by snow@@ fall .
Simon Orn@@ est : At the concerts we want a f@@ u@@ sion of positive energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month ?
It is just another s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ ler , which we like to lat@@ ch on to .
Together with The Tap Tap band , we tend to joke about it , saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely .
In December you are even o@@ r@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ ing a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world .
Can you give our readers some details on this ?
This is a nationwide f@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ -@@ raising event , which we have been planning for the past two years .
We decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the May@@ an calendar , due on the 21st of December at 11 : 10 a.m .
On the eve , the 20th of December , at 9pm , 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague , B@@ r@@ no , and O@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ava .
They will end at around the time when Ki@@ r@@ i@@ bat@@ i Island in the Pacific , which is 12 hours ahead of us , reaches the end of the May@@ an calendar .
Who came up with this idea ?
Initi@@ ally it was probably my idea , later we worked all the details out with our designer , H@@ o@@ n@@ z@@ a A@@ u@@ g@@ u@@ sta .
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
On the occasion of the end of the May@@ an calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , shoes , t-shirts , bags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ e@@ -@@ tap@@ .@@ c@@ z to support our cause .
The Tap Tap band , together with other artists , also recorded the so-called a@@ n@@ them against the end of the world , called " The End of the World is canc@@ elled . "
It is already well received on YouTube , will it figure at the f@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ -@@ raising concerts ?
Of course , for the grand finale , as long as the world does not end beforehand .
It will be sung by all the artists at all the three concerts at the same time .
The a@@ n@@ them will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television .
The words were written and the role of J@@ e@@ s@@ us in the video clip was played by Tomas Han@@ ak , X@@ i@@ n@@ d@@ l X also s@@ ings in it ...
How did you end up working with them ?
We collaborate also with other person@@ alities of the Czech cultural scene , due to o@@ r@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ ing a lot of f@@ u@@ n@@ d@@ -@@ raising events and concerts ...
We try to really get them involved in these projects .
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us .
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to ?
E@@ q@@ u@@ i@@ pping the wheel@@ c@@ h@@ air-@@ accessible educational Stu@@ deo centre , which is already in its sixth year , in collaboration with the citizens association Tap from the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ka Institute for the d@@ i@@ s@@ a@@ b@@ led .
Tut@@ ors come in regularly to spend time with the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ka Institute 's students and run activities , which they enjoy and interest them .
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors , so we try to provide this for them in this way .
Within the construction project at the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ka Institute , a separate building is planned , which we can move into with this project .
Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists .
How do you select them ?
We have tried to compile a programme , which speaks for all ages , including children .
For example , in Prague , Chin@@ a@@ s@@ ki , Sup@@ port Les@@ b@@ i@@ ens , Ill@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ a@@ t@@ o@@ sphere with Dan B@@ a@@ r@@ ta , The Tap Tap , M@@ a@@ r@@ ian Bang@@ o and J@@ iri S@@ u@@ chy will appear .
Further details can be found at w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ k@@ p@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ c@@ z .
Are you planning any more " bom@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ tic events " in the future ?
In May , we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring , so we will definitely be preparing a good line-up with some interesting guests .
Next year , we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York , and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago .
Your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in Madrid , Brussels , London , and Moscow .
The Tap Tap is nonetheless a band composed of handic@@ apped people .
How do you cope with these journeys in terms of logis@@ tics and organisation ?
It is not as scary as it might seem at first .
We have five members in electric wheelchairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and i@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ u@@ ment cases ...
Nevertheless , we have so far managed it without any problems , C@@ SA and British Airways were well prepared for us , so much so that , on occasion , I was quite surprised .
Even in Moscow , which we have just returned from , it all went smooth@@ ly .
Thanks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to compare specific accessi@@ bility issues , public attitudes to disability and so on .
What have been your experiences so far ?
After Madrid , Lux@@ embourg , London and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its b@@ e@@ g@@ innings .
C@@ o@@ m@@ pared to Prague , Moscow is rather i@@ n@@ accessible ; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own .
Ob@@ v@@ i@@ ous things , such as giving wheelchairs priority in lif@@ ts , are not c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ place there .
Fort@@ u@@ n@@ ately , citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
And on the other hand , where do we still l@@ a@@ g behind more advanced countries ?
There are a lot of things , which we still l@@ a@@ g behind on ...
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always dep@@ end on the efforts of the people who are affected .
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handic@@ aps to be independ@@ ently out in public , and they can use the toilets , go to the museum , or wherever ...
It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life , in this respect with The Tap Tap we are a step ahead !
Public respect or accessi@@ bility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athletes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
So far there are only excep@@ tional cases , people who are strong-willed .
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular , but let us look back a few years , what prompted you in 1998 to form it ?
I began my job as a tutor at the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ka Institute , where I was surrounded by a lot of young people , who were interested in doing something .
Since I am a musician myself - among others I play the sax@@ o@@ p@@ h@@ one - I started a music club with a colleague .
With time , as our moder@@ ator Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovic says , it has grown a little out of our control ( laugh ) .
Your popularity has only come about in the last few years , or am I mistak@@ en ?
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band .
We r@@ e@@ alised that work , which goes on u@@ n@@ seen can be like it never existed .
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tutors , equipment and so on .
Was it your goal to take The Tap Tap to such heights ?
From the o@@ u@@ t@@ set , I felt there was potential to do things a little d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ently .
Show business is filled with things , where one i@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ ates the other .
It is logical in its own way ; all new things are taken in hes@@ i@@ t@@ antly and take a long time .
Things , which are unique , are few and far between , but I would d@@ are to claim that Tap Tap is one of those things .
A person 's first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a natural reaction ...
But that pity is simply was@@ ted , because handic@@ apped people are not abandoned and suffering beings , who need to be p@@ i@@ tied .
They are people , who can fully live life and blo@@ s@@ s@@ o@@ m , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something , it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole .
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader , as many people are suggesting ?
If we want to achieve top class work , we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline .
I think this is to be expected .
Some people come to us with a rom@@ antic idea and their head in the clouds , and when they find out they have to go to r@@ e@@ hear@@ s@@ als twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts , their enthusiasm quickly disappears .
That is how it works everywhere , with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .
The Tap Tap band currently has twenty members .
How many of those were present at the beginning in 1998 ?
Only one , Lad@@ ya Angel@@ ovic .
We are an open group , people come and people go , this is u@@ n@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ i@@ d@@ able .
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open .
The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected , on Thursday 20.@@ 12.@@ 2012 from 9pm .
The venues will be Pra@@ ha I@@ n@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ ba , B@@ r@@ no F@@ l@@ e@@ da , and O@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ ava P@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ o@@ j@@ e@@ m with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic .
All three cities will be joined by a televised l@@ i@@ n@@ k@@ -up at the evening 's close for a united rendition of The Tap Tap 's a@@ n@@ them " The End of the World is canc@@ elled "
The concert 's goal is to raise funds to equip the ST@@ U@@ DE@@ O multi-@@ functional wheel@@ -@@ chair accessible learning centre at the J@@ e@@ d@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ka Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech c@@ r@@ o@@ w@@ ns .
Admission fee to the concert is 400 C@@ Z@@ K , children under 12 years of age go free , tickets on sale from B@@ o@@ hem@@ i@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ ket .
Poland and the C@@ o@@ smo@@ s .
Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the t@@ w@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ eth member of the agency , being the second nation from the former Eastern Block ( after the Czech Republic , which became a fully fle@@ dged member of the E@@ S@@ A on the 12th of November 2008 ) .
Poland began close cooperation with the E@@ S@@ A in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects .
Of course , Poland 's path to the space had begun much earlier .
Polish b@@ o@@ f@@ f@@ ins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War , but were not always met with understanding .
I look back , for instance , to the lecture of A S@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ f@@ eld in Warsaw 's astron@@ omy observ@@ atory , who , on the 6th of December 1@@ 9@@ 33 , presented ideas on his pione@@ ering work E@@ n@@ try into space .
The thoughts of the young engineer ( born 1@@ 9@@ 05 ) left his audience cold , and years later S@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ f@@ eld remembered that only Dr. J@@ an Gad@@ omski had shown an interest in his work .
In 1934 , for his work E@@ n@@ try into space , S@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ f@@ eld received the Robert E@@ sn@@ a@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ -@@ Pel@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ie and Andre Louis Hir@@ sch prize in France .
The above mentioned Dr. J@@ an Gad@@ omski ( 1@@ 8@@ 99 - 1966 ) later became a strong promo@@ ter of astron@@ omy and astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics .
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects .
Gad@@ omski became a world-@@ known promo@@ ter of astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics and his contribution was , notably , recogn@@ ised when a crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him .
In 1925 , Poland had already built a h@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ car which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine .
Unfortunately , both the project 's designer , and the project 's details , are unknown .
It is not even clear , whether the rocket was intended to start the h@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ car or to slow it down .
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time .
In 1@@ 9@@ 33 the Polish artillery started their engagement in flying bombs .
The research was undertaken by the W@@ e@@ a@@ p@@ ons Technology Division in collaboration with P@@ r@@ o@@ f@@ . M@@ i@@ e@@ c@@ z@@ y@@ s@@ law Wolf@@ ke and P@@ r@@ o@@ f@@ . G@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ aw M@@ o@@ k@@ r@@ z@@ y@@ c@@ k@@ i .
From the documents , it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests .
Of course , the advance of the German army interrup@@ ted the research .
In 1937 , the concept of a photo@@ electric h@@ o@@ m@@ ing rocket designed by engineer R@@ o@@ h@@ o@@ zin@@ ski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year The Roc@@ ket - air tor@@ p@@ e@@ do and flying rocket-@@ bomb appeared , authored by L@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ w@@ y@@ -@@ K@@ r@@ y@@ wob@@ l@@ o@@ c@@ ki .
Both projects were d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ined for military use of rocket engines .
Im@@ medi@@ ately prior to the War , all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the P@@ r@@ o@@ visi@@ onal Scienti@@ fic Advis@@ ory Board ( T@@ y@@ m@@ c@@ z@@ a@@ s@@ o@@ w@@ y K@@ o@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ et Dor@@ a@@ d@@ c@@ z@@ o@@ -@@ N@@ a@@ u@@ k@@ o@@ w@@ y ) that coordinated all the work .
The Board was appointed in 1937 , but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War .
Further work devoted to astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish Astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics Company ( Pol@@ s@@ k@@ ie T@@ o@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ z@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ w@@ o Astron@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ y@@ c@@ z@@ ne ) .
The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine P@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ l@@ e@@ m@@ s in 1954 , in which four in-@@ depth articles are on the subject of astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics .
In one of these , by P@@ r@@ o@@ f@@ . S@@ u@@ b@@ o@@ tow@@ i@@ c@@ z , the establishment of a company is proposed , which would dedic@@ ate itself to astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics .
At the time , there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that cosmic research was an emerging sector .
From the beginning of 1@@ 9@@ 56 , the Polish Astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics Company ( PT@@ A ) sought entry to the International Astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics Federation ( est . 1951 ) and by autumn the PT@@ A was already a full member .
In the following year , the PT@@ A 's first chairman , Kaz@@ i@@ m@@ i@@ e@@ r@@ z Zar@@ ank@@ i@@ e@@ w@@ i@@ c@@ z ( 1@@ 9@@ 02 - 1959 ) was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International Astron@@ a@@ u@@ tics Federation .
He served in this capacity until his death in 1959 .
From 1@@ 9@@ 56 , the PT@@ A played a significant role in the successful development of meteorological roc@@ kets R@@ M ( R@@ a@@ k@@ i@@ eta Met@@ e@@ o@@ r@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ i@@ c@@ z@@ na ) , which became the first Polish rocket to enable scientific research .
The first R@@ M-@@ 1 model was completed in 1@@ 9@@ 57 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958 .
The rocket , with a ceiling of 1800 metres , measured around 80 cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg .
Later , the improved R@@ M-@@ 1@@ A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initi@@ ated for the two-@@ stage R@@ M-@@ 2 rocket in the Ble@@ d@@ o@@ w@@ sky Des@@ ert .
The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.@@ 5 kg .
A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the R@@ M-@@ 34 rocket was to reach 14.@@ 5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds .
Of course , in 1962 further research was stopped .
The successor to the R@@ M rocket type was the Met@@ e@@ or-@@ 1 rocket , developed from 1962 to 1965 .
The rocket was designed as a two-@@ stage rocket , with a total length of 5@@ 10 cm and a launch weight of 32.@@ 5 kg .
Three models were developed ( designated Met@@ e@@ or-@@ 1@@ A , -@@ 1@@ B , and -@@ 1@@ C ) , which d@@ i@@ f@@ f@@ ered in the room available for scientific apparatus .
In the Met@@ e@@ or-@@ 1@@ A rocket , a space of 0.4 litres was available , Met@@ e@@ or-@@ 1@@ B had 0.34 litres , and Met@@ e@@ or-@@ 1@@ C had 0@@ .@@ 62 litres .
The maximum altitude for all three models was 37@@ km .
Between 1965 and 1968 , the development of Met@@ e@@ or-@@ 2 was underway in the Aeronautics Institute , with its first launch tests in October 1970 .
The Met@@ e@@ or-@@ 2 rocket had a launch weight of 3@@ 80 kg , and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60@@ km .
Sub@@ s@@ e@@ q@@ u@@ ently built models were the Met@@ e@@ or-@@ 2@@ H and Met@@ e@@ or-@@ 3 .
Poland 's admission to CO@@ S@@ P@@ A@@ R ( Committee for Space Research ) in 1@@ 9@@ 60 should be mentioned , as well as the appointment of a national CO@@ S@@ P@@ A@@ R board two years later .
Poland also participated in the I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ k@@ o@@ smo@@ s space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites , and in 1@@ 9@@ 78 , the Polish pilot M@@ i@@ r@@ o@@ s@@ law Her@@ mas@@ zew@@ ski became the second i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ cos@@ m@@ o@@ n@@ aut after Vladimir Rem@@ k@@ o@@ v .
A@@ b@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ shing the legislation on public works is not the solution .
Last week the C@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ tional Court aboli@@ shed the law on public works .
The resolution caused liv@@ ely public debate .
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective .
Liber@@ ally oriented financial systems in the EU , just as those in the glob@@ alised world , are based on the principle of an u@@ n@@ regulated economic competition .
Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves .
The cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely u@@ n@@ regulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation .
Due to significant lab@@ our cost differences ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices .
On this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by i@@ m@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ ting cheap goods , " the rug is pulled " from under the competition 's prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way , increase its own profits .
On a wider scale , this means most businesses must move production abroad , import cheaply from abroad , or close down . The result is high unemployment in countries where lab@@ our costs are high compared to other economies .
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase .
The whole situation is bol@@ stered by the business@@ man 's complete u@@ n@@ willingness to pay taxes , which would allevi@@ ate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statisti@@ cal data .
The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ f@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ ally lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment .
In other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while d@@ i@@ s@@ regarding the drop in social standards .
This occurs chie@@ fly in amend@@ ments to existing law .
The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dict@@ ated by private capital , especially in terms of salaries .
On one hand , this economic system of force , in case of long-term unemployment , on the other , restric@@ ted employee rights in the workplace .
This yi@@ elds growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich .
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-@@ out c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ es for the poor , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
The number of these people is already in the millions .
In the name of impro@@ ving the competi@@ tiveness of the German economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of a@@ u@@ x@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ary staff in the Bun@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ag .
The a@@ u@@ ster@@ ity measures for all the southern EU states will u@@ n@@ doub@@ tedly lead to the same situation , where people are pressured by a catastrop@@ hic drop in living standards to emigr@@ ate as it was in the 19th century , or to eke out an existence on starvation wages on the edge of society , in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment .
At this point we have to ask where this may come from ?
If it is to come from other EU states , then poverty is being shifted from one country to another , or it will not come at all , because Chinese , Indian , Braz@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ an , Turkish , Mor@@ occan , Egyptian , and African lab@@ our is still at a fraction of European wages .
This applies to all of Latin America .
Liberal theory and the Media inc@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ antly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a controlled economy leads to economic r@@ u@@ in .
Private capital cru@@ elly insists on the vie@@ w@@ point that the State must not interven@@ e in the economy .
Ther@@ e@@ u@@ p@@ on , we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence , or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country , for its own selfish ends .
Here , the answer must be yes .
The proof is the existence of the almost o@@ m@@ n@@ i@@ potent , and in all states , o@@ m@@ n@@ i@@ present lobby .
The result is a desperate situation m@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ f@@ esting itself through corruption , through mutual benefits and legislation , where almost everything is criminal , but nothing is pun@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ able .
In Germany the situation is such that state m@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ tries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the dra@@ f@@ ting of laws to private law firms , who are basically connected with industry .
These laws are then approved in the Bun@@ d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ag .
Real power does not come from the people as the Wester@@ n-@@ style constitu@@ tions claim , but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests .
It is clear that liber@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ y@@ -@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ated democrac@@ ies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by Ap@@ p@@ i@@ an in his work on the Roman Republic Cris@@ is in the time of Cesar and Pom@@ p@@ e@@ i : " The State was already long in complete d@@ e@@ generation and its offices taken by force .
With b@@ r@@ i@@ bery , illegal acquisition of benefits , and with stones or swords .
B@@ r@@ i@@ bery and corruption were r@@ i@@ fe and u@@ n@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ dered , and the people would vote for a result which had been bought " ... " people with principles did not run for office , so on one occasion the whole d@@ e@@ b@@ a@@ c@@ le meant the state went eight months without consul@@ s .. " .. " There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being auto@@ c@@ r@@ acy , and an e@@ n@@ e@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ tic man should be elected . " Ap@@ p@@ i@@ an had Pom@@ p@@ e@@ i in mind , but it was Cesar who changed democracy for auto@@ c@@ r@@ acy perman@@ ently .
The conclusion , just as in a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ quity , the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole .
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
The outcome is now , as it was then , an unprecedented decad@@ ence of the elite with no attempts w@@ h@@ a@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever on deeper reaching reforms .
The c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ ality of the rise of the fas@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ t and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liber@@ alisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries .
The current state of affairs , when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liber@@ alised democracy as an i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ l@@ u@@ de , can expect its next cycle .
The particularly catastrop@@ hic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already wit@@ n@@ essing , as well as crimes against h@@ u@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ ity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
The aboli@@ tion of the law on public works is not the answer , at least not in the long term .
Under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within Europe , the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population 's living standards .
This pattern is thus s@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ emic .
To address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state 's capital participation in the economy , increase the people 's influence over the state and weak@@ en the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
Israel : C@@ h@@ a@@ os La@@ b .
" Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could , " from S@@ ting 's F@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ ile , where one of the main v@@ e@@ r@@ ses from the refrain is " L@@ est we forget how fragile we are . "
" If my sons did not want war , there would be none , " said the dying Gut@@ le S@@ c@@ h@@ napp@@ er , wife of May@@ er A@@ m@@ schel Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ d in 1@@ 8@@ 49 .
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip , as always , has spar@@ ked a lot of reaction .
Some stand by Israel , arguing it has the right to self-@@ defence , and Palestinians are portr@@ ayed as terrorists , while others support the Palestinians , claiming racism by the Israeli state , claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs , and that Israel is a terrorist state .
I do not want to dwell , in these repeated perio@@ dic waves of killing , on who is the t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ g@@ ressor and who is the victim , after all , today 's i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants of Israel , including the self-@@ governing territories , were born into the current political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence .
I would like to offer the readers a peek behind the scenes , a look at whom , most of all , this 95-@@ year long tension is serving ( starting from Bal@@ four 's declaration in November 1917 ) on this small piece of land in the Middle East .
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
Human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power .
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a N@@ a@@ p@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ on .
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independ@@ ently , or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-@@ calculated goal .
We must accept that we live in a time when the world 's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentr@@ ation of wealth and the power it exu@@ des could not happen in one generation 's lif@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ an .
Among these astron@@ o@@ m@@ ically rich families , one stands out , which could be considered the puppet master ( whether someone else stands above them , I am unsure , but I would not rule it out ) - the Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ ds .
Not much is written about them .
Under@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ ably .
The first news agency ( Reuters ) they bought in the 90 's of the 19th century , in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high crimin@@ ality , which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power , increasing wealth , or both .
They hold majority s@@ t@@ akes in almost every central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either w@@ aging or preparing for war ( before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries , after Iraq it was 5 , after the o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ throw of K@@ add@@ a@@ f@@ i 4 remained , but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government ) .
Whoever attempted to d@@ e@@ f@@ y this family died .
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ d Bank of America , and during the Civil War he began to issue his own ( that is state-@@ issued ) money and was assassin@@ ated in 1@@ 8@@ 65 at the theatre .
JF@@ K began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed ( Federal Reserve ) , and was killed in 1963 , Cong@@ ressman Louis McFadden was pois@@ oned in 1936 , after he had intended to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1@@ 9@@ 29 .
Their thir@@ st for global power led in the years of 1@@ 8@@ 59 - 1@@ 8@@ 71 to the f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ ulation of a three-@@ world-@@ war plan by the f@@ r@@ e@@ e@@ m@@ a@@ s@@ on leader of the 33@@ rd degree , Albert Pike .
The first war was to remove the large m@@ o@@ n@@ arch@@ ic state bodies in Europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from Great Britain , and the third will reduce the world 's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of sl@@ aves will s@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ ice for their comfort and luxury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( e@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ ism is just an a@@ p@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ er for this solution ) , and finally the s@@ e@@ izing of absolute power .
The method , which the group of wealthy families with the Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ ds leading the way , employ is the i@@ n@@ stig@@ ation of c@@ r@@ ises , followed by the offering of a solution ( order ab chao - order from c@@ h@@ a@@ os ) .
These solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( v@@ i@@ de establishment of the Fed , so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated ) .
Thus , having succeeded in assassin@@ ating Fer@@ din@@ and , the H@@ abs@@ burg heir to the A@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ -@@ Hun@@ garian throne , in Saraj@@ evo thereby unle@@ ashing World War I , they destroyed ts@@ arist Russia with the Bol@@ s@@ h@@ e@@ v@@ i@@ k revolution .
The First World War ended abrup@@ tly , militarily and economically u@@ n@@ substanti@@ ated , with German capit@@ ulation ( the war was no longer needed to destroy ts@@ arist Russia ) and the central European powers of Austri@@ a@@ -@@ Hun@@ gary were subsequently dismantled .
To facili@@ tate the inception of the Second World War , they allowed bankers and politicians to create a lat@@ ent conflict situation by sadd@@ ling Germany with huge war r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ ations , thereby making a rad@@ i@@ c@@ alist example of the impoverished m@@ asses , it remained only to introdu@@ ce a sufficiently c@@ o@@ n@@ v@@ inc@@ ing c@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ r@@ it and a leader with a simple solution , while also creating a multi-@@ racial C@@ ze@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ slo@@ v@@ a@@ k@@ ia with a strong German minority to play , and indeed did , the role of a fifth colony , once the war had been ignited .
At the end of the 19th Century , the Roth@@ s@@ c@@ h@@ i@@ l@@ ds i@@ n@@ stig@@ ated the establishment of the Zi@@ onist movement , one branch of which stro@@ ve to form the Jewish State , seeking out an area of historic J@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ a , Jerusalem , to make its capital ( the Return to Z@@ i@@ on ) .
The a@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ oned Bal@@ four Declar@@ ation formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population .
Terr@@ orist attacks occurred on both sides .
World War II broke out , and whether Hit@@ ler broke free from the l@@ e@@ ash , which international bankers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , n@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ eless the suffering of European Jews in the concentr@@ ation camps created the foundation to the world 's accep@@ t@@ ance of the Jewish State .
Israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war r@@ e@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ ations for World War II were l@@ ayed on Germany , the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war 's hot@@ bed .
P@@ r@@ o@@ v@@ i@@ ded the international bankers succeed , the Jewish Nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the Arabic - or more generally , Muslim - population of the Middle East .
Israel is like a huge laboratory , a source of d@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ ord and c@@ h@@ a@@ os not only within the country , but on an international level ( just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel ) .
Who is the wrong@@ -@@ d@@ o@@ er and who is the victim in the P@@ a@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ine-@@ Israel conflict , where injustice b@@ r@@ e@@ e@@ d@@ s injustice in an e@@ n@@ d@@ less cycle of violence , while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power ?
Here , we must differenti@@ ate between Israel 's general population and their leaders , because , just as it happens here , the international bankers introdu@@ ce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
Israel 's current prime minister , Net@@ a@@ n@@ y@@ a@@ h@@ u ' the hawk ' , is a typical example of a fas@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ t politician , loyal to the international bankers , who does everything to i@@ n@@ stig@@ ate war with Iran , which would , due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( China , India , Russia , Pakistan , ... ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the Hor@@ m@@ u@@ z Strait , where 20 % of the world 's oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world 's economy .
In what light stand the words , spoken by David Roc@@ k@@ e@@ f@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ er in 1994 : " All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . "
The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and sl@@ ave .
A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial aristo@@ c@@ r@@ ats .
A world , where each new@@ -@@ born is implan@@ ted with a chip , which makes their existence completely s@@ u@@ b@@ j@@ u@@ g@@ ated .
" He also forced everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and sl@@ ave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his fore@@ head , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the b@@ e@@ ast or the number of his name .
If anyone has insight , let him calculate the number of the b@@ e@@ ast ,
for it is man 's number . His number is six hundred and six@@ ty six . "
A@@ r@@ go : When things are at their worst - call Hollywood .
In November 1979 , a mob of Islamic student demonstr@@ ators took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage .
They were to be released in exchange for the o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ thrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahl@@ avi , who fled after the revolution to the USA , which had actually supported his regime for several decades .
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ board , because this would seriously j@@ e@@ o@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ e the trust of other allied countries .
The release of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the t@@ h@@ e@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ atic regime , could not be achieved .
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States , which was later compounded by the fiasco of attempting to free the hostages by force .
The i@@ n@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ c@@ e@@ r@@ ated diplomats were finally released after 444 days , following negotiations medi@@ ated by the Alg@@ eri@@ an government .
Their ordeal provoked a wave of soli@@ dar@@ ity and anti-@@ Iranian feelings at home .
The d@@ e@@ b@@ a@@ c@@ le in Iran significantly influenced Jimmy Carter 's loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections .
The film A@@ r@@ go , directed by the actor Ben Aff@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ k , r@@ e@@ c@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ ts one episode in this story , which brought America a small victory .
Just before the embassy was seized , six employees escaped .
After some p@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ia , they ended up in the Canadian ambassador 's residence .
The CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , succeeded in getting them out of Iran , helped by an extravagant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew , who were s@@ u@@ r@@ v@@ e@@ ying locations for a sci@@ -fi blockbuster .
A combination of g@@ e@@ n@@ res
The plan , conceived by " e@@ x@@ f@@ i@@ l@@ t@@ r@@ ation " expert , Tony Men@@ dez , required the assistance of Hollywood .
For the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were organised , and the f@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ ous production company had a real office .
The details of the operation were , for a long time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of Tony Men@@ dez .
Aff@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ k 's film is a pecu@@ liar mix of g@@ e@@ n@@ res .
On one hand , there is a r@@ e@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ stic incis@@ ive political thriller , and at the same time a " c@@ a@@ p@@ er movie , " with small victories and double-@@ crossing - another example would be Ocean 's Eleven .
The mood altern@@ ates in the film - on one side , sharp d@@ o@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ary-@@ style sequences in Tehran ( the title sequence shows iconic photos from news of the time , relating to the same events portr@@ ayed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
On the other hand , ligh@@ ter sections from Hollywood , lac@@ ed with irony and a little exagger@@ ation .
Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables , in office corridors , over the phone ...
Ben Aff@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ k has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style .
The d@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ ed actor has become a respected director , and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments .
A@@ r@@ go is his third big-@@ screen movie , following his dark crime movie G@@ one Baby G@@ one ( 2007 ) and the thriller The Town ( 2010 ) .
It is also Aff@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ k 's first picture , which does not take place in the director 's hometown of Boston .
The atmospheric feel in different locations is one of the character@@ istics , which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards .
Aff@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ k shows it in A@@ r@@ go , where Tehran is " featured " by Canada .
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impres@@ sively luci@@ d , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come flooding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
A similar effect is achieved by Aff@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ k and his team in the f@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ ous scenes ( the f@@ ake staff at the Tehran b@@ a@@ z@@ a@@ ar ) .
Too much action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many n@@ a@@ i@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ iting scenes for the film .
What little there is , is worked well , with some o@@ c@@ c@@ a@@ s@@ i@@ onal e@@ m@@ b@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ments to reality - these do not all come off so eleg@@ antly ( the scene , where a l@@ o@@ o@@ m@@ ing crisis is averted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America , followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far-@@ fetched ) .
A@@ r@@ go 's weakness is its diver@@ g@@ ence , which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places .
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play their roles as the Hollywood a@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ants with great charm ; their characters deserve more room , and are not by far the only ones in this film .
Aff@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ k 's film loses the dramatic pull a little , it is a film , which can be watched with reasonable interest , its production and r@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ -@@ style are e@@ voc@@ ative of thr@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ers from the 70 's .
It does not really captiv@@ ate .
As a reminder of history 's particular ways and a testimony to how exagger@@ ated the views are on the all-@@ powerful all-@@ controlling secret services , this will do .
Rules for blowing up ballo@@ ons , for bananas and a c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ us
The w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ b@@ a@@ n@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ n@@ i@@ p@@ o@@ plat@@ ky@@ .com server , which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge , has now decided to announce a competition for " the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU . "
" We were prompted by the latest story , where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe 's largest companies , " Patri@@ k N@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ er , the poll 's o@@ r@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ er , told P@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ o .
Among the latest nominated a@@ b@@ s@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ i@@ ties , for instance , is the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women .
Until now , women were favoured in life insurance prices , because they constitu@@ te a lower risk for insurers .
" Other unbelievable ideas from the EU can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year .
The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2@@ 0@@ 13 , " informed N@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ er .
Among the controversial EU regulations , we might include the mandatory addition of b@@ i@@ o@@ -@@ ingredients to fuel , which consequently h@@ a@@ r@@ ms the environment , the ban on reliable m@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ u@@ r@@ y t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ m@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ ers just because they contain a relatively small quanti@@ ty of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chicken c@@ ages , which significantly raised egg prices this year .
The ban on the use of the term " s@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ able butter " and the withdrawal of classic light bul@@ bs from sale had previously come under criticism .
First rate bananas are to measure 14 c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ metres
The Union 's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group , whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states ' interests ( just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vetoed ) .
The lobby 's interests were , for example , that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU , and were not to display and " anom@@ alous curvature . "
The European Commission defended itself , saying that it was only harmon@@ ising existing d@@ i@@ s@@ join@@ ted national standards , which complicated trading .
N@@ o@@ r@@ ms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been sof@@ tened by the EU despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives .
One possible p@@ r@@ i@@ ze-@@ winner in the poll may be the last year 's EU regulation according to which infl@@ a@@ t@@ able ballo@@ ons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without parental supervision .
Here , the EU pointed to an American research , which indicated that , among other toys , ballo@@ ons are one of the main causes of child s@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ o@@ c@@ ation .
A similar restric@@ tion now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blow@@ ers .
S@@ t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ ge ideas are conceived at home too
Fair@@ ly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU , who holds an official post , may not use the term Mac@@ edonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Gre@@ ece , and instead the acron@@ ym F@@ Y@@ RO@@ M ( Former Yu@@ goslav Republic of Mac@@ edonia ) should be used .
The B@@ a@@ n@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ n@@ i@@ p@@ o@@ plat@@ ky@@ .com server in collaboration with the Liberal Econom@@ ist Association , L@@ a@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ z F@@ a@@ i@@ re , also nominated , aside from the a@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ oned a@@ b@@ s@@ u@@ r@@ d@@ i@@ ties , for example the Union 's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state .
The EU s@@ t@@ i@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ated the maximum volumes of food provisions , which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union .
The Czech Republic there@@ after exceed@@ ed , for instance , the permitted volume of m@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ room preserves , which incur@@ red a high penalty .
The poll 's organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coast@@ line , or the suggestion of a@@ l@@ locating funding for a request for funding .
These ideas did not come from Brussels , however , but from Prague .
" We are handic@@ apped because we do not have the sea .
We are asking the European Union for a r@@ e@@ fund , " declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , Jar@@ os@@ l@@ a@@ v P@@ a@@ l@@ as ( CS@@ S@@ D ) .
His argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals , and due to the so-called buy-@@ out interventions , the state 's w@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ houses were full and were forced to export .
The Czech Republic is further away from a port , so according to P@@ a@@ l@@ as the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of E@@ u@@ r@@ os .
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by o@@ r@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ ing a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea .
Fun@@ ding to s@@ u@@ b@@ s@@ i@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ e funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development 's minister , Pav@@ el N@@ e@@ m@@ ec ( US@@ -D@@ EU ) , specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels .
EU : B@@ i@@ z@@ a@@ r@@ re legislation is the exception
Reg@@ ulations may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the EU 's efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire Union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts .
A more important issue , according to experts , is the drawing of EU funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ t@@ h@@ ening the European integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting .
E@@ m@@ o@@ tions f@@ l@@ are among C@@ ze@@ c@@ h@@ s when , just as other countries in the Union , the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular lab@@ elling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
The C@@ ze@@ c@@ h@@ s fought for six years with the Germans and Austri@@ ans to protect the lab@@ elling of their Ol@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ u@@ cke t@@ v@@ a@@ r@@ u@@ zky , however the t@@ u@@ z@@ e@@ m@@ sky rum , whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be r@@ e@@ n@@ amed t@@ u@@ z@@ e@@ m@@ ak by the manufacturers .
The appell@@ ation of rum can only be given to products d@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ l@@ led from cane sugar , and not sugar b@@ e@@ et .
Carl@@ s@@ bad w@@ a@@ f@@ ers , P@@ o@@ h@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ ky and Tre@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ sky c@@ a@@ r@@ p , and Z@@ a@@ t@@ ec h@@ o@@ p@@ s have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU , alongside the world-@@ renowned fet@@ a cheese and gorg@@ o@@ n@@ z@@ ola , German m@@ a@@ r@@ zi@@ pan from L@@ u@@ b@@ e@@ ck , and Parma ham .
The EU 's stamp of protection can also be proudly shown on P@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ u@@ b@@ ice g@@ inger@@ bread and Hor@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ y tubes .
People want me to save the republic , but I am an a@@ m@@ ateur , says Ok@@ a@@ m@@ ura
Senator , how does a person decide they want to run for President ?
This is not about me being a senator or president .
If everything in our country worked without problems , then I would not be running for any post .
I cannot watch any longer the country having been rob@@ bed over the past twenty years , thiev@@ es r@@ o@@ aming about there and people 's taxes and retirement age increasing .
I had no ambition to be a politician .
When I see something I do not like , though , I try to find a solution to change things .
Since I have already turned f@@ o@@ r@@ ty , and I am an independent non-@@ party man , I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for senator or president .
You have already reached the Senate , but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle .
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this ?
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Senate 's elections .
Later , I added that if I were elected as senator , I would be standing for president .
My goal , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be r@@ e@@ alised .
Ther@@ e@@ fore , I need the greatest influence , and the strong@@ est mand@@ ate possible .
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swe@@ ar in the pub or at the television , but that we t@@ r@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ le anyone , who wants to try to change things .
The Media add to this , misleading the public , and m@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ aking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
For example , I was allegedly b@@ r@@ i@@ bing reporters , or I was allegedly an advis@@ or of J@@ iri P@@ a@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ b@@ e@@ k .
Let 's talk about your vision .
You set out on your castle siege with a thes@@ is on the material and criminal r@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ i@@ b@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ties of politics , and a retro@@ active financial disclosure of assets over twenty million .
You need to change the law for this .
As president , though , you do not have this power , and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws .
How are you going to solve this ?
When I l@@ o@@ b@@ b@@ i@@ ed , as a citiz@@ en , for tour guide work to be a free trade , it was successfully carried through .
The problem is political squ@@ a@@ b@@ bling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right , it will be deliberately rejected , causing delays for the public .
As an independent non-@@ party man , I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides .
The advantage I hold is that without the political p@@ i@@ g@@ e@@ o@@ n@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ ing or dog@@ m@@ as I can take what is best for our country from any side , and apply it .
Do you see yourself as a person from the right , or the left ?
From the Czech vie@@ w@@ point , it seems they tend to put me to the left .
For me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right .
The important part for me is moving forward .
It is not about whether someone is from the left or right , I just want to bring people together .
I always support any good public solutions , even if they are put forward by the K@@ SC@@ M or the O@@ D@@ S , and , in the same way , I will oppose bad ideas .
You get angry when someone calls you a populist .
Are you not confir@@ ming this with what you have stated ?
When you make a company business plan , you also have some ideal goal and vision .
You try to come close to it .
Some may call it p@@ o@@ p@@ u@@ lism , but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just s@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ ans .
You will not last long in politics with that .
Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
I have no alternative .
I need to convince politicians , reporters , and the public , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
If I were elected president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil servants , judges , and the Attorney General .
And , as the case may be , they would need to explain why they did not want this .
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
Take for instance the direct election of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure .
I will say frankly that I am an a@@ m@@ ateur , I am not a genius or an intellectual .
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision .
I have just started out in politics , and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda .
I will try to make things progress , but it if does not work out , in six years I will finish and return to the private sector .
It sounds a little like Ok@@ a@@ m@@ ura is trying to save the Czech Republic .
I am no sav@@ i@@ our .
I know that alone I will not achieve anything , so I have asked acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ tances , whether they would run for the s@@ e@@ n@@ ate .
I went to Radi@@ m Jan@@ c@@ u@@ r@@ a , who declined due to his workload .
So I , at least , support investig@@ ative journalist , J@@ ana Lor@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ va , who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil .
I put myself forward , because people are really discont@@ ented , but now I have my doub@@ ts .
Six@@ ty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment .
In the s@@ e@@ n@@ ate , there are only two independents , including me .
People have voted for a s@@ e@@ n@@ ate that will make it difficult to enforce changes .
Non@@ etheless , I will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct election of may@@ ors or regional council presidents .
Are you considering having your own party ?
I have not considered it yet , because I have neither the time to v@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ fy that every party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
I have no money even for a presidential campaign , my transparent account holds just 20 thousand .
You have no money ?
You are talking about financial disclosures , but what is y@@ ours like ?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million .
In Prague , I have land worth around 25 million , an apartment worth ten million , another apartment worth eight million , an artwork collection worth around ten million , an A@@ s@@ t@@ on Martin worth 3.5 million , a Sko@@ da Super@@ b worth a million , and I have a few million in my account .
I have the A@@ s@@ t@@ on Martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James Bond , who drove the car , was g@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ ant with women and also fought against e@@ v@@ i@@ l and v@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ y .
You drive an A@@ s@@ t@@ on Martin , have assets worth 60 million , but you have no money for a campaign ?
You say you want to change the Republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
This does not insp@@ ire much confidence .
I do not have 15 million for a campaign .
Should I take out a loan ?
I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign .
The fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme .
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign .
The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a senator .
However , I would not be able to live on it , for instance , I could not pay for my son 's English school , which costs 30 thousand a month .
If I were only interested in making money , I would not be standing for election .
So you will still be in business so that you can make a living ?
Did you not say you would be putting this on hold ?
This depends on the rate of pay .
As I promised , my activities have been p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ ally reduced .
For example , my deputy is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring .
People would like me to be a Sam@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ an , who saves the Republic .
But I must also live off something .
As a business@@ man , what would you usually make monthly ?
Two hundred to 400 thousand , which I still do .
And if I became president , then I would end my business activity .
The full interview can be read in Saturday 's issue of P@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ o .
The M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V archit@@ ects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se and the recently e@@ r@@ e@@ cted B@@ ü@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ berg ( l@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ally " book mountain " ) - 2 photos
" I think the building is fun , looks f@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ istic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at , " said Lis@@ ette V@@ e@@ r@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ g , a p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ -@@ by at the road@@ -@@ side .
And S@@ t@@ e@@ fan S@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ mon , IT technician in a major firm based nearby commented : " It 's definitely a thing of beauty , the building . "
However , I do wonder why people would need another libr@@ ary in this day and age .
Everyone has the Internet , an i@@ Pad and e@@ Books .
N@@ o@@ -@@ one goes into one of these old-@@ style libr@@ aries volun@@ tar@@ ily n@@ o@@ w@@ a@@ d@@ ays , or am I wrong ?
S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se , a sleep@@ y town outside the gates of R@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ dam , which barely merits a visit , is a special record-@@ holder .
The 80,@@ 000-@@ resident m@@ u@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality has the lowest l@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ acy rate in the whole of the Netherlands .
In order to counter@@ act this a@@ s@@ i@@ n@@ ine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to r@@ e@@ c@@ reate the seven f@@ i@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ ous bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete mini@@ atures .
The success of the education offensive was limited .
And so the city f@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ ers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statisti@@ cs : a libr@@ ary had to be built !
Win@@ y M@@ a@@ as of the R@@ o@@ t@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ dam-based architectural firm M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V , master of a@@ u@@ d@@ aci@@ ous bar charts and producer of h@@ u@@ m@@ o@@ r@@ ous and often cyn@@ ical buildings , took the project on with his customary compos@@ ure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a g@@ r@@ in on his face .
And with the judging panel still looking at him with b@@ e@@ wil@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ment , s@@ h@@ r@@ u@@ gging their shoulders , the imper@@ tin@@ ent M@@ a@@ as stacked his chosen props by order of size to form a p@@ y@@ ram@@ id and rounded off his presentation - now s@@ u@@ itably backed up with action - with the words : " Dear Mun@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality ! "
So this is my suggestion for the S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se Book Moun@@ tain - for the so-called B@@ o@@ e@@ ken@@ berg !
Nine years later , the 30-@@ m@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ -@@ euro mountain has been lifted up .
It is part of a rev@@ i@@ t@@ alisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a supermarket , a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and t@@ e@@ r@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ ed houses , with a total of 50 dw@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ings .
At the beginning of November , the B@@ ü@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ berg was awarded second place in the " Best L@@ i@@ b@@ r@@ ary of NL 2012 " competition .
In addition , the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 .
Thus , the f@@ a@@ c@@ eless small-@@ town r@@ e@@ t@@ ort , that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-@@ modern pedes@@ trian area and a s@@ t@@ u@@ n@@ n@@ ingly ugly town hall , behind whose white f@@ a@@ c@@ ades one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bol@@ stered by a piece of contemporary architecture .
First and fore@@ most , however , S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence .
The long journey to the book
The first impression : the E@@ l@@ dor@@ ado of books beneath a cheese d@@ o@@ m@@ e .
There is in fact a lift that clim@@ bs through the centre of the mountain mas@@ sif , however , the true joys of space and literature are revealed when s@@ c@@ aling the t@@ o@@ p@@ o@@ graph@@ y on foot .
The i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ior space , g@@ l@@ a@@ zed throughout , is bright and open , the fired clin@@ ker floors and the eleg@@ ant street lam@@ ps speak the u@@ n@@ mistak@@ able language of a public town square .
The urban a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ ance is perfect .
You are already on the l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ out for a park bench , a dog , and boys and girls playing football .
And everywhere there are books , books , books .
" N@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ ally book shelves run along the facade , and in the centre there is a large , dark space , which is usually unple@@ asant and i@@ m@@ personal , " says Win@@ y M@@ a@@ as .
We turned the class@@ ical s@@ p@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ al configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out .
The i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ior of the B@@ ü@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ berg is cle@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ly used : in the centre there are offices , an Internet libr@@ ary , a c@@ h@@ ess club , an environmental centre and the central technical support room .
One particularly special feature are the black book shelves , which simultaneously act as wall c@@ l@@ adding , p@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ ets and rail@@ ings for the stair@@ way .
The appearance , feel and s@@ c@@ ent are foreign .
Even die-@@ hard archit@@ ects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials .
" Here we wanted to work with recycl@@ able materials , " explained J@@ o@@ o@@ p Trou@@ b@@ o@@ r@@ st , Project Manager for the Mun@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality of S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se , on request of the Standard .
And thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a Fris@@ ian farm .
For many years , m@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ metre-@@ thick artificial fab@@ ric has been used in green@@ houses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer .
It is inexpensive and saves time .
The thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste .
For the libr@@ ary , the fab@@ ric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four-@@ c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ metre-@@ thick boards .
Under heat and pressure , the so-called Land@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ w plastic ( K@@ LP ) changes colour to a dark , h@@ o@@ m@@ o@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ e@@ ous and robust material , that s@@ m@@ ells like a mixture of new car s@@ m@@ ell and the s@@ m@@ ell of trainers .
After 105 steps you have reached the summit .
At the end of the 500-@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ er-@@ long journey , you are r@@ e@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ ded in the Liter@@ ature Café , not only with a fantastic view of the city , but also with Dutch c@@ r@@ o@@ q@@ u@@ e@@ t@@ tes and p@@ o@@ tted f@@ i@@ c@@ us trees .
These provide atmosphere , but most i@@ m@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ t@@ antly , regulate the air humidity in the l@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ary mountain range .
Don@@ ations for the new soul
" You would hardly believe it , but this building , in spite of the many glass panels , is a showcase project in the area of e@@ c@@ ology , " said Trou@@ b@@ o@@ r@@ st .
It is heated and c@@ o@@ o@@ l@@ ed using geo@@ thermal heat .
Although the B@@ ü@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ berg has a glass cover , the sun only s@@ h@@ ines only briefly into the i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ior , even on sunny days .
The broad , lam@@ inated wood glue beams p@@ o@@ s@@ i@@ tioned at right-@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ les to the glass facade , provide s@@ h@@ ade and absor@@ b the majority of the sunlight .
The indoor temperature is very pleasant .
The rest is taken care of by fully automatic roll@@ er b@@ l@@ i@@ n@@ ds .
S@@ t@@ e@@ fan S@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ mon , initially a s@@ c@@ e@@ p@@ tic of the IT sector , has already v@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ u@@ red into the new libr@@ ary .
Lis@@ ette V@@ e@@ r@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ g has also visited already .
So too has T@@ C@@ M-@@ teacher , Cyn@@ thia B@@ o@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ de , who even refers to the B@@ o@@ e@@ ken@@ berg as S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se 's " long overdue soul . "
The reason : At the inauguration just a few weeks ago , every citiz@@ en was invited to donate a book from his / her personal collection .
This was , for the time being , to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stoc@@ ked libr@@ ary - currently there are 70,000 items .
The concept has been a success .
The shelves are full to capacity .
" Nothing is worse than a half-@@ empty libr@@ ary , " said archit@@ ect Win@@ y M@@ a@@ as .
" I think that , thanks to our invitation , every resident now has a certain bond with this new building .
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building .
Even if it 's just for decor@@ ation .
As such , M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V have succeeded in mas@@ tering the master discipline that specialist j@@ a@@ r@@ g@@ on refers to as the formation of identity .
S@@ p@@ i@@ j@@ ken@@ i@@ s@@ se has written l@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ary history .
However young and uneducated it may be .
This is ultimately a starting point for identity .
S@@ z@@ abo : " Germans must play a greater role "
In the vote on the incorpor@@ ation of Palestine , Germany a@@ b@@ s@@ t@@ ained from voting .
According to Stephen S@@ z@@ abo , Exper@@ t in US-@@ European relations , in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
Deutsche W@@ elle : At the beginning of the week , Germany had initially s@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ alled that it would vote against the Palestinians ' application for o@@ b@@ server status within the United Nations .
However , Berlin subsequently a@@ b@@ s@@ t@@ ained from voting .
Why ?
Stephen S@@ z@@ abo : Germany does not support what the Israeli@@ s have done in Gaza .
Now , however , due to their special relationship with Israel , Germany must be cautious .
At the same time , however , I do not believe that it supports the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - a@@ l@@ b@@ e@@ it without being too critical of Israel .
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 , Germany like@@ wise a@@ b@@ s@@ t@@ ained from voting , when it came to establishing a no-@@ fly zone .
This was ultimately implemented by NATO .
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs ?
Yes , it does .
That is because it has just r@@ e@@ organised its foreign policy , indeed moving away from a policy that was , so to speak , managed by the USA , in favour of a German foreign policy .
This situation is aggrav@@ ated by the fact that the E@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ ans do not have a c@@ o@@ her@@ ent and s@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ ed policy .
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts .
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role , yet this is something that they are not accustom@@ ed to .
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role , but they are en route to a " more normal " foreign policy .
A foreign policy similar to that of France , or Great Britain .
So what specifically does a " normal " foreign policy e@@ n@@ t@@ ail , from a German perspective ?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters , which are independent of those of the USA or European partners .
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia , China or the Near East .
Germany 's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests .
Have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN ?
On the one hand , Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East , and particularly in the Gulf States .
Ther@@ e@@ fore it must be careful not to a@@ f@@ f@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ t the public , but also the elite in the Arabic countries .
In any case , this plays a role .
However , I wouldn 't want to a@@ s@@ c@@ r@@ i@@ be too much weight to this . This is not an entirely one-@@ sided relationship .
Non@@ etheless , it does play an important role in Germany 's consider@@ ations .
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA , by a@@ b@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ing to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on Palestine ?
I think that in Europe , and even in the USA , a great understanding for the German position prev@@ ails .
Ther@@ e@@ fore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya .
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect .
After all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered .
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative .
The USA , on the other hand , have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto .
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations ?
Due to the American domestic policy , these differences have always existed .
I think that secretly , the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation .
However , due to the political situation here , the government is natur@@ ally unable to voice this position publicly .
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear .
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Net@@ a@@ n@@ j@@ a@@ h@@ u , Obama is really not quite so enth@@ used by Net@@ a@@ n@@ j@@ a@@ h@@ u 's policies .
Does Germany find it difficult to r@@ e@@ conci@@ le its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other ?
I think that this is precis@@ ely what makes things so difficult for the Germans .
It would of course be a little s@@ i@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ er for the Germans if there were a c@@ o@@ her@@ ent and s@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ ed European policy , which is currently not the case .
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
This is precis@@ ely what they are doing with the Euro .
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a s@@ t@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ i@@ s@@ ed European position .
This is , of course , no simple task for Germany , on account of its relations with Israel .
This has always been a sensitive subject .
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role .
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult ?
Germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be uncomfortable and , for obvious reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
If we look at the Euro crisis for example , every time that Germany a@@ s@@ s@@ u@@ mes a more prominent role , various anti-@@ German feelings become apparent .
This does not make matters simple for the Germans .
This is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries .
From this stance , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA .
It must be recep@@ tive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and this is not easy .
The influence of the USA over European politics is c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ u@@ ally diminis@@ hing , yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacu@@ um , so who is filling the gap ?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role .
Even if they do not like it , even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c '@@ est la vie !

" Brand protection " in China : When P@@ u@@ m@@ a and A@@ r@@ mani suddenly become Chinese
A@@ r@@ mani is a world-@@ famous brand , Pol@@ o Ralph Lauren like@@ wise .
However , what is A@@ r@@ mani Pol@@ o ?
Behind this name hides a fully officially registered brand in China , however , one that has nothing w@@ h@@ a@@ t@@ s@@ o@@ ever to do with the original companies .
Non@@ etheless , it is enjo@@ ying protection , provided the actual creators of the names do not sue .
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights .
" It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China , " said Thomas Patt@@ loch , lawyer within the Taylor W@@ essing law firm , who speci@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ ses in copyright infr@@ ingement in the Far East .
Every week a new case lands on my desk .
All the cop@@ y@@ cats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands .
Thus Guc@@ ci simply becomes L@@ u@@ -G@@ u@@ c@@ ci , P@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ -@@ K@@ ny is registered in place of P@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ a .
German companies are also ' legally ' copied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting a@@ p@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ el , P@@ u@@ m@@ a .
Patt@@ loch opens a file containing registr@@ ations with the trademark office in P@@ e@@ king .
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copyrighted the brand name Z@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a D@@ F P@@ u@@ m@@ a there , an a@@ l@@ i@@ as that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer Er@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ l@@ do Z@@ e@@ g@@ n@@ a .
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in cop@@ ying and infr@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ing on intellectual property is well-known .
In the major cities there are multi-@@ level department stores that sell counter@@ f@@ e@@ it goods almost exclusively .
Patt@@ loch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already protected elsewhere .
The Chinese call this " Bang M@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ p@@ ai , " a passenger brand .
The word is based on " Bang D@@ a@@ k@@ uan . "
This refers to women who lat@@ ch onto rich men .
The Chinese authorities are u@@ n@@ aware of any wrong@@ doing .
" This h@@ a@@ r@@ ms business and we must fight against it , " challenges Patt@@ loch .
" The brand is watered down , its u@@ n@@ i@@ q@@ u@@ eness disappears - the image damage is enormous . "
The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions , especially in the case of expensive flagship products .
According to information from market research company CL@@ SA , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , China is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fas@@ test growing .
However , the del@@ e@@ tion of d@@ u@@ b@@ i@@ ous entries in the trademark regis@@ try are difficult to achieve , and cost a pretty penny .
The process can last for up to nine years , with an uncertain outcome .
Patt@@ loch reports of instances where@@ by the court d@@ i@@ s@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ ses cases , because after a long period of time , the name to which the objec@@ tion is being raised has become a " market reality . "
If the c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ant is unlucky , he may even have to pay the p@@ l@@ a@@ g@@ i@@ arist money for having infr@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ed on his trademark in China , said Patt@@ loch .
Sometimes the law of the jungle prev@@ ails here .
Famous cases also r@@ e@@ l@@ ate to graphic elements .
In 2009 , Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction mach@@ inery manufacturer S@@ any , the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Put@@ z@@ m@@ e@@ i@@ s@@ ter .
Even today , the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an e@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ e@@ m that r@@ e@@ s@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ les the Mercedes star .
Vol@@ v@@ o@@ -@@ purch@@ a@@ s@@ er G@@ e@@ ely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled the BMW logo ; the dispute was a@@ r@@ b@@ i@@ trated and G@@ e@@ ely was forced to change it .
Fas@@ hion house Lac@@ o@@ s@@ t@@ e lost a suit in China against cop@@ y@@ cats from Hong Kong and Singapore , who were using the famous c@@ r@@ o@@ c@@ o@@ d@@ i@@ le looking in the other direction .
The Chinese authorities are u@@ n@@ aware of any wrong@@ doing .
The CT@@ M@@ O trademark office in P@@ e@@ king does acknowledge that there were bott@@ len@@ e@@ c@@ ks in 2010 due to limited staff@@ ing and equipment .
In the past year , however , things reportedly " returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow . "
Thus the stock of u@@ n@@ processed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent .
Almost 5@@ 7,000 such c@@ a@@ s@@ ed were closed , 75 percent more than in the previous year .
Non@@ etheless , there are still 8@@ 1,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office .
To remedy this is very expensive
As is so often the case in China , the figures are imposing .
In the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CT@@ M@@ O , almost one third more than in 2010 .
This is a record and means that China , for the tent@@ h time in succession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority .
The same applies for the inventory of vali@@ d trademarks , totalling 5.@@ 5 million in number .
In 2011 , 1.8 billion yu@@ an in fees were received .
Put simply , this means that each application costs on average 1,2@@ 80 yu@@ an , or 160 euros .
To appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the German family business , Fre@@ u@@ d@@ enberg .
For more than seven years , the group has been contesting against a Chinese p@@ l@@ a@@ g@@ i@@ arist .
The Germans did in fact manage to expose the company 's illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts .
However , the cop@@ y@@ c@@ at still secured the Chinese rights to the Fre@@ u@@ d@@ enberg brand .
This is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be protected in Germany , said H@@ anno W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler , Chairman of the Board of Management at Fre@@ u@@ d@@ enberg C@@ h@@ e@@ m@@ ical Speci@@ alities in Munich .
The CT@@ M@@ O trademark office then also dismissed the M@@ u@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ -based company 's appeal .
In the next two instances , Fre@@ u@@ d@@ enberg was proven right , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day .
You have to pay extremely careful attention .
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court .
W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and p@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ ses the profession@@ alism of the courts .
However , he also says : " The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time , money and ner@@ ves . "
The internal costs can barely be calculated , the company archive even had to look through c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ury-@@ old records in order to provide proof .
Five years ago Fre@@ u@@ d@@ enberg u@@ n@@ successfully offered the opposing party a " high six-@@ figure sum in euros " as settlement .
" This shows how much this is worth to us , " says W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler .
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to s@@ p@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ing over , back into Europe .
P@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ arly if i@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ ators secure u@@ n@@ protected brand names there .
For example , a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Fre@@ u@@ d@@ enberg label for shoes and l@@ e@@ a@@ ther in Germany .
This is a business sector that the group had long vac@@ ated , yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registr@@ ation .
" You have to pay extremely careful attention , " says W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler .
Both he and Patt@@ loch advis@@ e companies to be very careful when conducting business with China .
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register " everything " that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well , " said W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler .
Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registr@@ ation fee .
In actual fact : if Fre@@ u@@ d@@ enberg were to loose at the final hur@@ dle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name , explained W@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ z@@ ler .
Or alter@@ n@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ v@@ ely we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector .
World AIDS day : S@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ p , sing , help
In Heid@@ elberg , the Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ i choir is r@@ e@@ hear@@ sing - and in the Sw@@ a@@ z@@ i@@ l@@ and , AIDS orph@@ ans are deli@@ ghted .
The history of a link that o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ comes far more than a distance of 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 33 kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ es .
First of all , the stamp@@ ing : c@@ o@@ w@@ boy boots , basketball shoes , ladies ' pumps and men 's l@@ o@@ a@@ f@@ ers attempt to find the beat on the p@@ a@@ r@@ quet floor , and quickly do just that .
One-@@ two-@@ three-@@ four .
Only then do the voices of the s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers slowly s@@ well - a@@ l@@ to , b@@ a@@ s@@ s , tenor and s@@ o@@ p@@ r@@ ano surge , b@@ e@@ g@@ u@@ ile and ha@@ u@@ n@@ t .
And F@@ i@@ e@@ te Hop@@ f , the 29-year-old c@@ o@@ n@@ d@@ u@@ ctor , almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the ensemble together with his smooth , yet wild gest@@ ures .
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psych@@ ology in Heid@@ elberg the Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ i Choir are p@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ sing a new song .
The fif@@ teen s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from human gene@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ ists to the maintenance man .
" O@@ m '@@ O@@ b@@ a@@ n@@ i " is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a different text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : Z@@ u@@ l@@ u , which is spoken by e@@ l@@ even million people in South Africa , Bot@@ swana , Les@@ otho , Mal@@ awi , Moz@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ que and in parts of Sw@@ a@@ z@@ i@@ l@@ and .
Hel@@ ping others to help themselves
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world , as according to the e@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ m@@ ations of U@@ n@@ a@@ i@@ ds , the United Nations ' programme to battle AIDS .
Of these , 2@@ 3.5 million live in South Africa .
In Sw@@ a@@ z@@ i@@ l@@ and , there are 24@@ 5,000 AIDS orph@@ ans .
Meanwhile , more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive .
The Vo@@ ices for Africa Association has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orph@@ ans in the village of E@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ j@@ eni .
70 of these attend a secondary school .
For 15 or 20 euros per month , you can become a sponsor .
This guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Gog@@ o Centre .
In Z@@ u@@ l@@ u , Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ i means story@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ er or worshipper .
In this region , no-@@ one can speak the B@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ u language flu@@ ently , but they can sing it .
For almost ten years the choir has been p@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ sing songs in this foreign , ' soft ' language , and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from : the South of Africa .
For an 8@@ ,@@ 73@@ 3@@ -@@ kilometre flight away from Heid@@ elberg , in the north west of the Sw@@ a@@ z@@ i@@ l@@ and Kingdom , lies the village of E@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ j@@ eni , which relies on the vocal power of the German choir .
F@@ o@@ r@@ ty percent are infected .
Around 2,000 people live there , some still in simple mud and straw h@@ u@@ ts , and the majority of them are children .
More than 300 of them no longer have parents , as they succumbed to the HIV virus .
In E@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ j@@ eni you get a small fore@@ shadow of the illness from which all of Sw@@ a@@ z@@ i@@ l@@ and is suffering : according to Unicef , the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world .
Cir@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ i@@ on , which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half , is barely p@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ sed by the population .
More than f@@ o@@ r@@ ty percent of people in the Sw@@ a@@ z@@ i@@ l@@ and carry the immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus , and dying in you mid-@@ thir@@ ties is by no means rare .
On a group trip to Africa in early 2005 , the Choir visited the village , but first and fore@@ most , the Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ is saw many children on the streets , lacking not only in parental care but in prac@@ tically everything else as well : food , clothing , education .
Without a school leaving certi@@ ficate , there are barely any opportunities , particularly in a poor country .
Initi@@ ally it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year .
However , just one year later , the choir established the " Vo@@ ices for Africa " Association , which since then has been looking after the AIDS orph@@ ans in E@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ j@@ eni at an almost professional level .
Facts on sexu@@ ally transmitted infections .
What are the most important sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases ?
B@@ a@@ c@@ terial ST@@ Is include s@@ y@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ lis , c@@ h@@ lam@@ ydia and g@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ hoea .
Common viral ST@@ Is are HIV , human pap@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ oma viruses , her@@ pes g@@ e@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s and hepatitis .
Cr@@ a@@ b@@ s and s@@ c@@ a@@ b@@ ies belong among the paras@@ iti@@ c ST@@ Is .
Who are the main affected groups ?
S@@ y@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ lis and g@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ hoea occur primarily in men that have i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ course with other men .
The Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four in five of all s@@ y@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ lis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men .
Among h@@ eter@@ o@@ sexual adults , c@@ h@@ lam@@ ydia infections , t@@ r@@ i@@ chom@@ oni@@ a@@ s@@ is , c@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ i@@ d@@ i@@ a@@ s@@ is ( f@@ u@@ n@@ gal ) , g@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ hoea and human pap@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ oma viruses are frequently occurring sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases .
The spread of HIV among h@@ eter@@ o@@ sexual adults in this country is relatively low ; however , around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group .
Among young people , c@@ h@@ lam@@ ydia infections are much more common than in other population groups .
According to European surveys , three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
In this country , human pap@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ oma viruses are also frequently found in young people .
How has the number of infections developed ?
Not all sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases are noti@@ fiable .
According to the Robert Koch Institute , the number of s@@ y@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ lis infections has more than doubled from 1,6@@ 97 cases in 2001 , to 3,6@@ 98 cases in 2011 .
The number of newly contracted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007 .
In 2011 there were around 2@@ ,@@ 700 cases .
This is around one tent@@ h fewer than the previous year .
Which symptoms indicate a sexu@@ ally transmitted disease ?
The i@@ n@@ f@@ ectious diseases can cause ulcers in the g@@ e@@ n@@ ital area , d@@ i@@ s@@ comfort when u@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ ating , d@@ i@@ s@@ charge , lower abdomin@@ al pain and b@@ l@@ i@@ sters or warts .
However , often they cause no pain or any other symptoms , thus remaining u@@ n@@ detected .
How can you protect yourself ?
C@@ o@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s can reduce the risk of c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ action , however , they do not offer 100 % protection .
This is because occasionally , the path@@ o@@ g@@ ens of sexu@@ ally transmitted diseases can also be passed on via s@@ m@@ e@@ ar infections and close bod@@ ily contact .
Ther@@ e@@ fore , first and fore@@ most experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examin@@ ations .
If diagno@@ sed early , the majority of ST@@ Is can be c@@ u@@ red and long-term consequences avoided .
Through sponsor@@ ships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany , the money all adds up .
" In total , we have already sent around 200,000 euros to E@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ j@@ eni , " said Ann@@ ette L@@ e@@ n@@ n@@ a@@ r@@ tz , C@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ person of the association .
In the village itself , Z@@ od@@ w@@ a D@@ lam@@ ini , a self-@@ assured and asser@@ tive woman , m@@ a@@ n@@ ages the money from Germany .
She makes sure that the orph@@ ans have good accommod@@ ation , for example with one of their g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ mothers .
The G@@ o@@ g@@ o@@ s , as the old ladies are called in Z@@ u@@ l@@ u , are the p@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ars of the village .
Some of them have up to 14 orph@@ ans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes pun@@ ctu@@ ally every day , in their school uniforms .
Anyone who doesn 't have anyone left , arrives at the shelter with Kh@@ a@@ n@@ y@@ i@@ s@@ ile , a single woman who e@@ a@@ r@@ ns the same salary from the association as the two c@@ o@@ o@@ ks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day .
In addition , " Vo@@ ices for Africa " has established a sewing school , built two chicken c@@ o@@ o@@ p@@ s and , together with the American health organisation , PS@@ I , organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV .
This is nothing to be taken for granted , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead .
A king with 14 wives
" AIDS is an absolute tabo@@ o subject , " said Ann@@ ette L@@ e@@ n@@ n@@ a@@ r@@ tz , " because it is associated with sexuality . "
This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives .
The last absolute monarch of sub-@@ Sa@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ an Africa , King M@@ s@@ w@@ a@@ t@@ i III . , is known for his excessive lifestyle .
Poly@@ gam@@ y in place of democracy .
Among other factors , the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially s@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ tioned lifestyle .
Another factor is the large number of migr@@ ant workers who carry the virus across the country .
There are free condoms on every corner , said Ann@@ ette L@@ e@@ n@@ n@@ a@@ r@@ tz , " but they are hardly used .
The culture prescri@@ bes otherwise - flesh to flesh . "
In order to promote the cultural exchange , the Im@@ b@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ i choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and s@@ ings songs of mel@@ anch@@ o@@ l@@ y , fighting spirit , confidence and black self-@@ este@@ em , which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of a@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ id .
A bus full of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy , but some grim@@ -faced border soldiers even shed a few tears .
The journey always leads to E@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ j@@ eni , where the s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers visit their sponsor children .
Even though you can barely find the small village on a map , it is more than well-known in the valley of the E@@ z@@ u@@ l@@ w@@ eni River .
" Go to E@@ s@@ i@@ t@@ j@@ eni , that 's where the light is , " say the people there .
And if you make the 8@@ ,@@ 73@@ 3@@ -@@ kilometre flight back to Heid@@ elberg , to visit the s@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ ping s@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ ers in their rehearsal room , you 'll see that the light is there too .
Mess@@ enger : NASA d@@ i@@ s@@ covers ice on Mercury
The Mess@@ enger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury .
It is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick .
The US space agency , NASA , has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury .
Although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have frozen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine " Science . "
The Mess@@ enger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies perman@@ ently in shadow .
This is thought to be at east 30 c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ metres and perhaps up to 20 metres thick .
The water presumably came from comets or perhaps also a@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ ids that i@@ m@@ p@@ acted with Mercury .
However , no-@@ one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet , said Chief Scientist for the Mess@@ enger probe , Sean Sol@@ omon .
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 4@@ 26 degrees Celsius .
That said , the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system .
U@@ n@@ known to the majority of the Earth 's i@@ n@@ habit@@ ants , there are probes , t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es and small robots such as the Phoenix , deployed to research the depths of the universe .

Our view of the universe : the most important t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es
The telescope is thought to have been invented in 1608 by Hans L@@ i@@ pper@@ hey - even before G@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ l@@ e@@ o G@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ l@@ e@@ i used the device to o@@ b@@ serve the stars one year later .
Since then , the mirrors in optical t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es have become increasingly large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound .
For a period of 30 years , nam@@ ely from 1@@ 9@@ 47 until 1975 , the Hale telescope in the P@@ a@@ l@@ o@@ m@@ ar Ob@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ atory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world .
The mirror , shown in the image , had a diameter of five metres .
Arizona , USA , is home to the Large Bin@@ o@@ c@@ ular Telescope .
It enables views of space via two mirrors , each with a diameter of 8.4 metres .
The inner workings of the G@@ r@@ an Tel@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ io C@@ a@@ n@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ as on the C@@ a@@ n@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ an island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres .
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is s@@ e@@ g@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ed - to reduce costs .
In spite of this it achiev@@ es a diameter of around e@@ l@@ even metres .
The d@@ i@@ s@@ advantage of this inexpensive construction method : the telescope is s@@ e@@ c@@ u@@ rely clamp@@ ed at its angle of inclination and its movement is therefore limited .
The Hob@@ by E@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ ly telescope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inclination .
What sets it apart : the high ligh@@ t@@ -@@ gathering capacity .
This - in spite of its compar@@ atively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world 's largest r@@ e@@ f@@ l@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ or t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es .

This is home to the Very Large Telescope , which lives up to its name .
With its total of four mirrors , the telescope can also focus on the medi@@ al infr@@ ared spectrum .
L@@ i@@ k@@ e@@ wise to be located at the E@@ S@@ O Ob@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ atory in Chile , the European Extrem@@ ely Large Telescope is also being planned .
Its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements .
However , images are not to be expected until 2@@ 0@@ 18 at the earliest .
Until 2007 , the two K@@ eck t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es at the Haw@@ a@@ i@@ ian v@@ o@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ o , M@@ a@@ una Ke@@ a , were the largest in the world .
They each have two mirrors , each with a diameter of ten meters .
The K@@ eck Tel@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es are part of the M@@ a@@ una Ke@@ a Ob@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ atory , which alongside the K@@ eck t@@ e@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cop@@ es , can look to the heav@@ ens with the help of the S@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ u telescope and the IR@@ TT@@ F .
Another huge new telescope is also to be built on the M@@ a@@ una Ke@@ a , with a mirror diameter of thir@@ ty metres .
Here you can m@@ a@@ r@@ v@@ el at an artist 's impression .
However , the most important insights into space are provided by the Hubble space telescope .
Since 24 April 1990 it has been suppl@@ ying images of distant worlds .
Since March 2009 the Ke@@ p@@ l@@ er space telescope has been searching for extra@@ -@@ solar plan@@ ets , especially for any that may be i@@ n@@ habit@@ able .
On 2 February 2011 it was announced by NASA that 1,2@@ 35 plan@@ e@@ t@@ ary candidates had been identified since the mission began .
The image documents the final launch preparations on the Ke@@ p@@ l@@ er space telescope .
The James Web@@ b Space Telescope ( J@@ WS@@ T ) will be launched into space on board an Ari@@ a@@ n@@ e@@ 5 rocket by 2@@ 0@@ 18 at the earliest .
The primary mirror of the infr@@ ared space telescope has a diameter of 6.@@ 5 metres .
One of the telescope 's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and gal@@ ax@@ ies that emerged after the Big Bang .
Scienti@@ sts are assuming that ice also exists at Mercury 's south p@@ o@@ le .
However , there is no reliable data in support of this as the Mess@@ enger orb@@ its around the plan@@ ets much closer to the north p@@ o@@ le .
For decades , radar m@@ e@@ a@@ s@@ u@@ rements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury .
Thanks to the Mess@@ enger probe that was launched in 2004 , the first to orbit Mercury , scientists can now be certain .

In Southern Az@@ erbai@@ jan , many people reach ages that can almost be considered bibli@@ cal .
There is even a museum of l@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ v@@ ity .
A hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still compar@@ atively young .
The journey through the Tal@@ y@@ s@@ h Mountains can be described as wild and rom@@ antic .
The mini@@ bus rum@@ bles over the w@@ i@@ n@@ ding streets , past dens@@ ely w@@ o@@ o@@ ded hills , r@@ aging rivers and simple farm@@ houses .
Every@@ where is green and lush - you could be f@@ o@@ r@@ given for thinking you were in the Black Forest .
However , this is the deep south of Az@@ erbai@@ jan , and the border with Iran is just a few kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ es away .
This is the home of the Caucas@@ ian people group , the Tal@@ y@@ s@@ h , of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Az@@ e@@ r@@ i and live long lives .
The final stop is L@@ eri@@ k .
The small town is bursting with o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ powering architecture from Soviet times , which doesn 't fit with the pic@@ turesque mountain landscape at all .
Tour@@ ists from Europe rarely come here ; the journey from Az@@ erbai@@ jan 's capital city , B@@ a@@ k@@ u , is too a@@ r@@ d@@ u@@ ous .
It takes eight hours to travel the 3@@ 23 kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ es , as too much of the route is just a single track .
The fabulous wealth , for which the country has its oil in the Cas@@ p@@ i@@ an Sea to than@@ k , has not yet arrives here in the province .
Yet Pil@@ a@@ t@@ a F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a ( 48 ) is convinced that L@@ eri@@ k has what it takes to be a tourist attraction .
" B@@ a@@ k@@ u became famous in May due to the Euro@@ vision Song C@@ o@@ n@@ test , and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world , " said F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a .
She is the Director of the Museum of Long@@ e@@ v@@ ity , most likely the only of its kind in the world .
Here the lives of eight dozen Tal@@ y@@ s@@ h from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented . F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a points out a black & white photo .
This here is my grandfather , he was 120 years old .
At the age of 1@@ 36 he fath@@ ered another child .
However , the u@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ v@@ alled star of the museum is s@@ h@@ e@@ p@@ her@@ d S@@ h@@ i@@ r@@ ali M@@ u@@ s@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ v who is said to have lived to 168 years old .
However no birth certi@@ ficate exists to confirm this .
And given that the longest confirmed lif@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ an was 122 years of age , M@@ u@@ s@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ v 's claim seems extremely doub@@ t@@ ful .
" He was born in 1@@ 8@@ 05 , here in the region , and died in 1973 , " explains F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a .
The man married three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fath@@ ered another daughter at the age of 1@@ 36 .
So did S@@ h@@ i@@ r@@ ali M@@ u@@ s@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ o@@ v m@@ i@@ s@@ calculate his age by a couple of decades ?
But Remb@@ rand@@ t S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ z , researcher on age@@ ing at the Max Planck Institute in R@@ o@@ stock , has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia .
" A stri@@ kingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China , in Japan or the Hun@@ za Valley in Pakistan , " said S@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ z , " while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in S@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ a . "
Due to lacking documentation , however , there is no scientific proof of age , particularly as there are no birth r@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ ers .
Mel@@ ted butter by the glass , every day
However , the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding L@@ eri@@ k reach a bibli@@ cal age with striking regul@@ a@@ r@@ ity .
There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age .
So why do so many very old people live here in the south ?
The Az@@ e@@ r@@ i travel guide F@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ d M@@ u@@ g@@ i@@ m@@ zadeh explains this as being due to the special Tal@@ y@@ s@@ h gene@@ tics .
In contrast , Museum Director F@@ a@@ t@@ u@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a believes that it is due to diet .
However the notion that the c@@ a@@ l@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ -@@ rich diet of the Tal@@ y@@ s@@ h , who love meat , bread and especially dairy products , and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either .
Or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? In C@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ emir@@ an , a tiny settlement not far from the town of L@@ eri@@ k , lives Ru@@ bab@@ a Mir@@ z@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a .
At 97 years old she is still compar@@ atively young for the area .
Mir@@ z@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a , who claims to have 1@@ 4@@ 3 d@@ e@@ s@@ c@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ants , lives in a simple wooden house , which is typical of the entire Caucasus region .
She sits on the floor with a butter chur@@ n , which she rolls back@@ wards and f@@ o@@ r@@ wards tirel@@ essly .
Eight people live here under this roof , including one of Mir@@ z@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a 's sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grandparents for some time .
There are also two small children running around .
In the kitchen , tea is prepared for the guests , which is served in typical , bul@@ ging A@@ r@@ m@@ a@@ du glasses .
Mir@@ z@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a 's white teeth stand in perfect rank and file , beneath her head@@ scar@@ f she conce@@ als long , dark blond p@@ l@@ a@@ i@@ ts , which her son proudly reveals for us .
I have always washed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its colour .
" I have never used s@@ h@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ o@@ o either , " said Mir@@ z@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a .
M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ h@@ ly pension is enough to live on
She has only ever eaten what she could get from her own farm - tom@@ atoes , p@@ o@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ oes , peas .
My whole life I have never once bought g@@ r@@ o@@ c@@ e@@ r@@ ies in the supermarket .
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army .
Things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War .
However , everything became better when the " bel@@ oved father " H@@ e@@ y@@ dar Ali@@ y@@ e@@ v took the rud@@ der .
The propag@@ anda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady .
Yet the cult that revol@@ ved around the father figure for the nation , who g@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ ed his country like a dictat@@ or prac@@ tically knows no limits in Az@@ erbai@@ jan .
He held power until 2003 and his son Il@@ ham later took over the helm .
At least there is no depriv@@ ation among Az@@ erbai@@ jan 's elderly .
Mir@@ z@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a receives 230 M@@ a@@ n@@ at ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her pension , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably .
And perhaps Mir@@ z@@ a@@ y@@ e@@ v@@ a 's long g@@ r@@ e@@ ying son is right : " The elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture . "
They live among their extended family , are loved , cared for and are happy .
If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible , then what is ?
The notion of " human rights " is o@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ ted from the constitution .
The revolution has returned to Cairo .
C@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ e@@ ting demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division within the country .
The future constitution based on S@@ h@@ aria law is fier@@ cely disputed .
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emo@@ tion .
We must make the transition .
" And making sure it succeeds is my responsibility , before the people and before God , " he said on state television .
His speech was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the Cop@@ tic Christians , the liber@@ als , enligh@@ tened Muslims and secular@@ ists .
For all of them , until now hop@@ e@@ l@@ essly estr@@ anged in a b@@ e@@ wil@@ dered opposition , are fear@@ ful .
They are fear@@ ful of a God State on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim B@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ hood .
According to Mohamed Mur@@ si , speaking almost a@@ p@@ o@@ l@@ o@@ g@@ e@@ tically , he has temporarily restric@@ ted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority , " in order to rescue the revolution . "
However , Egyp@@ tians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a Do@@ c@@ t@@ orate from the American University of Southern California , really wants to save .
Should the judiciary be deprived of power ?
In actual fact , the 234 articles , which have been pushed through by the Islam@@ ic-@@ dominated 1@@ 10-@@ person C@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ ent Assembly , are in some aspects cause for concern .
As was also the case under previous constitu@@ tions , under the draft j@@ u@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ ature is justified on the " principles of Islamic law . "
Yet what are " principles " ?
This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islam@@ ists will make use of the wo@@ olly f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ ulation and the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stric@@ ter interpretation of S@@ h@@ aria law .
This is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues affecting S@@ h@@ aria law , the Al Ash@@ ar University must be consul@@ ted , the country 's most important Islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of Sunni Islam .
This can , but does not necessarily have to mean that the clergy will oversee legislation , which would result in the de facto i@@ n@@ capac@@ itation of the judiciary .
Much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation
Also problematic : civil military jurisdiction will continue to be upheld .
During M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak 's rule , these courts served to s@@ u@@ p@@ press opposition .
Following the fall of the dictat@@ or , up to 1@@ 1,000 civilians were under military imprison@@ ment .
According to the draft , the state should also protect " the true character of the Egyptian family , and promote its m@@ o@@ r@@ als and values . "
From a legal perspective , this is f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ ulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of c@@ i@@ n@@ ematic art and literature .
In plain language , this is nothing other than c@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ r@@ ship .
I@@ n@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ally , no article explic@@ itly e@@ s@@ t@@ abli@@ s@@ h@@ es the equality of men and women .
Another does prohi@@ bit the insul@@ t or sl@@ ander of the proph@@ et Mohamed and his e@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ s@@ aries .
However , what constitu@@ tes an insul@@ t and how this should be s@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ tioned remains unclear .
Equ@@ ally d@@ u@@ b@@ i@@ ous is the f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ ulation stating that " insulting people " is forbidden .
Is a caricature of the president sufficient , or a joke at the expense of a j@@ u@@ r@@ ist ?
Open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by Mur@@ si to be signed and that , in his own words , will be submitted to Egyp@@ tians for referendum " very soon . "
" The revolution is back "
For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islam@@ ists .
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the T@@ a@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ r Square in Cairo , in unfamiliar unity , and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect .
" The revolution is back and we are going to be victori@@ ous , " said Ham@@ d@@ in Sab@@ b@@ a@@ h@@ i , third place candidate in the presidential elections .
Noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority , Mohamed E@@ l@@ -@@ B@@ a@@ r@@ ade@@ i explained that the constitutional draft belongs " on the rub@@ bish tip of history . "
Via SMS service Tw@@ itter , he accused Mur@@ si 's followers of wanting to lead " a coup against democracy . "
" If he calls for the referendum , we will go to his pal@@ ace and o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ throw him , " said member of the opposition J@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ er Said .
" We have not yet grown tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been a@@ t@@ oned for , " stated the Egyptian media , q@@ u@@ o@@ ting opposition politician C@@ h@@ aled Ali .
And several judges have s@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ alled that they do not want to oversee the referendum , which would rend@@ er it i@@ n@@ v@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ d .
" The Kor@@ an is our constitution "
The well-@@ organised Muslim B@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ hood gathered for a counter@@ -@@ demonstration , although acting cautiously they did not choose the T@@ a@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ r Square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile , outside the Cairo University .
Many veiled women and followers of the Sal@@ a@@ f@@ is took part , shouting out : " The people demand the application of God 's law . "
They demanded of Mur@@ si : " Cle@@ a@@ n@@ se the country ! " and p@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ ested : " The Kor@@ an is our constitution . "
A struggle for control over the symbolic T@@ a@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ r Square , where everything began , would have most likely provoked events v@@ e@@ r@@ ging on civil war .
Quite clearly , this was something that Mur@@ si 's followers did not want to risk .
The Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
Now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box , in which direction the country should move forward .
It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islam@@ ists ' draft .
" The term ' human rights ' does not even appear once "
H@@ a@@ f@@ ez Abu Sa@@ eda is fur@@ i@@ ous about this forced constitu@@ tive process , which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups .
The 48-@@ year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights ( E@@ O@@ HR ) defended the Muslim B@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ hood , when impris@@ oned or in court under M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak .
Not because he shared their world view , but because for him , human rights are i@@ n@@ d@@ i@@ visible .
For this he was bat@@ tered , condemned and impris@@ oned .
" And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution , " he b@@ emo@@ a@@ n@@ ed in a discussion with " Wel@@ t am Sonn@@ tag . "
The lawyer has resigned himself to Mur@@ si ext@@ ending his power to all three branches of state government .
These measures are blatant breaches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictat@@ orship .
" Instead of s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ g@@ t@@ h@@ ening the civil society , the President is effectively s@@ u@@ s@@ p@@ ending it , " complained Sa@@ eda .
Yet without civil society organisations , a democracy cannot function .
Sa@@ eda feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the Nile with a mixture of c@@ u@@ r@@ i@@ os@@ ity and excitement .
This could come back to ha@@ u@@ n@@ t them .
One demonstr@@ ator at the T@@ a@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ r warned : " You are letting loose a monster that you can no longer control . "
Norway 's r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k : Is this the world 's s@@ m@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ i@@ est fish ?
Norway 's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living , not just in Europe , but in the world .
Could the secret of the country 's success be connected to the local a@@ p@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ i@@ te for some exceed@@ ingly s@@ m@@ elly fish ?
Take a selection of over-@@ r@@ i@@ pe c@@ h@@ e@@ e@@ s@@ es .
Place them in the mid@@ st of a pile of dirty , wet socc@@ er kit .
Leave for a week .
Now you have the nose-@@ n@@ u@@ m@@ bing s@@ m@@ ell of r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k , one of the great Norwegian d@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ c@@ ies .
I am in the small town of F@@ a@@ g@@ ern@@ es , about three hours from Osl@@ o .
There is snow , spectacular scener@@ y - and that od@@ our , ever present , hang@@ s in the air .
R@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k is t@@ r@@ out sprin@@ k@@ led with salt and f@@ e@@ r@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ed in water for - depending on how s@@ m@@ elly you like your fish - up to a year .
As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold , N@@ o@@ r@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ans f@@ lock to a festival here in F@@ a@@ g@@ ern@@ es devoted to this most , well , captiv@@ ating of foods .
" You eat it raw , and then s@@ w@@ allow a glass of aqu@@ a@@ v@@ it , " says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ v@@ a@@ r@@ sen , full-time local firefighter but also the so-called " R@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k General , " in charge of running the festival .
All around us people are eating little cubes of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink .
" Some people like the aqu@@ a@@ v@@ it more than the r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k , " says Hav@@ ard .
The drink can kill the s@@ m@@ ell .
I try a few pieces .
If you can avoid passing it under your n@@ o@@ se , it is not bad - not unlike a slice of s@@ u@@ s@@ h@@ i that has been on rather a long bus journey .
R@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k is a product of very different , p@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ty-@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ en times in Norway when , pre-@@ refriger@@ ation , fish was s@@ o@@ aked in a@@ i@@ r@@ tight barrels of water and salt in autumn .
Then in the depths of winter , well and truly f@@ e@@ r@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ed , it is taken out and - no doubt with the s@@ e@@ n@@ ses knocked out by alcohol - eaten .
Only a generation ago , thousands of N@@ o@@ r@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , emigr@@ ating mainly to the US .
Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by p@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ ful jobs , high wages and a comprehensive care system .
People from Sweden , the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway , stream in to work .
R@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k is seen as s@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ fying something important , a vital if rather s@@ m@@ elly part of Norway 's past .
It is among the more expensive dishes you can buy .
But then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich knock you back £ 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way .
People here are still l@@ o@@ ath to mention by name Anders Bre@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ k , the right-@@ wing , racist extrem@@ ist who gun@@ ned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
Instead , the shootings are referred to as " the July the 22nd incident . "
N@@ o@@ r@@ w@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ ans find it very difficult to believe that in their p@@ e@@ a@@ c@@ e@@ -@@ loving country one of their own was capable of such bru@@ tali@@ ty and murder .
The growth since the early 1970s of one of the world 's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway 's p@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ ent-@@ day wealth .
" But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , " says Anna our wai@@ t@@ ress , handing round trays of maturing r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k and , with her long blond hair and s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ l@@ ingly blue eyes , the image of N@@ o@@ r@@ dic well-@@ being .
We are a - how you say - prudent people .
Her English , like that of most people here , is f@@ l@@ a@@ w@@ less .
We are not very s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ y , we do not like o@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ation .
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future gener@@ ations .
When everyone else was throwing around money they did not have , in the years leading up to the global financial crash , Norway kept its pur@@ se strings tightly bound .
" As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer we are happy , " says Anna .
" And eat r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k , " she adds with a care@@ free laugh .
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k .
Now an e@@ l@@ k burger is certainly something different and rather s@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ ent to the taste .
But in the evening , it is more of that s@@ m@@ elly fish .
The hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most n@@ a@@ s@@ ally challenging - fish .
There is a live TV link up to a c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ e@@ r@@ e in a b@@ o@@ w tie surrounded by p@@ l@@ ates of r@@ a@@ k@@ f@@ i@@ s@@ k .
It is like the Euro@@ vision song contest .
" What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains T@@ h@@ or-@@ J@@ u@@ e@@ r@@ g@@ en ? "
" Here are our points , Hav@@ ard . "
There is clapping , laugh@@ ter .
A man falls off his chair , perhaps overcome with aqu@@ a@@ v@@ it .
Or maybe it is the fum@@ es from all that fish .
Mexico 's E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to faces tough start
As Mexico 's incoming President E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to prepar@@ es to take office , the BBC 's Will Grant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present .
A c@@ o@@ n@@ ges@@ ted city at the best of times , a ring of steel has been e@@ r@@ e@@ cted since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing c@@ h@@ a@@ os on the roads .
The aim , however , wasn 't to stop commut@@ ers getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament .
On Saturday , Mexico 's new president E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to will receive the presidential s@@ ash and take over the running of the nation .
He faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been performing well economically under the o@@ u@@ t@@ going administration of F@@ eli@@ pe Calderon , but the country is in the grip of a drug war , which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years .
" My government has a great commitment to the Mex@@ ican people to reduce the violence , " Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week .
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim .
Before rub@@ bing shoulders with the US president , Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to 's previous political experience was as governor of his home state , the State of Mexico .
A p@@ o@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ous , sprawling state surrounding the capital , opinions about the new leader are divided in his old s@@ t@@ o@@ m@@ ping ground .
A strai@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ forward man
In the b@@ u@@ c@@ o@@ lic town of Val@@ le del B@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ o , for example , he is remembered f@@ o@@ n@@ dly .
Residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure .
To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to 's new motor@@ ways , a vast improvement on the cracked and b@@ u@@ mp@@ y roads it replaced .
P@@ l@@ a@@ ques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change .
" We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change , " says friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ a Hern@@ andez , a state cong@@ ressman for Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to 's party , the PR@@ I .
P@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ arly in terms of security and the economy , we 're hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so bad@@ ly needs .
After an u@@ n@@ broken 81 years in power , the PR@@ I was ousted in 2000 by Vic@@ ente Fox .
Cong@@ ressman Ol@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ a admits that after 12 years outside the presidential pal@@ ace of Los Pin@@ os , there is much expectation within the party about E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to .
And he rejects the opposition 's character@@ i@@ s@@ ation of the new president as lacking substance .
He 's a very strai@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ forward man , very committed with an excellent vision of the country .
He 's an excellent s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ esman and , above all , he 's someone who knows how to listen .
But on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their former governor .
In N@@ e@@ z@@ a@@ h@@ u@@ alco@@ y@@ o@@ t@@ l , also known as Ci@@ udad N@@ e@@ za , the contrast with the c@@ o@@ b@@ bled streets of Val@@ le del B@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ o couldn 't be sharper .
Tuc@@ ked away under motorway f@@ l@@ y@@ overs , it is in many ways a subur@@ b of Mexico City itself .
And the problems in the m@@ u@@ n@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ ality are also g@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ ty and urban .
Earlier this year , the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ hoods , and violence against women is particularly acute .
On a patch of was@@ teland by a vast land@@ fill site , the bodies of dozens of mur@@ dered women have been dumped over the past two years alone .
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to was governor , a rate much higher than in the notori@@ ously violent city of Ci@@ udad J@@ u@@ a@@ r@@ ez - a place s@@ y@@ non@@ y@@ m@@ ous with the murder of innocent women .
Mr P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to 's critics say , at best , he failed to ade@@ quately address the problem of f@@ e@@ m@@ icide while he was in office .
At worst , they a@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ se his administration of turning a blind eye .
In a concrete home typical of the rundown n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ hood , Ir@@ ine@@ a Bu@@ e@@ n@@ dia strugg@@ les to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter , Mari@@ ana Lun@@ a .
According to the official version of events , Mari@@ ana committed suicide in 2010 .
However her family believes she was mur@@ dered by her partner .
" When I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been washed , " S@@ e@@ n@@ ora Bu@@ e@@ n@@ dia recalls .
There were signs she 'd been beaten , and rig@@ or m@@ o@@ r@@ tis had already set in .
As her mother r@@ e@@ c@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ ts the story , a picture of Mari@@ ana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a single word : Justice .
However , that is exactly what the family say they have been denied .
The state authorities have treated me like I 'm an old gossip , a t@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ b@@ l@@ e@@ -@@ maker , a w@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ er .
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and s@@ h@@ u@@ ts up .
" But that can 't be right when there were so many i@@ r@@ regul@@ arities and omissions , " she says .
As President P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to receives the s@@ ash on Saturday , it comes with a heavy responsibility .
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
" I hope he 's the same kind of president as he was a governor , " says PR@@ I Cong@@ ressman Ol@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ a in Val@@ le del B@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ o .
That , however , is exactly what victims ' families in Ci@@ udad N@@ e@@ za most fear .
Bradley Manning didn 't complain about m@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ ment , prosecutors contend
Prosecutors try to counter Bradley Manning 's claims of abuse in confin@@ ement
The hearing focuses on Manning 's time in the military brig at Q@@ u@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o , Virginia
Defense wants case dismissed on grounds that Manning 's confin@@ ement was harsh
The Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents
Prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bradley Manning -- charged in the largest l@@ e@@ ak of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the m@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ ment he 's alleging he suffered in military custody .
While cross-@@ examin@@ ing Manning at a pre-@@ trial hearing at F@@ t . M@@ e@@ ade , Maryland , prosecutor Maj@@ . Ash@@ den Fe@@ in asserted that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Q@@ u@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o , Virginia , show no complaints about his treatment .
The cross-@@ examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have Manning 's case dismissed on grounds that his confin@@ ement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody .
The Army intelligence analyst , arrested in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq .
The material was then published online by Wiki@@ L@@ e@@ aks .
Wiki@@ L@@ e@@ aks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information .
In Friday 's hearing , Fe@@ in reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Q@@ u@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o 's brig , where he was held under a heightened confin@@ ement status from July 2010 to April 2011 .
Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses .
When Fe@@ in asked about the forms Friday , Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as " excellent " and treatment by the facility overall as " very professional . "
The forms show no complaints of m@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ ment , even though the officers asked Manning directly about his treatment , Fe@@ in c@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ ended .
Manning responded that he would v@@ e@@ r@@ b@@ ally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they didn 't record the issues .
" They would write down ' no issues ' ( after discus@@ sing the concerns ) , and it didn 't necessarily mean I didn 't bring something up , " Manning said .
The judge , Army Col. Denise L@@ ind , also asked Manning why he didn 't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examin@@ ing the s@@ u@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ al thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier .
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get his " prevention of injury " status down@@ grad@@ ed .
The military said they put him on this restric@@ tive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others .
" I wanted staff to know I was fine , and ( I wanted to ) get off the P@@ O@@ I status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my vie@@ w@@ point , " Manning said .
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait , where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the brig at Marine Base Q@@ u@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o in Virginia in July 2010 .
He said he contempl@@ ated suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there due to the heat .
He said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was dist@@ ressing .
" My world just shr@@ ink to Cam@@ p A@@ r@@ a@@ f@@ j@@ on , to that cage , " Manning said Thursday .
I thought I was going to die in that cage .
Once at Q@@ u@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o , Manning said , he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company .
Manning said he was allowed only a matt@@ ress , blan@@ ket , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps , some clothes and his glasses .
He said he tried to keep moving , because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules .
Manning said he always slept with light from outside his cell in his eyes .
If guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
Manning 's lawyer filed a formal objec@@ tion to Manning 's treatment in January 2011 .
Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Leaven@@ worth , Kansas , in April 2011 .
Also Friday , the judge asked Manning about an alleg@@ ation that he made in Thursday 's testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Q@@ u@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o cell , he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count .
Manning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blan@@ ket during the head count .
Under questioning from the judge Friday , Manning said that he i@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ red from his guard 's order that he should drop a blan@@ ket that could have covered him , but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it .
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn 't a danger to himself .
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the wai@@ s@@ t@@ band of his underwear or his fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps to hurt himself but hadn 't done so .
That night , Manning testified , his underwear , fli@@ p-@@ flo@@ ps and glasses were removed from his cell .
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confin@@ ement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his c@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ t-marti@@ al , which is expected to begin early next year .
The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to less@@ er offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme .
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend , with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warran@@ ted .
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accord@@ ance with rules governing all maxim@@ um-@@ custody detainees at Q@@ u@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ c@@ o .
C@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ ts against Manning include a@@ i@@ ding the enemy , wrong@@ fully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet , transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records .
If he 's convicted on all counts , he could face a life sentence .
My Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans tend to fault those who left ; they remind Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans of hard times , he says
Nav@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ t@@ te says Mex@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City , I had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got stum@@ ped .
Signs pointed the way to two lines : one for " Mex@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ os " ( " Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans " ) , another for " E@@ x@@ tran@@ jer@@ os " ( " Fore@@ igners . " )
I stood there for a few seconds , unsure of where to go .
G@@ rowing up in Central California , I had been called a " Mex@@ ican " my entire life .
It 's ethnic shor@@ t@@ h@@ and in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as " Irish " or my friends in New York describe themselves as " Italian . "
Later , I settled on " Mex@@ i@@ c@@ an-American . "
But , this was Mexico .
And , in the homeland of my grandfather , there was no need for shor@@ t@@ h@@ and or hy@@ p@@ h@@ ens .
I was simply an American .
I speak Spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language .
But I don 't have the voc@@ abulary of a native , and I can 't shake my American accent .
So I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for E@@ x@@ tran@@ jer@@ os .
I thought about that moment this week when Mex@@ ican presid@@ ent-@@ elect E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to visited the White House to meet with President Obama .
On the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries meet : immigration , drugs and trade .
P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mex@@ ican economy , which is one reason that Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States .
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada , and create a European U@@ n@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ -@@ style trading bloc in North America .
And P@@ ena N@@ i@@ e@@ to vowed to continue Mexico 's war against the drug c@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ els , even though he offered no speci@@ fics .
For Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings .
Most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 1@@ 8@@ 48 , the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle .
But for Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans , who think in terms of centuries , not minutes , the r@@ e@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ ders are everywhere .
So the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico , you start hearing -- in the Mex@@ ican press , and among the eli@@ tes -- complaints about how the Americans are e@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ o@@ aching upon their neighbor 's sovere@@ ignty .
And the children of M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ m@@ a go on the w@@ a@@ r@@ path .
And yet , for Mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mex@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Americans living in the United States .
You want to talk about hard feelings ?
There is plenty .
Mexico has winners and l@@ o@@ s@@ ers , people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn 't .
The only reason you have so many people of Mex@@ ican a@@ n@@ c@@ estry living in cities like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Phoenix , Denver or San Antonio is because , at some point in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ parent , who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north .
And more often than not , that person fit a profile -- dark skin , little education , from a poor village , e@@ t@@ c .
We 're their offspring , and we 're loyal to them .
Not Mexico .
And even though we may now be living the American Dream , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it 's the American Dream we 're living , and not the Mex@@ ican one .
Our identity might sometimes be f@@ u@@ z@@ zy , but our loy@@ alty is clear .
It 's to the United States .
Besides , we 're aware that many of the elite Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans in the ruling class don 't like us .
The feeling is mutual .
They see us as a reminder of a h@@ u@@ m@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ating defeat and look down on us as i@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ior stock that isn 't sufficiently Mex@@ ican .
Our Spanish will never be good enough , our ties to Mexico never strong enough .
Our existence is , as they see it , all about failure .
If our families hadn 't failed in Mexico , they wouldn 't have left .
And we wouldn 't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain , living well in the United States but lost s@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ s nonetheless .
My wife , who was born in G@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ l@@ aj@@ ara and came to the United States legally as a child , reminds me that there is f@@ r@@ i@@ c@@ tion between Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans and Mex@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Americans because Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans have a firmer gras@@ p of who they are and Mex@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Americans r@@ e@@ s@@ ent that .
While she 's a U.S. citiz@@ en , she sees herself as a part of two countries .
Meanwhile , many Mex@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Americans I know don 't feel like they 're a part of either .
We love listening to the Mex@@ ican band , Los T@@ i@@ g@@ res del Norte , but also to Bruce Springsteen .
You get the best of both worlds , but you 're rooted in neither .
In Mexico , we 're seen as Americans .
And in the United States , we 're considered Mex@@ ican .
Now , to complic@@ ate the relationship even further , as I learned during my trip , some Mex@@ ican leaders and parts of the intellig@@ entsia want to r@@ e@@ connect with the D@@ i@@ a@@ s@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ a .
They want to put Mex@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Americans to work as makeshift " ambass@@ adors " for Mexico , representing its interest in the United States .
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico .
Ye@@ ah .
That 's not going to happen .
Too many hard feelings .
And , with income inequality and ramp@@ ant corruption and drug violence , many of us are not so sure that it is a great country .
I 'm afraid you 're on your own , a@@ m@@ i@@ g@@ os .
That 's fair .
If at least some Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans aren 't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago , then they have to accept the fact that some Mex@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ -@@ Americans still hold a grud@@ ge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that .
H@@ m@@ mm .
Maybe we 're more " Mex@@ ican " than I thought .
Old batt@@ les , new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East ?
Another round of blood@@ shed suggests that any such hope is v@@ ain .
A@@ m@@ i@@ d the usual futile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to r@@ u@@ b@@ ble ; more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israeli@@ s have been killed ; and , for the first time , missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv , Israel 's m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ s , and the holy city of Jerusalem .
But though the Israeli@@ s and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict , all around them the Middle East is changing .
The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the Palestinians and Israeli@@ s are caught up in the regional turmoil .
Maybe this will make their struggle bloo@@ dier than before .
However , there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stal@@ e@@ m@@ ate .
A war that is neither lost or won
At first sight , optimism looks very hard to justify now .
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds , this week 's fighting has strengthened the haw@@ ks on both sides .
The leaders of Hamas , the Islam@@ ist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will claim to have forced the Israeli@@ s to back off , even though Gaza has taken a dru@@ bbing .
Despite killing some of its leaders and bott@@ ling up Gaza 's 1@@ .@@ 7m people in one of the most wret@@ ched and crowded c@@ o@@ r@@ ners of the planet , Israel has failed to destroy Hamas .
Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank , the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah , the more moderate Palestinian faction .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , Hamas 's leaders may well conclu@@ de that time is on their side .
As Islam@@ ists across the Arab world have gained clout , so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends .
Turkey , a resurgent regional power that was once Israel 's closest Muslim ally , has taken up Hamas 's cause ; so has Qatar , one of the rich@@ est and most dynamic of the Gulf states .
J@@ u@@ bil@@ ant Hamas people say an Islam@@ ist c@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ cent is c@@ u@@ r@@ ving around Israel , from Lebanon in the north , where the Hiz@@ bul@@ lah p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y@@ -@@ c@@ u@@ m@@ -@@ militia holds s@@ way , through Syria , where rebels of an increasingly Islam@@ ist bent may top@@ ple Bash@@ ar Assad , and on down through Jordan , where Hamas 's allies are m@@ e@@ n@@ acing the king .
Above all , on Israel 's southern flank , the rise of the Muslim B@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ hood under President Muhammad Mor@@ si in Egypt , by far the most p@@ o@@ p@@ u@@ l@@ ous and pivotal of Arab countries , has changed the region 's balance .
Hos@@ ni M@@ u@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ak , the secul@@ ar d@@ e@@ s@@ pot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his down@@ fall in 2011 , had little time for Hamas .
By contrast , the B@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ hood is a cousin of Hamas , and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion .
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America .
Meanwhile , Israel 's hard@@ liners will draw the opposite conclusions .
In military terms , Hamas has been put back in its box .
Israel 's Ir@@ on Dome anti-@@ missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas 's missiles have been destroyed .
Israeli@@ s will sleep more s@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ dly - for a while .
In diplomatic terms , America is as s@@ t@@ e@@ a@@ d@@ fast as ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
Above all , Israel has prosper@@ ed , especially under Bin@@ y@@ a@@ m@@ in Net@@ a@@ n@@ y@@ a@@ h@@ u , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
Although roc@@ kets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israeli@@ s since 2004 , Israel has been fairly free of s@@ u@@ i@@ c@@ i@@ de-@@ bombers , thanks in part to the barrier that b@@ ites into the West Bank , the main chun@@ k of a would-be Palestinian state , and protects the Jewish sett@@ l@@ ements that continue to expand despite their i@@ l@@ l@@ e@@ g@@ ality in international law .
Mr Net@@ a@@ n@@ y@@ a@@ h@@ u , whose L@@ i@@ k@@ ud party has m@@ e@@ r@@ ged with an even more haw@@ k@@ ish lot under A@@ v@@ i@@ g@@ d@@ or Lie@@ b@@ e@@ r@@ man in the run-up to an election on January 22nd , is sitting pretty .
Why c@@ o@@ d@@ dle those t@@ w@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ y Palestinians by giving them a state of their own ?
If they really ran the West Bank , would they not fire roc@@ kets , just as their compatri@@ ots have done in Gaza ?
Bet@@ ter to keep them behind that wall and s@@ m@@ ite them if they raise their heads .
Maybe the hard@@ liners will win out ; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations .
Even if the Islam@@ ists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
Israel 's defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined .
Starting a war with the local super@@ power will hardly help the new Arab governments m@@ end their economies .
That the pragmati@@ c Mr Mor@@ si worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire a@@ u@@ g@@ u@@ r@@ s well - and might just mark the start of something .
Israeli@@ s too should look to the longer term .
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depriv@@ ing Palestinians of their right to self-@@ determination is creating a powder k@@ e@@ g that is bound one day to e@@ x@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ de in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week .
R@@ e@@ p@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ sion is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state , and d@@ e@@ m@@ o@@ graph@@ y exacer@@ b@@ ates this as the Arab population s@@ w@@ ells .
Bloo@@ dy missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll .
Both sides need p@@ r@@ o@@ d@@ ding by outsiders
The answer remains the one trum@@ p@@ e@@ ted by sensible people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with Israel ced@@ ing territory for security .
The hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause .
Egypt , which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into Gaza , along with Turkey and Qatar , is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land s@@ w@@ aps and a shared Jerusalem .
Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together .
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ hood at the UN .
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table .
During his first term , he neg@@ l@@ e@@ cted to present his own plan for peace .
Back in the White House , he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in .
This is wo@@ efully short-@@ sigh@@ ted .
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East .
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians .
C@@ i@@ g@@ a@@ r@@ ette plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
S@@ m@@ o@@ king warnings and d@@ i@@ s@@ eased body parts e@@ m@@ b@@ l@@ a@@ z@@ oned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia 's world-@@ first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand logos and colours with gener@@ ic dra@@ b olive green coverings , g@@ r@@ u@@ e@@ s@@ ome pictures of d@@ i@@ s@@ eased body parts and depic@@ tions of children and babies made ill by their parents ' smoking .
Apart from the varying health warnings and images the only difference between the packs , mandatory from Saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small f@@ o@@ n@@ t .
It is the world 's most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .
Australia 's federal government says the aim is to d@@ e@@ ter young people from smoking by stri@@ pping the habit of glamour .
It is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
" Even from a very early age you can see that kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their branding , " said the federal health minister , Tanya P@@ liber@@ s@@ e@@ k , citing studies that showed , for example , children linking a crown in a logo with the idea of being a p@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ ess .
While Australia has one of the world 's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on m@@ u@@ l@@ tin@@ ation@@ als ' profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
The tobacco industry l@@ o@@ b@@ b@@ i@@ ed hard against the laws .
Tob@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o firms said they would boost black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigarettes .
" There will be serious u@@ n@@ intended consequences from the legislation , " said Scott M@@ c@@ I@@ n@@ ty@@ re of British American Tob@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o Australia .
C@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ f@@ e@@ i@@ t@@ ers from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia .
Others say the laws have boosted their business .
Sandra H@@ a of Z@@ ico Im@@ port P@@ ty Ltd , a small family business , said demand for cigarette cases , s@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ on covers to mas@@ k the u@@ n@@ pal@@ a@@ t@@ able pack@@ ages , had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tob@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o , Britain 's Im@@ perial Tob@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o , Philip Morris and Japan Tob@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o lost a challenge to the laws in Australia 's high court .
H@@ a said Z@@ ico had sold up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock .
This is good business for us .
The potential h@@ i@@ t@@ ch , experts say , is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targeting .
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view , tobacco marketing has moved online .
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites .
" If you are a tobacco m@@ a@@ r@@ k@@ eter and you 've only got this small window left to promote your products , online is the compelling place for you to be in , " said Bec@@ ky Freeman , a public health researcher at Sydney University .
Freeman noted an increase in " average Joe " reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube , Tw@@ itter and Facebook .
We have to ask , is that just a private citiz@@ en who really loves Marl@@ boro cigarettes and they 've gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company involved ?
British American Tob@@ a@@ c@@ c@@ o Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing .
The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine , Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being u@@ n@@ fairly restric@@ ted , despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia .
A WTO ruling is likely in mid-@@ 2@@ 0@@ 13 .
P@@ liber@@ s@@ e@@ k said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging .
Canada was the first country to make photograph warnings mandatory in 2001 .
They now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
Tou@@ g@@ h@@ er laws are being considered in Britain , New Zealand , South Africa and India .
Many smo@@ kers in Australia remain defiant .
The pictures don 't affect me .
I just ignore them .
" You just grab a smoke and put it away , " said Victor El H@@ age as he purchased a pack with a photograph of a mouth tum@@ our .
H@@ o@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ly , there 's only one reason I 'd stop , and that 's my little girl .
James Y@@ u , who runs the King of the Pack t@@ o@@ bac@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ ist in central Sydney , said the uniform packaging made it harder to stack his shelves
" It used to take me an hour to u@@ n@@ load a delivery , now it takes me four hours , " Y@@ u said .
" The government should have just banned them altogether and then we 'd go OK , fine , we 're done , we 'll shut up shop , " he said , throwing his hands up in the air .
In a Const@@ antly P@@ l@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ed-@@ In World , It 's Not All Bad to Be B@@ o@@ red
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
I won 't lie to you .
Half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty t@@ e@@ d@@ i@@ ous , even with the d@@ i@@ s@@ tractions of books , magazines and iPhones ( not to mention d@@ u@@ ty-@@ free shopping ) .
But increasingly , some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
It 's all right for us - and our children - to be b@@ o@@ red on occasion , they say .
It forces the brain to go on interesting t@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ ents , perhaps fostering creativity .
And because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days , we don 't experience the benefits of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
So should we embrace b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom ?
Yes .
And no .
But I 'll get back to that .
First of all , like many people , I assum@@ ed that b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the advent of more leisure time .
Not so , says Peter Too@@ hey , a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Cal@@ gary in Canada and the author of " B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom : A Liv@@ ely History " ( Yale University Press , 2011 ) .
" B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom actually has a very long history , " he said .
There 's Latin graff@@ iti about b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom on the walls of Pom@@ p@@ e@@ ii dating from the first century .
Then there 's the question of how we define b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
The trouble is that it has been defined , and discussed , in many different ways , said John D. Eastwood , an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario , Canada .
After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom as an experience of " wanting to , but being unable to engage in satis@@ fying activity . "
What separ@@ ates b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom from a@@ p@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ y , he said , is that the person is not engaged but wants to be .
With a@@ p@@ a@@ t@@ h@@ y , he said , there is no urge to do something .
The core experience of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom , he said , is " d@@ i@@ s@@ r@@ u@@ ption of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . "
B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom can sound an awful lot like depression .
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can be related , people who are b@@ o@@ red tend to see the problem as the environment or the world , while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves .
Sometimes we think we 're b@@ o@@ red when we just have difficulty concentr@@ ating .
In their study , " The U@@ n@@ engaged M@@ i@@ n@@ d : D@@ e@@ f@@ i@@ n@@ ing B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom in Ter@@ ms of Attention , " which appeared in the journal P@@ e@@ r@@ spec@@ tives on Psych@@ ological Science in September , Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier exper@@ iment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room , others heard it at a low level so it was barely notic@@ eable , while the third group didn 't hear the soundtrack at all .
The ones who heard the low-@@ level TV reported more b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentr@@ ating but were not sure why , and attributed that difficulty to b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
When you 're trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task , d@@ i@@ s@@ r@@ u@@ ption of attention can lead to b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom , said Mark J. F@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ ke , an associate professor of neur@@ o@@ science at the University of G@@ u@@ e@@ l@@ ph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study .
On the other hand , when you 're doing something dull , " such as looking for bad wid@@ gets on a factory line , d@@ i@@ s@@ trac@@ ting music can help you not be b@@ o@@ red . "
In fact , he said , we now know that squ@@ i@@ r@@ ming and d@@ o@@ o@@ dling , often seen as a sign of b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert .
" Research shows that kids who are allowed to fid@@ get learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , " Professor F@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ ke said .
We all experience b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom at some points - my flight delay , a d@@ r@@ oning speaker , a particularly t@@ e@@ d@@ i@@ ous movie .
But some individuals are more likely to be b@@ o@@ red than others .
To help measure this , researchers developed a " B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom P@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ eness Sc@@ ale " in the 1980s .
The scale includes questions like , " Many things I have to do are repeti@@ tive and m@@ o@@ n@@ o@@ t@@ onous , " and " I have so many interests , I don 't have time to do everything . "
Using such s@@ c@@ ales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be b@@ o@@ red more often than girls , said Stephen Vo@@ d@@ a@@ n@@ ov@@ ich , a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida , especially when it comes needing more , and a variety of , external stimul@@ ation .
But in general , teenagers are a pretty j@@ a@@ d@@ ed lot .
In 1991 , Reed Larson , a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois , conducted an exper@@ iment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by b@@ e@@ eper .
He found that 32 percent of a@@ d@@ o@@ l@@ e@@ s@@ cents said they were b@@ o@@ red in school and doing home@@ work , while 23 percent said they were b@@ o@@ red when they weren 't in school .
On the other hand , 3 percent of parents said they were b@@ o@@ red .
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom p@@ e@@ r@@ c@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ages now , 21 years later , would be higher or lower .
But he said he did know that " a@@ d@@ o@@ l@@ escence is a peak period for b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom , " largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
So back to my original question : Is b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom good for you ?
Sometimes no , because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks , gam@@ ble or i@@ n@@ d@@ u@@ l@@ ge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
On the other hand , many phil@@ os@@ oph@@ ers and writers discuss the connection between b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom and creativity , said Professor Vo@@ d@@ a@@ n@@ ov@@ ich , who has been studying the issue for more than two decades .
" B@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom is the brain 's way to tell you you should be doing something else , " said Gary Marcus , a professor of psychology at N.@@ Y@@ .@@ U .
But the brain doesn 't always know the most appropriate thing to do .
If you 're b@@ o@@ red and use that energy to play guitar and cook , it will make you happy .
But if you watch TV , it may make you happy in the short term , but not in the long term .
So if your child is b@@ o@@ red and you give him an i@@ Pad , he may not be b@@ o@@ red anymore , but he hasn 't learned how to e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ ain himself , or self regulate , Professor F@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ ke said .
And " that self-@@ regulation transfers from one situation to other , " he said .
Your kid doesn 't just learn to e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ ain himself , but gets more self-@@ control in other areas .
I don 't think we really want to celebrate b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom .
Nor should we be too critical of it .
Rather , our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chat@@ ter of activity and technology .
Professor Eastwood agreed .
" We frame it as we need to be b@@ o@@ red more , but b@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ dom is an a@@ g@@ onizing , r@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ less desire to be connected with something meaningful , " he said .
What people are really searching for , he said , is a way to u@@ n@@ plug and enjoy down time .
" In an environment where we are const@@ antly o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ stimul@@ ated , " he said , " it 's hard to find ways to engage when the noise s@@ h@@ u@@ ts down . "
In Colorado , No P@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ book for New Mari@@ juana Law
Anthony Oro@@ zco , 19 , a community college student and socc@@ er player in southeastern Colorado , is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few n@@ u@@ g@@ gets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
Mr. Oro@@ zco said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lamar , on the plains near the Kansas border , when they were pulled over .
After the police officer found marijuana in the car , Mr. Oro@@ zco was issued a s@@ u@@ m@@ m@@ ons for possession and drug p@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ her@@ n@@ alia - petty offenses that each carry a $ 100 fine - and given a court date .
" We get treated like criminals , " Mr. Oro@@ zco said .
But is he one ?
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado 's vote to l@@ e@@ g@@ alize small amounts of marijuana for r@@ e@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ ational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location .
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State , which approved a similar measure .
Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small-@@ scale possession that will be legally s@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ tioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
But prosecutors in more conservative precin@@ c@@ ts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession .
At the same time , several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new , state-@@ licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities .
" This thing is evolving so quickly that I don 't know what 's going to happen next , " said Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in Aur@@ ora , just east of Denver .
Reg@@ u@@ l@@ ators in Washington State are also scrat@@ ching their heads .
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec. 1 , 2@@ 0@@ 13 .
They say that Colorado , for better or worse , is ahead of most states in regul@@ ating marijuana , first for medical use and now r@@ e@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ ation@@ ally .
" Colorado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , " said Brian E. Smith , a spokesman for the Washington State L@@ i@@ q@@ u@@ or Control Board .
But no place or system , Mr. Smith conceded , can do more than suggest what might work .
" There 's no real preced@@ ent for us to follow , " he said .
Washington 's law , called I@@ -@@ 502 , takes effect on Dec. 6 , which also leaves a year of l@@ i@@ m@@ bo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but l@@ e@@ g@@ alized possession will .
And there are thor@@ ny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state 's mand@@ ate of " adequate access " to licensed marijuana with its prohi@@ bitions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , p@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ ground or child care center .
" Nowhere will it be more difficult to site a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas , particularly in the Seattle m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ politan area , " said Ben Liv@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ s@@ t@@ on , a spokesman for the Center for Legal C@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ a@@ b@@ is , a recently formed research group .
On Nov. 21 , Chief O@@ ates in Aur@@ ora sent his officers an e-mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecu@@ ting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes " effective immediately . "
Chief O@@ ates said that the police would enforce city c@@ o@@ des regul@@ ating medical marijuana growers , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers .
In northern Colorado 's Weld County , the district attorney , Ken B@@ uck , represents a stric@@ ter view .
After the vote , he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
Right now , 1@@ 19 people face charges of poss@@ essing two ounces or less of marijuana , though many are facing other charges .
" Our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were crimes at the time they occurred , " Mr. B@@ uck said in a statement .
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mes@@ a County , where voters rejected the marijuana initiative .
The police in Grand Jun@@ ction , the county 's largest city , are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts .
The county 's district attorney , Pete H@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ zinger , supported that decision , but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases .
" I do not think I 'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes , " he said .
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure , bringing r@@ e@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ ational marijuana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
And the contradic@@ tory reactions across the state lay bare a deep a@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ v@@ a@@ l@@ ence among local officials about the state 's big green exper@@ iment .
" It 's a cultural barrier " with district attorneys , said Sean M@@ c@@ Alli@@ ster , a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Mari@@ juana La@@ ws .
" They spent so much of their lives prosecu@@ ting people that they still don 't really accept that this is legal , " he said .
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug l@@ e@@ g@@ alization .
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of l@@ e@@ g@@ alized sales , they are also a@@ n@@ x@@ i@@ ously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultiv@@ ation of marijuana as federal crimes .
Advoc@@ ates for l@@ e@@ g@@ alized marijuana are hoping the Justice Department yi@@ elds .
Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers , the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado , Washington and 16 other states .
While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug , they are likely to b@@ a@@ l@@ k at allowing the state-@@ regulated r@@ e@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ ational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws , said Kevin A. Sab@@ et , a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration .
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
Even before E@@ l@@ e@@ ction Day , some local governments approved m@@ o@@ r@@ a@@ t@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ ums on any new marijuana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can open .
Last week , the western city of M@@ o@@ n@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ se took up a six-@@ month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
" We don 't want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue , " said Bob N@@ i@@ c@@ h@@ o@@ l@@ son , a City Council member .
Our community voted against this amend@@ ment .
We 're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for .
There 's an awful lot of questions .
Petron@@ e@@ l@@ la Wyatt : I was bul@@ lied out of Oxford for being a Tory
It is not just today 's university students who are attacked for their views
I can 't remember a time when I didn 't dream of winning a place at Oxford University .
Both my father and my elder brother had been at what I imagined was the world 's greatest seat of learning , a modern@@ -day w@@ i@@ n@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ l@@ ush@@ ed Greek sym@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ i@@ um encouraging the dual p@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ ars of c@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ lisation , free thinking and tol@@ erance .
Yet , within two weeks of taking up my place at W@@ o@@ r@@ c@@ e@@ s@@ ter College in the late E@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ ties to read history , I 'd packed my bags , precip@@ itating the first scandal of my life .
My father broke down and cried .
Friends were b@@ a@@ f@@ f@@ led .
The Even@@ ing Standard diary claimed I 'd quit because I objected to fellow u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ graduates having sex in the room next to mine .
The writer A N Wilson announced w@@ agg@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ ly that I 'd depar@@ ted because I was forced to drink out of c@@ h@@ i@@ pped mugs .
The truth was less droll .
I ran away .
Yes , ran , because I had been subject to s@@ y@@ s@@ t@@ ematic bullying and intimid@@ ation .
Not on account of my rather o@@ u@@ t@@ r@@ é name , or the fact that I came from a private school .
I was persecu@@ ted for one reason only , and in this c@@ r@@ a@@ d@@ le of supposed enligh@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ ment it was both big@@ oted and b@@ a@@ r@@ b@@ a@@ r@@ ic : my father , the late Woo@@ d@@ r@@ o@@ w Wyatt , was a high-profile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter .
Why bring this up now , you might ask .
Well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of R@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ -@@ of-@@ centre students are suffering a similar persecu@@ tion .
Such is the institu@@ t@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ alised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same e@@ q@@ u@@ a@@ l@@ -@@ rights protection as gays , d@@ i@@ s@@ a@@ b@@ led people and ethnic minorities .
Conservative members of C@@ o@@ r@@ p@@ us C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ i College 's junior common room ( J@@ CR ) claim they are " often actively isol@@ ated , personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome " because of their political views .
They want to create a post on the college 's equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely .
Their situation wasn 't helped by a recent BBC Two documentary , Won@@ derland : Young , Bright and on the Right , about student politics , which portr@@ ayed Tor@@ ies as od@@ d@@ balls and neo-@@ Naz@@ is .
It featured graduate Joe Coo@@ ke , former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association ( O@@ U@@ CA ) , travelling in a Roll@@ s@@ -@@ Roy@@ ce , sporting a silver suit and sil@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ -@@ top@@ ped cane .
At other universities , Conservative students say they are being treated as " s@@ c@@ ape@@ goats " for the introduction of higher tuition fees . "
Luke Black , 20 , vice-president of Nottingham University Conservative Association , told a Sunday newspaper that " there is a growing L@@ e@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ wing bias at universities .
People assume we are like the Bull@@ i@@ n@@ g@@ don Club without meeting us . "
Samuel Roberts , 21 , a history student at C@@ o@@ r@@ p@@ us C@@ h@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ i , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is " uncomfortable , " while Stephanie C@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ ill , 19 , president elect of O@@ U@@ CA , says there has been a deteri@@ oration in the attitude of J@@ CR members towards people who are Right of centre .
" This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of members , " she says .
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford .
I had gone up in September 1986 , a crip@@ p@@ l@@ ingly shy 18-year-old .
Hat@@ red of the Conservative Party was at its most f@@ e@@ b@@ r@@ i@@ le .
The year before , the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an hon@@ o@@ r@@ ary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
The atmosphere would have made a S@@ t@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ n@@ ist s@@ h@@ u@@ d@@ der with appreh@@ ension .
During the first few days of f@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ h@@ ers " week , when new students s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ alise with each other and the d@@ ons , I had a taste of the w@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ wood that was to come .
I was to find that the d@@ ons not only c@@ o@@ n@@ n@@ i@@ ved in the t@@ a@@ u@@ n@@ ting of Tory u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ graduates but took part with relish .
The politics of the miners " strike , p@@ r@@ i@@ v@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ s@@ ation and the government 's opposition to sanctions against a@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ id South Africa were brought into the w@@ o@@ o@@ d@@ -@@ pan@@ elled rooms of the t@@ u@@ torial .
My first one involved t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ l@@ ating 1@@ 8@@ th-century French tex@@ ts into English , and I was unprepared for what followed .
" Miss Wyatt , " said the don , Harry Pitt ( now dec@@ eased ) , " please t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ late the first paragrap@@ h . "
I stumbled over it .
A small man with a face like cake bat@@ ter , Pitt was big on b@@ i@@ le .
" Do T@@ h@@ a@@ t@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ ites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid ? " he demanded .
The other u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ graduates gig@@ g@@ l@@ ed .
Tears pric@@ ked the back of my eyes .
" I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is , if you 're not too busy s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ ing , " Pitt s@@ nar@@ led .
I walked back to my rooms a d@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ ate figure .
At dinner in college that evening I sat by myself ; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder .
It was a second-@@ year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the O@@ U@@ CA .
" I know who you are , " he said kind@@ ly .
I 'm afraid it 's like that .
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is picked on .
It 's bad enough for me , but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher , so it will be worse for you .
Most Tory f@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ h@@ ers pretend they 're Labour .
Later , at a local pub , I c@@ r@@ a@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ ly attempted to d@@ i@@ s@@ simul@@ ate .
I insisted that I didn 't agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said .
This ploy proved unsuccessful .
A first year PP@@ E student , who , iron@@ ically , had been to E@@ ton , said : " You 're the daughter of a fas@@ c@@ i@@ s@@ t pig . "
You 're contaminated .
Other students took up the refrain .
I was perverted , dirty .
" How do Tor@@ ies have sex ? " one asked .
They beat each other , don 't they ?
I felt the way homo@@ sexu@@ als must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Six@@ ties .
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford ?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark ?
Would I have to turn to Labour and s@@ u@@ p@@ press my natural i@@ n@@ c@@ l@@ i@@ n@@ ations ?
The three years before me s@@ t@@ r@@ e@@ t@@ ched out as a p@@ u@@ r@@ g@@ atory of o@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ ism and isolation .
The only openly Tory don was N@@ o@@ r@@ man Stone , Professor of Moder@@ n History , who was based at my college .
He was h@@ ated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers .
He was hardly ever there .
He loath@@ ed the place as provincial and petty , and for its a@@ d@@ her@@ ence to the M@@ a@@ r@@ x@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ -@@ deter@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ t view of history .
In 1997 he took up a profess@@ orship at the University of Bil@@ k@@ ent , in Ankara , Turkey .
" You won 't be happy here , " he told me .
I began c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ u@@ ting from Oxford to my parents " house in London , finding refuge with my more open-@@ minded m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ politan friends and family .
I told my father I h@@ ated Oxford and why .
He was i@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ d@@ ulous .
During his time there in the F@@ o@@ r@@ ties , all political views had been accepted .
" But it 's the best place in the world , " he said pa@@ thetically .
They wouldn 't do that , not among my d@@ r@@ e@@ aming s@@ p@@ ires .
Even my Communist friends always had impecc@@ able manners .
His r@@ h@@ e@@ u@@ my eyes began to cloud .
Give it a chance .
I 'm sure it 's all just a t@@ e@@ ase .
It would break my heart if you left .
E@@ x@@ h@@ a@@ u@@ sted by my frequent trips to London , my emotional resistance was deteri@@ orating .
A male friend of mine , also a Tory supporter , had succumbed to pressure and r@@ e@@ n@@ ounced his creed .
During a t@@ u@@ torial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in complete seriousness , that I was an " enemy of the people , " I decided to do the same .
I@@ n@@ w@@ a@@ r@@ dly b@@ l@@ ush@@ ing with shame , I admitted to being " b@@ r@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ washed by my parents " and called them " old fools . "
The r@@ e@@ s@@ p@@ ite was short .
It was my father who drove the n@@ ail into the coff@@ in of my Oxford career .
At the time , he wrote two colum@@ ns in the Murdoch press each week .
My door was locked .
I c@@ o@@ w@@ ered inside , and after five minutes , my pur@@ suers gave up .
When they left , I packed a s@@ u@@ i@@ t@@ case and caught the first train to London .
I never went back .
You may call me a sni@@ v@@ elling wim@@ p .
But no 18-year-old should be subject to such intimid@@ ation and v@@ i@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ ol in an educational institution .
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford , which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers , but , to this day , hides behind an ill-@@ deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought .
" Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino prefers eleg@@ ance to notori@@ ety "
On the occasion of the " Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino : Master of C@@ o@@ u@@ t@@ ure , " an exhibition that opened this week in London , ABC speaks with N@@ a@@ t@@ y A@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ cal , Fi@@ ona T@@ h@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ -B@@ o@@ r@@ n@@ e@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ za and other of the Italian designer 's famous clients .
Somer@@ set House , former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England , is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino Gar@@ a@@ v@@ ani exhibition .
During the inauguration of " Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino : Master of C@@ o@@ u@@ t@@ ure , " the designer acknowledged a retro@@ spective a@@ p@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ os@@ is that brings together over 130 c@@ o@@ u@@ ture gowns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years .
" I love this pal@@ ace " he says , in his u@@ n@@ mistak@@ able Italian accent .
This exhibition is the c@@ u@@ l@@ mination of a story whose only p@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ a@@ g@@ onist is " s@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ore " Gar@@ a@@ v@@ ani , although it could not have been written without his distingu@@ ished clients .
Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino has always been fascinated by the rare@@ fied and distant world of the n@@ o@@ bility .
In the first room of the exhibition , open until March 3 , there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aristo@@ c@@ r@@ acy , from Princess S@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ m@@ a@@ h Ag@@ a Khan , Lord S@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ don , Princess Mari@@ e@@ -@@ C@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ al of Gre@@ ece to Margaret of England .
Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino exhi@@ bits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social a@@ s@@ cent from humble c@@ o@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ier in Vo@@ g@@ h@@ era , northern Italy , to ido@@ l of the international jet-@@ set .
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty .
" At least they don 't drop cigarette ends on your magni@@ ficent carpet , like some beautiful pop music celebri@@ ties do , " says B@@ a@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ess Fi@@ ona T@@ h@@ y@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ n@@ -B@@ o@@ r@@ n@@ e@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ za .
In the ' 60s and ' 70s , we both lived in the A@@ l@@ ps and were good friends .
Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino is a spectacular host whose e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ t@@ ains with gener@@ os@@ ity and eleg@@ ance .
" We all loved being invited to his c@@ h@@ a@@ l@@ et in G@@ s@@ t@@ a@@ ad " says " H@@ e@@ ini " T@@ h@@ y@@ ssen 's ex-wife , a close friend of forgotten beauties such as M@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ l@@ la A@@ g@@ n@@ elli and Eu@@ genie Ni@@ arch@@ os .
Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino has always preferred eleg@@ ance to notori@@ ety .
And yet , he is a star .
Val@@ eria Maz@@ za , wearing a Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino .
The Argent@@ ine model Val@@ eria Maz@@ za also recalls the c@@ o@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ier 's charis@@ ma .
Many years ago , after a fashion show in P@@ i@@ azza di Sp@@ a@@ g@@ n@@ a in Rome , we went for dinner at his flat .
There were twenty of us , including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr .
You could see and feel his " spirit " in every detail of the flat and its dec@@ or , the food and the music .
" All the guests were made to feel important and loved " recalls the top model , who started working with him during Hau@@ te C@@ o@@ u@@ t@@ ure Week Paris , in 1995 .
" His designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion " she conclu@@ des .
N@@ o@@ bility parade
Gar@@ a@@ v@@ ani 's life is not a story of obsession , but of well r@@ e@@ c@@ i@@ p@@ r@@ o@@ c@@ ated love .
He loves well-@@ educated people who come from good backgrounds , and they love him .
One of the Somer@@ set House gall@@ eries has been transformed into a glamor@@ ous , six@@ ty-@@ foot long c@@ a@@ t@@ walk which offers a role revers@@ al : visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the c@@ a@@ t@@ walk while looking at a dream " audience " wearing Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino mas@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ pieces , for example , the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with A@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ t@@ le On@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ is , the costume Monica V@@ i@@ t@@ ti wore in " La N@@ o@@ t@@ te " and the w@@ o@@ o@@ l and l@@ e@@ a@@ ther coat that belong@@ ed to E@@ m@@ press Far@@ ah D@@ i@@ ba .
In this crowd of m@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ e@@ q@@ u@@ ins , names stand out such as Si@@ bil@@ la of Lux@@ embourg , Gl@@ oria von T@@ h@@ u@@ r@@ n u@@ n@@ d T@@ ax@@ is , Met@@ t@@ e@@ -@@ M@@ a@@ r@@ it of Norway , Ros@@ a@@ r@@ i@@ o of Bulgaria and Sofia of H@@ abs@@ burg .
N@@ a@@ t@@ y A@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ cal and the designer , in 2006
Many of these clients say your first Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino is like your first love , " impossible to forget . "
I remember it perfectly .
It was a pair of trousers , a shirt , a " g@@ i@@ l@@ et " wai@@ s@@ t@@ coat and jacket from the 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1@@ -@@ 1972 a@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ m@@ n-@@ winter collection .
" It was a gift he gave me " says N@@ a@@ t@@ y A@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ cal , one of the designer 's muses .
" I prefer him to other design@@ ers because of his f@@ e@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ i@@ n@@ ity , his great love of women , and because he enh@@ ances our beauty " added the former Duchess of Fer@@ ia .
I love the colours he uses , they really stand out and " lend themselves " to your face .
Their p@@ r@@ o@@ portions are perfect .
The p@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ ess and fashion advis@@ or Patricia del@@ la Giov@@ a@@ m@@ p@@ a@@ o@@ la d '@@ Aren@@ berg also remembers the first time she wore a Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino .
As a teenager living in Italy , I dreamed of reaching the age when I 'd have the chance to wear one of his evening gowns ...
My time finally came in the late ' 90s .
I bought my first Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cousin , Prince E@@ d@@ o@@ u@@ ard de Lig@@ ne .
It was a red dress , with a f@@ r@@ i@@ l@@ ly s@@ k@@ i@@ r@@ t , draped " c@@ o@@ r@@ s@@ age " and a s@@ t@@ r@@ a@@ p@@ l@@ ess neck@@ line .
" It was a dream come true " says Princess D '@@ Aren@@ berg , the w@@ i@@ dow of R@@ o@@ d@@ r@@ i@@ go d '@@ Aren@@ berg .
" Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino is i@@ n@@ different to fashion , his obsession is tim@@ eless " says this Italian aristo@@ crat who lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
Princess D '@@ Aren@@ berg looks after her c@@ o@@ u@@ t@@ u@@ r@@ ier gowns with " the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress , it 's also the many memories that go with it . "
The " king " of fashion
The " grand finale " of the Somer@@ set House exhibition is Mari@@ e@@ -@@ C@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ al Miller 's wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Gre@@ ece in 1995 .
It took four months ' work and 25 " girls " ( as the designer calls his seam@@ stresses ) to create the p@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ l-@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ r@@ u@@ sted , i@@ v@@ o@@ r@@ y@@ -@@ coloured silk gown with t@@ w@@ e@@ l@@ ve different types of l@@ ace and a train four and a half metres long .
According to journalist S@@ u@@ zy Men@@ kes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century , " the return of high society clients . "
D@@ a@@ z@@ z@@ led for years with the " s@@ a@@ v@@ o@@ ir-@@ ê@@ t@@ r@@ e " of the elite , Val@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ ino is now its finest e@@ x@@ p@@ o@@ n@@ ent .
C@@ a@@ v@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ ere di G@@ r@@ an C@@ r@@ o@@ ce ( the highest-ranking distinction in Italy ) , C@@ a@@ v@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ ere del L@@ a@@ v@@ oro , C@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ ur de L 'Or@@ d@@ re des Arts et des Let@@ t@@ r@@ es , and awarded the Legion of H@@ o@@ n@@ our , Gar@@ a@@ v@@ ani accumul@@ ates as many honours as any of his clients ' h@@ u@@ s@@ bands .
" I 've always been struck by his refin@@ ed and calm manner , and his neat and perfect appearance " acknowledges D '@@ Aren@@ berg .
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the O@@ r@@ say Museum .
He was on the table of C@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ t@@ ess Jacqueline de R@@ i@@ bes , a great friend of mine .
" He was i@@ m@@ m@@ a@@ c@@ ulate , time stands still for him . "
If a p@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ c@@ ess says that ...
The hardest job in the world : the human m@@ u@@ les of K@@ a@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen
For four euros , the Indonesian v@@ o@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ o porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kilos of s@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ h@@ ur along steep stone paths .
There are people for whom work is hell , and others who - l@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ally - work in hell .
This is the case of A@@ n@@ to Wi@@ j@@ aya , one of the 400 miners who make their living taking s@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ h@@ ur from the K@@ a@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen v@@ o@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ o , east of the Indonesian island of Jav@@ a .
To do so , he has to descend every day to the bottom of the crater , where the s@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ h@@ u@@ r@@ ous gas emanating from the bow@@ els of the earth solidi@@ fies on contact with air .
After breaking off large s@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ h@@ ur rocks , which in total can weigh up to 70 kilos , he carries them in two b@@ a@@ m@@ b@@ o@@ o baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths .
It is only 250 metres to the top of the v@@ o@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ o , which rises to 2,3@@ 86 metres above sea level , but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there , at sn@@ ail 's pace , keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid sli@@ pping and falling over the precip@@ ice .
They know that one slip could cost them their lives , as happened to a French tourist who plun@@ ged to her death a few years ago on the haz@@ a@@ r@@ d@@ ous K@@ a@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen c@@ l@@ i@@ ffs .
The K@@ a@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen miners are paid 5 euro cents for each kil@@ o of s@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ h@@ ur removed .
Once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like c@@ i@@ r@@ c@@ us monkeys and then , l@@ u@@ gging their heavy baskets , they walk three kil@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ es to the s@@ c@@ ales installed by a mining company a little further down , 1,8@@ 50 metres above sea level .
This is PT N@@ grim@@ bi Cand@@ i , a company which , since 1@@ 9@@ 60 , has been e@@ x@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ iting the v@@ o@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ o , and quite l@@ i@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ally its workers , whom it pays 6@@ 62 rupees ( 5 euro cents ) per kil@@ o of s@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ h@@ ur .
It then sells the s@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ h@@ ur for 10,000 rupees ( 83 cents ) to the petro@@ chemical industry , as the m@@ i@@ n@@ eral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufac@@ ture of matches , fireworks , cos@@ m@@ e@@ tics , dyn@@ a@@ m@@ ite and even for w@@ h@@ i@@ t@@ ening sugar .
" We generally carry 70 kilos , so we get about 46,000 rupees ( 3.8 euros ) a trip " explains A@@ n@@ to , who usually make three trips a day .
Each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted , but it means he gets 13@@ 8,000 rupees ( 11.@@ 5 euros ) at the end of the day .
Although it seems a pit@@ t@@ ance for such an i@@ n@@ human effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field .
" Miners ' wages are very high here , where@@ as coffee harv@@ esting is paid 15,000 rupees ( 1.2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees ( 167 euros ) " explains the p@@ o@@ r@@ ter , who previously worked as a m@@ a@@ s@@ on in the island resort of Bali .
There , his wage was 75,000 rupees ( 6.@@ 2 euros ) a day and the work was not as hard , but A@@ n@@ to has returned with his family to B@@ a@@ n@@ y@@ u@@ w@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ i , a village near the v@@ o@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ o , for a compelling reason which , in Indonesia , is as overriding as the s@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ h@@ ur : " I married a girl from Bali , where they are Hindu , and I 've brought her to Jav@@ a to convert to Islam . "
A@@ n@@ to has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , c@@ o@@ u@@ ghs const@@ antly and his eyes are i@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ ated by the toxic gases .
At 27 years old , A@@ n@@ to has been risking his life for three years in the K@@ a@@ w@@ ah I@@ jen v@@ o@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ o , and the s@@ u@@ l@@ p@@ h@@ ur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his face with special mas@@ k and g@@ o@@ ggles .
He has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , c@@ o@@ u@@ ghs const@@ antly and his eyes are i@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ ated by the toxic gases from the v@@ o@@ l@@ c@@ a@@ n@@ o .

Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Sing@@ a@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ ans blame their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children .
" Singapore 's population needs to grow . "
I 'm a pa@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ o@@ tic husband , you 're my pa@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ o@@ tic wife , let 's do our c@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ c duty and create life !
It may seem unlikely that these v@@ e@@ r@@ ses are part of an advert for m@@ i@@ n@@ t s@@ w@@ e@@ e@@ ts , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year .
The p@@ h@@ r@@ ases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as " Let 's put a bao ( b@@ un ) in the oven " to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore .
The advertising company that made the video , BB@@ H , is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
Its creative director , Douglas Hamilton , says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their " national duty . "
It 's purely an Internet thing , so we had to make it fun and a@@ m@@ using .
It 's the biggest problem facing this country .
We are the world 's worst at r@@ e@@ producing our own progen@@ y , so we felt it was an issue we had to address .
We knew the Government had tried many things , like launching p@@ e@@ r@@ fum@@ es with p@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ o@@ m@@ ones or o@@ r@@ g@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ s@@ ing speed dating e@@ v@@ enings .
Many of these ideas may have been creative , but they didn 't necessarily work .
So we thought : why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem , by compos@@ ing a rap ?
1.2 children
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so ligh@@ tly .
It spends US@@ D 1,300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to US@@ D 15,000 per child , extends matern@@ ity leave and distribu@@ tes tax benefits .
But this has all had little effect .
Singapore is a rich , high technology city State in Southeast Asia , also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls .
The birth rate in Singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
The last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement rate , was in 1976 .
So why are Sing@@ a@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ ans not having children ?
T@@ an Wei Ming , Director of M@@ a@@ r@@ r@@ i@@ age and Family Policy of the National Pop@@ ulation Division , said that it is a result of " better education " and " a wider range of career opportunities . "
" This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family " he explains .
These changes in social n@@ o@@ r@@ ms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and bir@@ ths , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore .
Meanwhile , an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population .
In Singapore , there are websites where x@@ e@@ n@@ opho@@ bia against many new immigrants is widespread and t@@ h@@ i@@ n@@ ly disgu@@ ised , especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
Incre@@ ased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and l@@ e@@ v@@ i@@ es for foreign workers .
U@@ n@@ expected consequences
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation 's economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in Singapore 's case there are also some unexpected consequences .
The Government is trying not to build so many small houses .
For example , it has started to influence the real estate sector .
Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small a@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ ments , known as " shoe boxes , " which can be built in certain areas of the city .
These a@@ p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ ments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales .
However , there is concern that they may promote a single-@@ living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses .
But , L@@ i@@ m Y@@ ew Soon , managing director of the real estate company E@@ L Develop@@ ers , says his " shoe boxes " sell much faster than larger units .
They are more popular , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
This means they are much better for our cash flow .
However , he admits that the new regulations give cle@@ arer guidance to developers , who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project .
Too stressed
Singapore is a city State .
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate , when talking to Sing@@ a@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ ans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact .
" People are very stressed , houses are expensive and so is education , so a lot of people are putting off having a family " says a young executive .
Other people can have children .
" But , for me , it is important to have my own money and time " says another young man of around 20 years old .
Men and women alike mention their care@@ ers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
So , much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children , when it comes to babies , the Sing@@ a@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ ans have the last word .
What is private o@@ f@@ f@@ line is private online
Priv@@ acy .
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Diction@@ ary , it means the quality of private life or " the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . "
What is privacy for an under 16 ?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks ?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share o@@ f@@ f@@ line ?
E@@ l@@ P@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ ó@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ o interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users .
In four cases , they associated the term with " something very much mine " on a personal level , and " in the user name and p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ word " when applied to social networks .
" I wouldn 't u@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ad my deep@@ est secrets in a post " says Jorge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook , Tw@@ itter , Hot@@ mail and Windows Live Mess@@ enger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
" They are very secret secrets , I 'll tell my mother , but not everybody " he says .
On F@@ B I u@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ad nice pictures or games .
And I have fun with people I know .
" I wouldn 't share a photo that isn 't mine , or that belongs to somebody who 's doing something stupid " he says .
The child recogn@@ ises that it is bad to post o@@ b@@ scene pictures of naked people , crimes , or write h@@ u@@ m@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ ating or aggressive comments .
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on F@@ B and his nine followers on Tw@@ itter .
Most are relatives .
His mother is included , and she has the p@@ a@@ s@@ s@@ word to one of the accounts .
I opened Tw@@ itter to express myself and post interesting t@@ w@@ e@@ e@@ ts .
" I don 't know if they answer me , I only u@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ad them " he adds .
" Social networking is fun , I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends " he says .
He does not hes@@ itate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person .
Nor would he take any notice of someone who recomm@@ ends a stranger to him .
The case of Joseph , aged 14 , is different .
This teenager has accounts with Hot@@ mail , Facebook , My Space and Ask , and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
" It doesn 't bother me , because we have something in common , like music " he says .
The boy says that no-@@ one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number .
" If they pressured me or asked me for it , I 'd just del@@ ete them from my account " he states .
Joseph became a follower on Ask , after reading a recomm@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ation on Tw@@ itter .
This teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyber@@ bullying .
An acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ t@@ ance of a friend of mine was being p@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ed on a social network .
They were threatening him and demanding money from him .
" I never found out who it was " he says .
The victim , according to José , did not close his account .
" He just made it private . "
He then explains a series of steps to c@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ i@@ g@@ ure the account safely .
Unlike Jorge , this boy would u@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ ad photos of acqu@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ tances in uncomfortable or embarr@@ assing situations .
I would do it if I didn 't like somebody , or they made me want to do it .
" However , I know that 's cyber@@ bullying " he admits .
Key questions
Mari@@ e@@ l@@ os Por@@ r@@ as , an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning , believes that to guide children and teenagers , they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform .
" The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game changed " he says .
Por@@ r@@ as says the schol@@ ar Marc P@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ sky , with a Master 's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital N@@ atives , Digital Im@@ migrants , c@@ o@@ ined these terms to explain the phenomenon .
Digital n@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ ves are those children and young people born with technology .
" We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning " he says .
He says that the issue is complex , " because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to d@@ i@@ s@@ close , publish or d@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ l@@ ge , at an age at which matur@@ ity is not conducive to this . "
" They also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends , without thinking of the consequences " he adds .
According to the specialist , the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is , is through questions that make them think .
" T@@ elling them not to do it is no good " he adds .
Por@@ r@@ as then lists some options : There are things you wouldn 't tell a stranger , so why do it online ?
Or , would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend ?
Do you know what others publish about you ?
When t@@ agging party photos , did you ask the other people 's permission to tag them ?
And one more question : does everyone need to know what you 're doing all the time ?
Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do o@@ f@@ f@@ line .
The rules are the same .
" Outside the Internet , people act with respect , m@@ o@@ r@@ ality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks " he says .
Monitoring
Stuart Guard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consultant , says it is essential for parents to read social networks ' policies thor@@ o@@ u@@ g@@ h@@ ly .
By understanding all the clauses , they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account .
" For example , the age at which you are allowed to share or publish " he says .
According to Guar@@ dia , it is important to remind children the " don 't talk to strangers " lesson .
U@@ n@@ a@@ s@@ ur Summit closes without making public the Lim@@ a Declar@@ ation
The Six@@ th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations ( U@@ n@@ a@@ s@@ ur ) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lim@@ a Declar@@ ation , previously announced and theore@@ tically signed by the seven a@@ t@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ e leaders .
E@@ fe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Six@@ th UN@@ A@@ S@@ U@@ R Meeting of Heads of State and Government , but Presidential and C@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvi@@ an Government website .
When asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peruvi@@ an President , Ol@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ a Hum@@ ala , during a brief statement to the press .
J@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ n@@ alists ' access to information from the Summit was restric@@ ted at all times .
During the summit , in the press room , only video was aired , with no sound , showing the presidential meeting with the message " closed session , audio restric@@ ted . "
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press s@@ p@@ o@@ k@@ e@@ s@@ men of some of the UN@@ A@@ S@@ U@@ R governments attending the meeting , but not the Peruvi@@ an Government .
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents , which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media , who asked for more details .
The Peruvi@@ an President then sent an email to the media with the " final statement " of the summit , but this was Hum@@ ala 's statement , and not the official document that closed the summit .
Last October , Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American-@@ Arab Countries ( A@@ S@@ P@@ A ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced Lim@@ a Declar@@ ation was again not made public .
The A@@ S@@ P@@ A official website confir@@ ms that the document was published last Tuesday .
At both international events , the Peruvi@@ an authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists , but limited the o@@ b@@ t@@ a@@ i@@ n@@ ing of information to a maximum .
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the H@@ ague Court to a@@ d@@ j@@ u@@ d@@ i@@ c@@ ate a border dispute between the two countries .
The Presidents of Peru , Ol@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ a Hum@@ ala , and Chile , S@@ e@@ b@@ a@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ á@@ n P@@ i@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ( IC@@ J ) , which on Monday , at The H@@ ague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the lawsuit Lim@@ a has filed against Santiago .
" We will o@@ b@@ e@@ y and execu@@ te the order that currently defin@@ es the differences we are bringing before this international court " said Hum@@ ala , together with his Chilean counterpart .
" Chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of dispu@@ tes , t@@ r@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ es and international courts " added P@@ i@@ ñ@@ era , greeting Hum@@ ala with a handshake , alongside the flags of the two countries .
Confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the IC@@ J came after Colombia this week denounced the B@@ o@@ g@@ o@@ t@@ á P@@ act , where@@ by it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its mari@@ time boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed .
The summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil , D@@ i@@ l@@ ma R@@ o@@ u@@ s@@ s@@ e@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hugo Chavez ; Bolivia , E@@ v@@ o Morales ; and Argentina , Cristina Kirchner .
P@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ u@@ ay , which was suspended by UN@@ A@@ S@@ U@@ R in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando L@@ u@@ go , was not involved in the meeting .
Host President Ol@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ t@@ a Hum@@ ala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in Lim@@ a .
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
Among the resolutions adopted , it was mentioned that UN@@ A@@ S@@ U@@ R countries will take " important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . "
He reported that actions are being implemented to improve " cooperation in the fight against i@@ n@@ security and t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ national organised crime , actions to make medic@@ ation more accessible , low-cost Internet access in all areas of South America , and to deal joint@@ ly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . "
With Europe in crisis , " economic consolidation ( in Latin America ) should not have a triumph@@ alist attitude but should serve to expand its productive m@@ a@@ t@@ r@@ i@@ x and glimpse a better future for its people " Hum@@ ala added .
" We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America , especially in rural and border areas ... u@@ n@@ iting our countries and creating new economic networks " said the Peruvi@@ an President in a message read out .
Among these projects , he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ se ax@@ es of its territory , between the coast and Brazil , and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador , although he gave no further details .
Also , the final document mentioned the political situation in P@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ u@@ ay .
" We hope the electoral process in that country serves to rein@@ corporate it in the Union of South American Nations , " from which it is currently excluded .
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous , peaceful and integrated nation , with good n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ ly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit .
In this sense , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel San@@ tos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua , Daniel O@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ ga , on Saturday in Mexico , to respect@@ fully discuss the mari@@ time dispute after the failure of the IC@@ J , questioned by Bogota .
" The day after tomorrow ( Saturday ) I might have a meeting with President Daniel O@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ ga " San@@ tos said .
" We will review all these paths , [ which ] are not exclusive , and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua " he emph@@ a@@ s@@ ised .
" With President O@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ ga , I hope I can say that we handle this in the most c@@ i@@ v@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ sed and respect@@ ful manner possible " said San@@ tos .
San@@ tos and O@@ r@@ t@@ e@@ ga are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico , where they expect to attend the inauguration of the country 's new President , E@@ n@@ r@@ i@@ que P@@ e@@ ñ@@ a N@@ i@@ e@@ to .
Also , as part of the summit , the bloc 's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2@@ 0@@ 13 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Brazil , U@@ r@@ u@@ g@@ u@@ ay , Venezuela , Chile , G@@ u@@ y@@ ana , Sur@@ i@@ n@@ am and P@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ u@@ ay make up UN@@ A@@ S@@ U@@ R , although the latter is currently suspended .
Peru has the pro t@@ e@@ m@@ p@@ o@@ r@@ e presidency of the regional bloc .
" South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship " says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador , Rafael Correa , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that " South America , in this case , must learn from Europe . "
Correa , who took part in the E@@ l@@ e@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ h Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ A@@ S@@ U@@ R ) held in Lim@@ a , told Peru 's state television that E@@ u@@ r@@ o@@ p@@ e@@ ans " killed one another in the Second World War " and other conflicts , " but are now prac@@ tically one country . "
To this end , he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UN@@ A@@ S@@ U@@ R .
" We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country , as is already the situation with members of the A@@ n@@ dean Community . However , there are still r@@ e@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ onary sectors that want us to return to the past " he said .
The E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ an President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States ( O@@ A@@ S ) under the premise of reducing the influence of the A@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ o@@ -@@ Sa@@ x@@ on states and taking into account those who have signed the P@@ act of San José on human rights .
Those who speak with authority never commit to anything , where@@ as we South Americans sign everything .
" It is i@@ n@@ compreh@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ i@@ ble that the I@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ -American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding " he said referring to Ecuador giving political asy@@ lum to Wiki@@ L@@ e@@ aks founder Juli@@ an Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge .
Correa said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betr@@ ayed his principles , but has respected his " deep democratic and human rights values . "
He added that , at the time , " he had reasonable suspicion that Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge would be e@@ x@@ trad@@ ited to another country and that his case would not be respected . "
Additionally , he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country , when " Swedish legislation itself dict@@ ates that he can be questioned via vide@@ o@@ conference , which could be done from the E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ an Embassy in London . "
Correa said that there is a risk of deteri@@ oration of Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge 's physical and mental health .
" I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing serious " said the E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ an President .
What there is , is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteri@@ orate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise .
" That would complic@@ ate the health of any person " he added .
Correa said that the solution to the asy@@ lum granted to Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge in June by the E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ an Embassy , in London , through the issue of a s@@ a@@ f@@ e@@ -@@ conduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador , is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprison@@ ment of the Wiki@@ L@@ e@@ aks founder .
We do not negoti@@ ate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing discussions .
" The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , because Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge 's lawyer , Bal@@ t@@ a@@ z@@ ar Gar@@ z@@ on , is handling a series of cases in different European courts " he said .
And he felt that " if Britain says no to the s@@ a@@ f@@ e@@ -@@ conduct pass , it 's over . "
And if Sweden , as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions Mr Ass@@ a@@ n@@ ge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London , or i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ rog@@ ates him via Skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
Correa took the opportunity to reas@@ sert himself as a d@@ e@@ f@@ ender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tol@@ erate is " the medi@@ o@@ c@@ r@@ ity , dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression . "
" The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not e@@ v@@ i@@ l and w@@ icked politicians , but bad journalists depending on profit , black@@ mail and extortion " he said .
In that regard , he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists , " or the bankers or b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ ois and hegem@@ onic countries that domin@@ ate Ecuador " and said that , if re-elected , he will " step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction . "
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on P@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ u@@ ay in UN@@ A@@ S@@ U@@ R , at least until their next elections , arguing that the body " must be firm and not tol@@ erate opportun@@ ism and a coup masked with l@@ e@@ g@@ ality " because this will in fact " destroy the legi@@ tim@@ acy of P@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ u@@ a@@ y@@ an democracy . "
The E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ an President also considered the " perfectly p@@ e@@ r@@ tin@@ ent " desire of his Colombian counterpart , Juan Manuel San@@ tos , to now negoti@@ ate with Nicaragua the mari@@ time boundary between the two countries , after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The H@@ ague , in favour N@@ i@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ u@@ an mari@@ time sovere@@ ignty .
For now that ruling is not being followed .
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one .
Conflic@@ t is inevitable , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
They need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward .
Additionally , he trusted in a sound conclusion to the mari@@ time boundary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that " it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however hard it may be . "
With reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador seeking a third consecutive term , he said he sees that possibility " with much optimism and joy , although at times it is pretty hard . "
Correa said that if he loses the elections in February 2@@ 0@@ 13 , he will retire from public life .
P@@ e@@ r@@ son@@ ally , I 've never been interested in power , but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador , s@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ o@@ -@@ economic poverty can only be c@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ cted by political power .
" My political movement believed that it was me who ensured that p@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ able victory , so we have to accept that responsibility " he said .
If I won , it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life .
If I lose , like@@ wise .
" It 's a decision " he confirmed .
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 's new health treatment in Cuba .
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol@@ á@@ s Mad@@ u@@ r@@ o and he tells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba .
" This does not mean a health r@@ e@@ l@@ apse for President Chavez " he said .
In Lim@@ a today , the E@@ c@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ o@@ r@@ i@@ an Head of State attended the Six@@ th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations ( UN@@ A@@ S@@ U@@ R ) , which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sust@@ ain progress , equality and security .
Deaths caused by AIDS are n@@ o@@ w@@ a@@ d@@ ays due to late d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ction
Fab@@ r@@ i@@ zi@@ o was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result : HIV positive .
" It was like a bomb dropped on me " he says , recalling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make " sof@@ ter , " apparently u@@ n@@ successfully .
The boy hid it from his family .
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 43@@ rd birthday .
He is u@@ n@@ doub@@ tedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the G@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ l@@ aj@@ ara Civil Hospital ( CH@@ G ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several batt@@ les with his health .
Fab@@ r@@ i@@ zi@@ o has lived with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early ' 90s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great deal of stig@@ ma .
Then , even the director of an IM@@ SS [ Mex@@ ican Social Security Institute ] clinic refused to d@@ i@@ s@@ charge him " because he had a cut . "
At that time , having Aids was s@@ y@@ non@@ y@@ m@@ ous with death .
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so with quality of life .
However , many people are still u@@ n@@ aware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc , " exhausted " their immune systems and they are suffering from opportun@@ istic infections .
31 years after of the o@@ n@@ set of AIDS around the world , at least since the first reported cases , " the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal " stated the head of the CH@@ G HIV Unit , J@@ a@@ i@@ me A@@ n@@ dra@@ de Vill@@ a@@ n@@ u@@ e@@ v@@ a , saying that this information was endor@@ sed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal .
Inf@@ ectious disease specialist and expert in HIV / AIDS , A@@ n@@ dra@@ de Vill@@ a@@ n@@ u@@ e@@ v@@ a said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence , but that life expectancy and quality of life dep@@ end on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagno@@ sed , with a higher life expectancy for non-@@ drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD@@ 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD@@ 4 count .
In simple terms , this means that anyone diagno@@ sed HIV positive at 25 years old , under these terms and " as long as they keep it under control , can live with no problems to 75 " said the i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ vie@@ w@@ e@@ e .
To gauge this progress , it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mex@@ i@@ c@@ ans today is 76 years .
Although m@@ o@@ r@@ tali@@ ty has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of Mexico , the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 in 2007 to 4,8@@ 62 in 2011 ( UN@@ AIDS annual report ) , it is also true that since the advent of AIDS , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
In J@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ o alone , only 25@@ 5 people died in 2011 , and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been universal access to a@@ n@@ t@@ i@@ retro@@ viral drugs since 2005 .
- Why are do still deaths occur ?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment .
That 's how I view it , and that 's how it 's been at our hospital .
For at least the last 12 years we 've had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are u@@ n@@ aware of their HIV status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
He gave a compelling s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ stic : " Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportun@@ istic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall m@@ o@@ r@@ tali@@ ty is to make earlier diagno@@ ses and , therefore , offer mass d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ ction tests for everyone who needs them . "
Speci@@ alists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in J@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ o ( CO@@ E@@ S@@ ID@@ A ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as Fab@@ r@@ i@@ zi@@ o , who came to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Ka@@ p@@ o@@ s@@ i sar@@ coma , a c@@ a@@ n@@ cerous tum@@ our that is one of the common complications .
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
Some people think they 're going to die and don 't want to know anything .
" If I 'm going to die , I 'd rather have a b@@ low-@@ out three times a week " they say , but not in my case .
The change was for the better ; I eat well , I exercise , I take my drugs .
To date , his parents are only aware he had cancer .
I live as normal a life as anyone else .
" I work , I take part in a lot of activities , I travel , I have an active but responsible sex life , I take care of myself and the other person " said Fab@@ r@@ i@@ zi@@ o , who agreed to share his i@@ n@@ tim@@ ate secrets with MIL@@ E@@ N@@ IO J@@ AL@@ IS@@ CO , to motiv@@ ate those people with his story who today , in the context of World AIDS Day , are afraid .
They should get tested if they are at r@@ i@@ s@@ k@@ . because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive , the better , and if they have already been diagno@@ sed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being responsible .
This is his message , which summar@@ ises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012 .
C@@ o@@ n@@ d@@ o@@ m@@ s behind the counter .
The gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge , said Ric@@ ardo Sal@@ a@@ z@@ ar , a journalist from G@@ u@@ a@@ d@@ a@@ l@@ aj@@ ara who has taken up the HIV cause .
And the greatest cure is prevention .
In places dedicated to this task " the distribution of condoms has actually increased ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us pac@@ kets of a hundred , and that 's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms " he said .
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers .
" Why do you want them ? " is a common question , asked with sar@@ c@@ a@@ s@@ m and judged according to the values of social workers , c@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ l@@ ors , p@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ acy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex , said the speaker .
It was decided to change such i@@ n@@ efficient allocation , and that condoms should not only be placed behind counters , but that pac@@ kets of one hundred should be found in public toilet dispens@@ ers in places frequ@@ ented by young people .
This is not promoting p@@ r@@ o@@ m@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ u@@ ity .
It is not about paying for their b@@ e@@ ers or m@@ o@@ tel fees , as Governor E@@ m@@ i@@ l@@ i@@ o Gonzalez said , when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration .
" And it 's not about sexuality , but it is best to provide condoms to those already p@@ r@@ a@@ c@@ t@@ i@@ sing sexual activity " he said .
J@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ o key points
There are 13,@@ 4@@ 35 cumul@@ ative cases ( 12,@@ 1@@ 5@@ 8 AIDS and 1,3@@ 17 HIV ) .
The state is 4@@ th in the nation in new and cumul@@ ative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV .
92 % of new infections are through sex , 6 % via the blood@@ stream and 2 % p@@ e@@ r@@ i@@ n@@ a@@ t@@ al .
An estimated 50,000 people may be living with HIV , as for each registered case there are around 4-@@ 5 people who do not know they are positive .
R@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ fied by a United States court of appeal , a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the Vi@@ t@@ r@@ o Group 's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico , the scenario is an o@@ m@@ i@@ n@@ ous preced@@ ent for any national company with offices in the n@@ e@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ b@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ ing country that has s@@ o@@ l@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ cy problems .
It seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mex@@ ican law are not vali@@ d in the land of stars and stri@@ pes , contrary to international conventions .
In practical terms , the endors@@ ement of the judgement delivered on 15 June by Judge H@@ a@@ r@@ lin Hale of the Bank@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ cy Court of the Northern District of Texas , leaves Mex@@ ican firms d@@ e@@ f@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ eless against possible seiz@@ ure of their property outside of Mexico .
However , the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States , claiming three i@@ n@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ i@@ s@@ tencies .
From the start , while the trial judge notes that credit@@ ors should be g@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ n@@ ed by the United States Bank@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ cy C@@ o@@ de , the Court of Ap@@ p@@ e@@ al for the Fif@@ th Circuit , based in New Orleans , states that the main action is the i@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ cy action handled in Mexico .
The first point would involve ignoring international p@@ r@@ o@@ c@@ e@@ d@@ ural cooperation in cases of i@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ cy of companies with t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ s@@ national profiles .
Indeed , the UN M@@ o@@ del Law for International Trade Law U@@ n@@ i@@ formity was created for this purpose , with the American Law Institute p@@ o@@ s@@ i@@ tioned as a@@ r@@ b@@ i@@ t@@ r@@ ator .
S@@ e@@ c@@ o@@ n@@ dly , the judgement e@@ s@@ t@@ abli@@ s@@ h@@ es that without the i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ company vote , with the debts the Vi@@ t@@ r@@ o subsidiaries had with their parent company recogn@@ ised in the critical mass of the i@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ cy , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
However , Mex@@ ican law recogn@@ ises the possibility .
In fact , the Vi@@ t@@ r@@ o case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted .
There are half a dozen examples , including Agre@@ m@@ e@@ x and Commercial Mex@@ icana , whose i@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ company debts were endor@@ sed by the Federal Bank@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ cy Institute .
What is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the Vi@@ t@@ r@@ o credit@@ ors who fought against it in the US courts , nam@@ ely " v@@ u@@ l@@ ture " funds such as A@@ u@@ r@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ os Capital , A@@ u@@ r@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ os C@@ o@@ n@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ g@@ ence , Elli@@ ot International and Liverpool Limited , did not achieve a majority .
The vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37 .
This data is o@@ m@@ i@@ t@@ ted by the Court of Ap@@ p@@ e@@ al .
From another perspective , the latter blames Vi@@ t@@ r@@ o for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States , turning its back on the country .
For now , the Gonzalez S@@ a@@ d@@ a family firm has lodged a motion for r@@ e@@ consideration before the Court of Ap@@ p@@ e@@ al for the vote to reach the p@@ l@@ e@@ n@@ ary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously .
Should this fail , an appeal for review by a higher court , in this case the US Supreme Court , will be filed .
The real problem is that the court by@@ passed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of a@@ m@@ i@@ c@@ us c@@ u@@ r@@ i@@ ae ( " friend of the Court " ) , which details the procedure followed by Vi@@ t@@ r@@ o under the framework of the Commercial I@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ cy Law , noting that the latter discharged itself with a@@ d@@ her@@ ence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chap@@ ter 15 of the Bank@@ r@@ u@@ p@@ t@@ cy Act of the United States .
M@@ o@@ r@@ e@@ over , it should be noted that the country yi@@ e@@ l@@ ded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade , that is the rules set for cross-@@ border i@@ n@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ v@@ e@@ n@@ cy cases , ensuring fair@@ ness for d@@ e@@ b@@ tors and credit@@ ors .
Dou@@ ble w@@ h@@ a@@ m@@ my : Vi@@ t@@ r@@ o hit and country hit .
Balance She@@ et
With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mex@@ icana Airlines against the former owner of the company , G@@ ast@@ ó@@ n Az@@ c@@ á@@ r@@ r@@ a@@ g@@ a A@@ n@@ dra@@ de , who is accused of m@@ i@@ s@@ management , dor@@ m@@ ant for several months , the Air@@ line Pil@@ ots Union Association already found the bott@@ len@@ eck .
The proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Mor@@ i@@ n@@ eau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National B@@ a@@ n@@ king and Securities Commission , which is accused of o@@ b@@ struct@@ ing justice .
The claim is that the super@@ v@@ i@@ s@@ ory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Attorney General 's Office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million p@@ e@@ s@@ os from trust F / 5@@ 89 of Banc@@ o I@@ X@@ E , on behalf of Mex@@ icana de A@@ v@@ i@@ aci@@ ó@@ n .
The resources were apparently c@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ n@@ elled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administr@@ a@@ d@@ ora P@@ r@@ o@@ f@@ e@@ s@@ i@@ onal de Hot@@ e@@ l@@ es .
As you know , Az@@ carr@@ a@@ g@@ a A@@ n@@ dra@@ de is the main shareholder of the P@@ o@@ sad@@ as hotel chain .
Op@@ posing Dr@@ agon Mart
A group of local and foreign e@@ n@@ v@@ i@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ alists , academics , businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dr@@ agon Mart in Canc@@ un .
As you know , we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , selling Chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies .
Previously , C@@ a@@ n@@ a@@ c@@ i@@ n@@ tra had managed to u@@ n@@ ite the governors of the southeast of Mexico to oppose the monum@@ ental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry .
The death of AC@@ TA
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mex@@ ican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-@@ C@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ f@@ e@@ iting Trade Agre@@ ement , known by its acron@@ ym AC@@ TA , according to the Mex@@ ican Institute of Industrial Property , and the matter has already been arch@@ i@@ v@@ ed .
As you know , the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility , d@@ e@@ e@@ m@@ ing it an infr@@ ingement of freedom of expression on social networks .

Hector " H@@ e@@ tin " Reyes : " Basketball has been my life "
Basketball glo@@ b@@ e@@ t@@ r@@ o@@ t@@ ter Hector " H@@ e@@ tin " Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , travelled the world .
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of local basketball history as broad as that of H@@ é@@ ctor " H@@ e@@ tin " Reyes .
Reyes was i@@ m@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ sed in the sport for over 60 years before being c@@ o@@ n@@ fined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke ; he was a minor league player , National Superior Basketball player , B@@ S@@ N representative and manager with the Bay@@ a@@ m@@ ó@@ n V@@ aqu@@ eros or President of the Basketball Federation .
" I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when I was president of the B@@ S@@ N , general manager and f@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ative president of the National Team during the ' 90s , " recalled Reyes during P@@ r@@ i@@ mera Hor@@ a 's visit to his home in Bay@@ a@@ m@@ ó@@ n , where he lives with I@@ s@@ a@@ b@@ el , his loyal wife for over 50 years .
" Basketball has been my life . "
Reyes is not exagger@@ ating when he makes that statement .
The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia den@@ o@@ ting his long career , which goes to prove it .
Bay@@ a@@ m@@ ó@@ n at heart
Of them all , the ones he treasures with the most emo@@ tion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the V@@ aqu@@ eros , from the mid-@@ 50s as a player until 1@@ 9@@ 82 , when he completed 15 years serving as co-@@ agent or agent of the franchise .
" Those were my best years , the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the V@@ aqu@@ eros ' eight championships , since 1967 , either as agent , co-@@ agent or manager .
There were many good years , including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975 .
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981 , Jer@@ ome M@@ i@@ n@@ cy 's debut year in the B@@ S@@ N .
Then " C@@ u@@ c@@ o " Ortiz took over - he was a great manager " said Reyes .
I remember that Gene B@@ a@@ r@@ tow , who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama ( Birmingham ) , said to me ' I 've got a very strong player for you , 6 ' 7 " tall .
Do you want him ? '
And that was the beginning of M@@ i@@ n@@ cy , one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had .
B@@ a@@ r@@ tow then recommended the s@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ p@@ shoo@@ ter Gau@@ s@@ se Raymond , who established resid@@ ency here and was one of our best shoo@@ ters .
I remember him saying that if M@@ i@@ n@@ cy had given Bay@@ a@@ m@@ on one championship , Gau@@ s@@ se would help get another .
The V@@ aqu@@ eros ' championship with Gau@@ s@@ se was enjoyed , but from a distance , because in 1988 he was already becoming a f@@ e@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ ative big@@ shot .
For that time , he preferred to enjoy his own and M@@ i@@ n@@ cy 's accomplishments in the national team .
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre-@@ Olympics in Mexico .
Then came the 1990 World Cup , where we came fourth and it should have been b@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ze , but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Reyes .
Is the 1990 World National Team the best you 've ever seen ?
It 's one of the best , as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics .
However , my favourite was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba , when we won gold and gave the US team a beating , which was quite similar to the time we won b@@ r@@ o@@ n@@ ze at the World Cup .
That team not only again included M@@ i@@ n@@ cy , Gau@@ s@@ se , Ram@@ on Riv@@ as , F@@ ico L@@ ó@@ p@@ e@@ z and ' P@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ ín ' ( Ortiz ) , but also the young ( Javier ) ' T@@ o@@ ñ@@ i@@ t@@ o ' C@@ o@@ l@@ ó@@ n and James Carter , the Leon brothers ( Francisco and Edgar ) and Mario ' Q@@ u@@ i@@ j@@ o@@ te ' Morales , who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury .
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a gold medal and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 Pre-@@ Olympic team in Neu@@ q@@ u@@ en , Argentina .
With role players such as ' C@@ a@@ n@@ i@@ t@@ o ' Ni@@ e@@ v@@ es , P@@ a@@ b@@ l@@ o A@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ e@@ a and the young R@@ o@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ o H@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ r@@ u@@ i@@ t@@ i@@ n@@ er replacing the players suspended after the shambles of the Mar del Plat@@ a P@@ an-American Games , we won gold against all the odds .
Who was the best Puerto Rican player ?
Without any doubt , P@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ ín Ortiz .
His numbers at international tournament level are a@@ w@@ e@@ s@@ ome .
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like P@@ i@@ c@@ u@@ l@@ ín did .
Not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in .
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager ?
That 's a difficult one .
We had a very good team , including Julio Tor@@ o , F@@ l@@ or Mel@@ e@@ n@@ dez , Carlos Morales , Raymond D@@ a@@ l@@ m@@ au , A@@ r@@ mand@@ i@@ t@@ o Torres .
Of the youngsters , I really like the work of L@@ e@@ o A@@ r@@ ill .
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation ?
Having been part of the National Team 's most glori@@ ous era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the B@@ S@@ N had up to 17 teams in a season .
What was there left for you to do ?
There were things I 'd have liked to implement , such as r@@ e@@ g@@ i@@ o@@ n@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ ing the minor leagues .
For example , the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs .
Right now the kids are riding and playing too much , u@@ n@@ necessarily .
At least I see the fruit of compul@@ sory certi@@ fications and a course for leaders , table officials and refer@@ ees .
That p@@ l@@ e@@ ases me .
What are you doing now ?
The most I do is listen to music , watch music videos from my era on YouTube , enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games .
And of course , enjoy the company of my wife , Elizabeth , who has always been with me .
Actor Larry Hag@@ man dies
Larry Hag@@ man , born on 21 September 1@@ 9@@ 31 in Fort Worth ( Texas ) , became world famous for his role as John Ross E@@ wing , better known as " J@@ R , " in the television series " Dallas , " in which he played a ruthless , malicious and manipulative business@@ man .
Larry Hag@@ man , whose role as oil tycoon predator J@@ R E@@ wing in the television series " Dallas " became a symbol of greed in the 1980s , has died .
He was 81 .
Hag@@ man , who returned this year as J@@ R in a new season of " Dallas , " died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications , according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by the Warner Bros. , producer of " Dallas . "
" Larry was back in his bel@@ oved hometown of Dallas , once again representing the iconic role he most liked " the family said .
Larry 's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday .
Linda Gray , who played his wife in the original series and the sequel , was with Hag@@ man when he died in a hospital in Dallas , said her publicis@@ t , Jeffrey Lane .
He brought joy to all who knew him .
He was creative , gener@@ ous , funny , loving and talented , and I will miss him d@@ e@@ arly .
" He was an original guy and lived life to the full " said Gray in a statement .
Hag@@ man was diagno@@ sed with c@@ i@@ r@@ r@@ h@@ o@@ sis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drun@@ k a lot over the years .
In 1995 a m@@ a@@ l@@ i@@ g@@ n@@ ant tum@@ our as found in his liver and he underwent a transplant .
Years before " Dallas , " Hag@@ man became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy " I Dream of Jean@@ nie , " aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970 .
He played Cap@@ tain Tony Nelson , an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie , played by Barbara E@@ den , and takes her home to live with him .
He also starred in two s@@ i@@ t@@ c@@ o@@ m@@ s that were not aired for long , " The Good Life " ( NBC , 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ 1@@ -@@ 72 ) and " Here We Go Again " ( ABC , 1973 ) .
His film work included roles well received by critics in " The Group , " " Harry and T@@ onto " and " Primar@@ y C@@ o@@ l@@ ors . "
But it was his mas@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ ful interpretation of deli@@ g@@ h@@ t@@ fully d@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ able J@@ R that led to Hag@@ man reaching his peak of s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ dom .
The drama series on CBS about the E@@ wing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1@@ 9@@ 78 to May 1991 .
The t@@ a@@ g@@ line " Who shot J@@ R ? , " designed to generate hy@@ pe around an episode full of emo@@ tions in which Hag@@ man 's character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wag@@ ered in gaming e@@ s@@ t@@ abli@@ s@@ h@@ ments .
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time .
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980 , an average of 41 million viewers tun@@ ed in and made " Dallas " the second most watched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of " M@@ A@@ S@@ H " in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers .
It was J@@ R 's s@@ i@@ s@@ ter-@@ in-law Kris@@ tin ( played by Mary Crosby ) who shot him .
J@@ R got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a p@@ r@@ o@@ s@@ t@@ i@@ t@@ u@@ te unless she left town , but there were others who also had reasons to attack him .
Hag@@ man portr@@ ayed E@@ wing as a corrupt ins@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ able man with a charis@@ matic smile : a d@@ i@@ s@@ honest entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoho@@ lic wife , Sue Ellen ( Linda Gray ) , sec@@ tioned .
" I know what I want on J@@ R 's tomb@@ stone " Hag@@ man said in 1988 .
It should read : " Here lies the honest citiz@@ en J@@ R E@@ wing . "
This is the only deal he lost .
Victori@@ a Princip@@ al , co-star of the original series , recalled Hag@@ man on Friday as someone " huge , on and off screen . "
He is u@@ n@@ f@@ o@@ r@@ get@@ table and i@@ r@@ r@@ e@@ p@@ l@@ a@@ c@@ eable , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him .
Ten episodes of the new edition of " Dallas " were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT .
He had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain reported .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after , there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of Hag@@ man .
Hag@@ man , born in Fort Worth , Texas , was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin , who starred in class@@ ics such as " South Pacific " and " Peter Pan . "
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1@@ 9@@ 31 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hag@@ man .
He tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early ' 50s , and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1@@ 9@@ 56 , in England .
While there , he met the young Swedish designer M@@ a@@ j Axel@@ sson and married her .
The couple had two sons , Prest@@ on and Heidi , and lived for a long time in the Californian city Malibu , home to many celebri@@ ties .
In 2001 , he called his mem@@ oirs " Hello Dar@@ lin ' : T@@ all ( and A@@ b@@ s@@ o@@ l@@ u@@ t@@ ely True ) Tales About My Life . "
" I didn 't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way " he told Associated Press at the time .
After his liver transplant , he became an organ d@@ o@@ n@@ ation promo@@ ter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital , helping fear@@ ful patients .
" I advis@@ e them , encourage them , meet with them when they come for their surgery , and afterwards " he said in 1996 .
I try to offer some comfort , such as " Don 't be afraid , it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time , but then you 'll be fine . "
He was also an anti-@@ smoking activist and took part in several campaigns .
Start of a course that expl@@ ores the " End of the World "
Each week , students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ es , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
This term , when Professor of religion , Stuart C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ é , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a compelling hook : The end of the " long c@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ t@@ down " of the May@@ an calendar , 21 December , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming .
But C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ é had no idea what awai@@ ted him over the next couple of months : The cataclys@@ mic hurricane Sandy , a fiscal precip@@ ice some called " debt A@@ r@@ m@@ a@@ g@@ e@@ d@@ don " and a growing conflict involving Israel , where e@@ n@@ d@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ world Christians t@@ h@@ e@@ o@@ r@@ ists think the A@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ p@@ se will begin .
" I didn 't r@@ e@@ alise this was going to be the most apocalyptic term ever " said C@@ h@@ a@@ r@@ m@@ é this week to students at Rut@@ ger@@ s@@ -@@ Cam@@ den University ( New Jersey ) .
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality .
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the " end of the world " this term , theore@@ tically the last in history .
At Temple , Associate Professor Barry V@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ er is giving the course " Media , Culture and the end of the world . "
Each week , students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war , z@@ o@@ m@@ b@@ i@@ es , viruses and ger@@ ms , and global warming .
" We looked at why these ideas p@@ r@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ f@@ e@@ r@@ ate over time " he said , and how they offer hypo@@ thetical scen@@ arios that guide human behaviour .
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
This month students analy@@ sed movies with an apocalyptic theme and explored how they compare with real-life examples .
" I 've tried to inform students about what is possible , p@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ able , credible and impossible " said V@@ a@@ c@@ k@@ er .
At the main Pennsylvania State University campus , Latin American History Professor Matthew Rest@@ all , and his colleague Amar@@ a Sol@@ ari , an Associate Art History and A@@ n@@ thro@@ pology Professor , have t@@ e@@ amed up to give a course , called simply " The end of the world . "
" We don 't add ' 2012 ' so we always have the option of running the course again , if the world doesn 't come to an end " said Rest@@ all .
Despite the " impending doom , " students have to study , u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ take projects and take final e@@ x@@ ams .
At Penn State , the final exam will be taken on the eve of the A@@ p@@ o@@ c@@ a@@ l@@ y@@ p@@ se , which leaves students no choice but to work " until the very night the world is supposed to end " said Rest@@ all .
The courses proved quite popular .
" It was fully booked within two hours " said Rest@@ all , on his course for students with high a@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ ages , which was filled with 35 students .
We received e@@ m@@ ails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places .
Students , meanwhile , say the course is one of the most interesting around .
" I find it fas@@ c@@ i@@ n@@ ating to see what people do to console themselves " said B@@ r@@ i@@ d@@ g@@ i@@ d Robinson , a 23-year-old post-@@ graduate Religion and S@@ o@@ c@@ i@@ ology student from H@@ a@@ d@@ d@@ o@@ n@@ field , New Jersey , at Rut@@ ger@@ s@@ -@@ Cam@@ den .
And the apocalyptic , secul@@ ar or religious mentality is just a matter consolation or a lack of it .
Will W@@ e@@ k@@ esa , a 25-year-old post-@@ graduate Psych@@ ology and Nur@@ sing student , said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies .
" I 'd never heard of a class that could teach it " he said .
I enjoy it .
But none of the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st .
" Our first project was about the May@@ an prop@@ h@@ e@@ cy and to a certain extent we d@@ i@@ s@@ c@@ r@@ e@@ d@@ ited it " said Julie Z@@ e@@ g@@ l@@ en , a 21-year-old final year student at Temple , from West Chester .
The May@@ ans never predicted the end of the world : it is just a key point in the calendar , said Rest@@ all .
But he said that Western culture suffers from apocalyptic anxiety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes around them by predic@@ ting the end of the world .
The Internet has caused a boom in these specul@@ ations .
" In other places , people don 't think about it " he said .
It 's mostly in the Eng@@ l@@ i@@ s@@ h@@ -@@ speaking world .
Joseph Dou@@ g@@ h@@ e@@ r@@ ty , a Professor of religion at La Sal@@ le University , who is giving courses in the Philippines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the " end of the world " there .
" The Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world " he wrote , suggesting an exception of a higher authority .
We have an i@@ n@@ d@@ u@@ l@@ g@@ ence from the Pope .
Rest@@ all noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement , and said that if nothing happens on December 21st , " people will immediately start thinking of the next date " or phil@@ os@@ o@@ p@@ h@@ i@@ s@@ ing that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-@@ year period after which the world will end .
Students and teachers are taking the date ligh@@ tly .
Some said they plan to go to " end of the world " parties .
" Maybe I 'll call some friends so we can have a laugh together " said Sam@@ ira Ford , 2@@ 0@@ -year-old communications student .
