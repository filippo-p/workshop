<seg id="1">Is there finally some relief from annoying robocalls?</seg>
<seg id="2">For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is too often a waste of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">His Sports City Pizza Pub in Buffalo, New York, depends on customers calling to order wings, pizza and potato skins.</seg>
<seg id="4">But much of the time, it's an automated message pushing a scam.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's getting to the point where it's blocking other callers from coming in," the 24-year-old bar owner said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Help is coming, if slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the past year, prodded by the government, cellphones have added new tools to counteract unwanted "robocalls."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Federal Communications Commission has proposed letting phone companies block more spam and is hoping to deter scammers with big fines.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say these steps are not a cure-all, but they're a good start.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal and state "Do Not Call" lists are supposed to protect people from unwanted calls from telemarketers.</seg>
<seg id="11">But scammers don't care about breaking the law.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scammers reach people cheaply and easily using "autodialers," which spew out a large number of calls automatically.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's estimated that Americans receive tens of millions of robocalls every day.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not all of them are fraudsters, of course.</seg>
<seg id="15">Pharmacies send automated messages about prescriptions being filled.</seg>
<seg id="16">But too often, it's this: you owe the IRS money; it's Microsoft calling to fix your computer; free cruises!</seg>
<seg id="17">And spam callers have tricky technology that makes a phone's caller ID display a local or important-looking caller, like the IRS.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cracking down on "spoofed" numbers would make running a scam more difficult and save U.S. consumers millions of dollars, a group of state attorneys general said in an FCC filing.</seg>
<seg id="19">Phone companies and independent apps can screen or block unwanted calls by checking them against databases of known problem numbers and analyzing suspicious behavior, like a number that's calling lots of people on Do Not Call lists.</seg>
<seg id="20">Wireless carriers also have tools that flag incoming calls with warnings like "scam likely," but they aren't available on all phones, or to many prepaid customers.</seg>
<seg id="21">The versions from Verizon and Sprint cost extra.</seg>
<seg id="22">A few Android phones, including Google's Pixel, screen spam calls for free.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jen Vargas, 39, a multimedia producer from Orlando, Florida, said her AT&T app flags and blocks some fraudulent calls to her cellphone, but she's given up with the landline.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Very rarely do I pick up a call from a number I don't know," Vargas said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Apps including YouMail and Nomorobo offer relief on home phones for free, with limitations.</seg>
<seg id="26">With YouMail, your carrier must allow "conditional call forwarding," which forwards calls if a line is unanswered or busy.</seg>
<seg id="27">Nomorobo isn't available through all home phone providers and won't work with older, copper-based landlines.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can also buy gadgets, some pretty clunky, that block calls on home phones.</seg>
<seg id="29">Verizon is also testing warnings about suspicious calls on a home phone's caller ID display.</seg>
<seg id="30">Phone companies can already block some calls that are being faked.</seg>
<seg id="31">The FCC has proposed rules to formalize that practice and permit them to block other calls they suspect are scams.</seg>
<seg id="32">That means Verizon can block a toll-free number that accepts calls for a bank but never initiates a call.</seg>
<seg id="33">Carriers would also be able to block calls they know aren't legitimate, like a number with a 911 area code.</seg>
<seg id="34">The rules still need to be finalized.</seg>
<seg id="35">Maureen Mahoney, a public policy fellow at the nonprofit Consumers Union, said the development is "promising," but won't protect consumers from all unwanted calls.</seg>
<seg id="36">For one thing, "Do Not Call" lists don't apply to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="37">In addition, Mahoney said, the FCC rules would cover only faked numbers.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not all robocalls are spoofed.</seg>
<seg id="39">Consumers Union wants phone companies to make call-blocking tools available to all consumers for free.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the longer term, the FCC supports industry efforts to verify that callers are really who they say they are.</seg>
<seg id="41">Perhaps one day, you'll see a green checkmark on your smartphone when the caller is legitimate.</seg>
<seg id="42">U.S. Telecom, the phone-company lobby, says rolling this out could take a few years, but would prove powerful against robocallers.</seg>
<seg id="43">The FCC is also seeking ways to stop annoying calls from dogging consumers when they change numbers.</seg>
<seg id="44">Today, if you sign up for Do Not Call but then get a new number, a marketer may not know and could pester you on your new line.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Robocallers aren't going away," said Aaron Foss of Nomorobo, a call-blocking service for cellphones and home phones.</seg>
<seg id="46">"These guys are criminals and they're going to find their way around any system.</seg>
<seg id="47">But it's our job to make sure we make it as difficult for them as possible."</seg>
<seg id="48">There are common-sense measures for consumers to follow.</seg>
<seg id="49">Don't answer the phone if you don't recognize the number.</seg>
<seg id="50">Yes, this is impractical on business phone lines, like Sports City's.</seg>
<seg id="51">Hang up on unwanted callers.</seg>
<seg id="52">Don't talk to them or press any buttons.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you engage with them, they might flag you as someone who's responsive and inundate you with more calls.</seg>
<seg id="54">Block the number after the call, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="55">Use call-blocking apps.</seg>
<seg id="56">If you have privacy concerns, check the app's policy to see if it's sharing your call or contacts data with marketers.</seg>
<seg id="57">Don't give callers personal information, like bank account or Social Security numbers.</seg>
