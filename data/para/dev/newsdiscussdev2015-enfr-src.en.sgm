<seg id="1">Sounds like a typical rugby club to me.</seg>
<seg id="2">At an English university, perhaps...</seg>
<seg id="3">Not like any rugby club I know about in NZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">It doesn't make it all right though, does it?</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course it's not right, but the original premise that this is rife in rugby is just pertinent bollix...</seg>
<seg id="6">Well we don't interrupt Muslim prayers or break people's noses in drinking games (well, unless that's part of the game), but we have been known to black up for fancy dress parties.</seg>
<seg id="7">Never played a Nazi themed drinking game though.</seg>
<seg id="8">Yeeha and Ride the Bus are good enough.</seg>
<seg id="9">I made a similar comment on the previous article as the language and sentiment in the fresher's leaflet seemed fairly typical to me.</seg>
<seg id="10">However this new information makes it clear to me that they are going beyond the usual misogynistic banter and drunken pranks often associated with university rugby teams.</seg>
<seg id="11">The incident with the Muslim students especially shows they must just be trying to cause as much offence as they possibly can.</seg>
<seg id="12">You clearly know nothing what so ever about rugby clubs.</seg>
<seg id="13">But hey, why let your prejudice and stereotyping get in the way of facts?</seg>
<seg id="14">I would imagine that LSE rugby team is populated by ex-students of those schools that have a tradition of competive rugby union.</seg>
<seg id="15">In other words ex-public school boys.</seg>
<seg id="16">Very different backgrounds to those found within the rugby club in NZ, very different attitudes.</seg>
<seg id="17">So 'misogynistic banter' ok then?</seg>
<seg id="18">Sounds like the rugby club when I was at uni, never witnessed any racist behaviour, but the naked runs through campus, theft, property damag and misogyny were all par for the course from what I personally witnessed during my years living on campus.</seg>
<seg id="19">Absolutely not.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sorry I didn't make that clear in my last comment.</seg>
