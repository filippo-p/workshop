<seg id="1">Gutach: Increased safety for pedestrians</seg>
<seg id="2">They are not even 100 metres apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorfparkplatz in Gutach became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights.</seg>
<seg id="3">Two sets of lights so close to one another: intentional or just a silly error?</seg>
<seg id="4">Yesterday, Gutacht's Mayor gave a clear answer to this question.</seg>
<seg id="5">"At the time, the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route," explained Eckert yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kluser lights protect cyclists, as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Bergle.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system, which officially became operational yesterday, is of importance to the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junction.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have the museum, two churches, the spa gardens, the bus stop, a doctor's practice and a bank, not to mention the traffic from the 'Grub' residential area.</seg>
<seg id="9">"At times of high road and pedestrian traffic, an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety," said Eckert.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office.</seg>
<seg id="11">"According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gutach on the B33 on a daily basis, of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent," emphasised Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary: "Here safety comes first, it's that simple," said Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="13">A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered, however, this idea was rejected on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junctions.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Arnold, every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts: "Using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree trunks, we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sulzbachweg without knocking over the traffic light posts".</seg>
<seg id="15">The traffic light system itself, which cost around EUR 15,000, is the "most modern system that is currently available on the market," explained Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="16">The system is fitted with coloured LEDs, which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights, even when the sun is low in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="17">And they are also energy-efficient: The older light systems consume around 100 Watts, with the new ones consuming just eight.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are three sets of lights per direction of travel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arnold explained the technology used by the new system: It is fitted with two radar sensors.</seg>
<seg id="20">If the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic lights, the top radar sensor checks the traffic status.</seg>
<seg id="21">If the street is clear, the pedestrian obtains a green light immediately, if not, there is a delay of around 15 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="22">An additional radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended.</seg>
<seg id="23">"If a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street, the green phase is extended, thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street," explained Arnold.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road.</seg>
<seg id="25">Yesterday this was not the case: The light had barely turned green for pedestrians when a luxury vehicle sped through on a red light.</seg>
