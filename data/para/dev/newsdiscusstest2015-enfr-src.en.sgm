<seg id="1">This is perfectly illustrated by the UKIP numbties banning people with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="2">You mean Nigel Farage saying the NHS should not be used to pay for people coming to the UK as health tourists, and saying yes when the interviewer specifically asked if, with the aforementioned in mind, people with HIV were included in not being welcome.</seg>
<seg id="3">You raise a straw man and then knock it down with thinly veiled homophobia.</seg>
<seg id="4">Every time I or my family need to use the NHS we have to queue up behind bigots with a sense of entitlement and chronic hypochondria.</seg>
<seg id="5">I think the straw man is yours.</seg>
<seg id="6">Health tourism as defined by the right wing loonies is virtually none existent.</seg>
<seg id="7">I think it's called democracy.</seg>
<seg id="8">So no one would be affected by UKIP's policies against health tourism so no problem.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only in UKIP La La Land could Carswell be described as revolutionary.</seg>
<seg id="10">Quoting the bollox The Daily Muck spew out is not evidence.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ah, shoot the messenger.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Mail didn't write the report, it merely commented on it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever controls most of the media in this country should undead be shot for spouting populist propaganda as fact.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think you know what a straw man is.</seg>
<seg id="15">You also don't know anything about my personal circumstances or identity so I would be very careful about trying to eradicate a debate with accusations of homophobia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Farage's comment came as quite a shock, but only because it is so rarely addressed.</seg>
<seg id="17">He did not express any homophobic beliefs whatsoever.</seg>
<seg id="18">You will just have to find a way of getting over it.</seg>
<seg id="19">I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say, but my guess is that you dislike the media reporting things you disagree with.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is so rarely addressed because unlike Fararge and his Thatcherite loony disciples who think aids and floods are a signal from the divine and not a reflection on their own ignorance in understanding the complexities of humanity as something to celebrate,then no.</seg>
