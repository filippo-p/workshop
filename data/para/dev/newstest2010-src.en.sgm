<seg id="1"> Barack Obama becomes the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The American president Barack Obama will fly into Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, the fourth American president in history to do so.</seg>
<seg id="3"> He will receive a diploma, medal and cheque for 1.4 million dollars for his exceptional efforts to improve global diplomacy and encourage international cooperation, amongst other things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The head of the White House will be flying into the Norwegian city in the morning with his wife Michelle and will have a busy schedule.</seg>
<seg id="5"> First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will have his first meeting with the five committee members who selected him from 172 people and 33 organisations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The presidential couple then has a meeting scheduled with King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Then, in the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a grand ceremony, at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He will be the fourth American president to be awarded the prize, and only the third to have received it while actually in office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The White House has stated that, when he accepts the prize, Obama will speak about the war in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The president does not want to skirt around this topic, as he realises that he is accepting the prize as a president whose country is currently at war in two countries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> A few days ago he stepped up the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, something that his critics will be stressing.</seg>
<seg id="12"> At the ceremony, Obama will also be given a gold medal, a diploma, and a cheque for ten million Swedish krona (around 24 million Czech crowns).</seg>
<seg id="13"> He intends to donate this money to charity, but hasn't decided which yet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Their busy schedule will then take the president and his wife to a banquet, which will be attended by the Norwegian king and queen as well as the ministerial chairman and another 250 invited guests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Obama has always been reticent in regards to his prize.</seg>
<seg id="16"> He has said, for example, that he feels that he does not wholly deserve it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> He has repeatedly said that the prize isn't for him, but for everyone who upholds the same values.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Right after hearing about it, he described it as a "challenge to take action."</seg>
