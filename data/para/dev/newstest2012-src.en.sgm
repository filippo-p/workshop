</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Today, the Ukraine parliament dismissed, within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment, the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko, was sentenced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The amendment that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former Prime Minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for mitigation of sentences for economic offences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The verdict is not yet final; the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tymoshenko claims the verdict is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The proposal to remove Article 365 from the Code of Criminal Procedure, upon which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was supported by 147 members of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its ratification would require 226 votes.</seg>
