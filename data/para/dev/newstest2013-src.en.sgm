<seg id="1">A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the Brennan Centre considers this a myth, stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Indeed, Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn-out.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Unlike in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="9">This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, these laws also reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Before the 2006 elections, no US State required voters to show a photo ID card.</seg>
<seg id="14">Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States.</seg>
<seg id="17">Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.</seg>
<seg id="19">In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.</seg>
<seg id="21">And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.</seg>
<seg id="23">In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">And that's not all.</seg>
<seg id="25">Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, these same States allow fishing or hunting club members, who vote more Republican, to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.</seg>
<seg id="28">Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.</seg>
<seg id="29">Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.</seg>
<seg id="30">These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">What is more, in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.</seg>
<seg id="34">These restrictions are not without consequence.</seg>
<seg id="35">For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period.</seg>
<seg id="38">For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African-Americans, who accounted however for only 13% of voters in the State.</seg>
<seg id="39">The same applied to Hispanics.</seg>
<seg id="40">These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted early.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the other hand, 76% of voters were white but these represented only 46% of early voters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.</seg>
<seg id="43">Several bills were blocked by vetoes of Democratic governors.</seg>
<seg id="44">The United States Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.</seg>
<seg id="45">They were able to partially limit the damage.</seg>
<seg id="46">For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key States.</seg>
<seg id="49">A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="51">But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turn-out.</seg>
<seg id="52">In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.</seg>
