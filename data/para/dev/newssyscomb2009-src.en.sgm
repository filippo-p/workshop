<seg id="1"> Right-wing populists triumph in Austria, have total of 29 percent </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to the first preliminary results of the early parliament elections in Austria have brought about a perceptible weakening of both parties in the present large coalition and a significant boost for the right-wing populist parties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current head, Wilhelm Molterer, is being severely jolted, suffered particularly great losses. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Conversely, the campaign leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to the preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, however, it has lost 5.5 percent of votes since the last elections in 2006. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> ÖVP, which with its 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of votes, fared even worse. </seg>
<seg id="7"> These are the worst results of both large parties in Austrian post-war history, and particularly for the People's Party, who urged the early elections, it is literally a catastrophic result. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> At the beginning of July, when ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party still had a significant lead on SPÖ in the polls. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Voters, however, apparently punished them for letting the government flounder. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the first reactions to the results, there were already speculations about the possible resignation of the party head and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Observers anticipate that this could take place as early as at the extraordinary meeting of the party leadership on Monday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Such a development would certainly simplify the journey toward the increasingly most likely recourse from the election results, that is, the renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Given the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) gained a preliminary 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - however, at the same time, the Social Democrats expressed fear of a repetition of the year 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (FPÖ was still united at that time, it broke away from BZÖ in 2005) on a common government, which eventually provoked sanctions from the European Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Haider, who has already announced that he is prepared to work together with any party and presumes he will return to Vienna to national politics, is evidently banking on this development. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Green Party also got into the parliament, but suffered a slight loss and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Evidently none of the other parties exceeded the four percent mark and got into the parliament. </seg>
