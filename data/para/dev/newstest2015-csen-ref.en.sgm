<seg id="1">Petr Čech: Transfer at the last minute?</seg>
<seg id="2">Everything is possible</seg>
<seg id="3">Today is the last day when it is still possible to jump through the transfer window and make a major change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The next chance won't come until winter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Petr Čech is currently a substitute goalkeeper for Chelsea, but now he does not await a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or even Paris.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is sitting at the NH Hotel in Prague, talking to Czech reporters, and he is planning to participate with the Czech team in a rehearsal match with the Americans, after which he will also start the process of qualification for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chelsea will give priority in the new season of the Premier League to Thibaut Courtois in the goal, and Čech for the first time in ten years in the London team has ended up in the position of substitute.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in Čech.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the start of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in competition with Athletics and did not even manage to enter the league season, when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.</seg>
<seg id="10">Interest from Paris SG was also speculated about.</seg>
<seg id="11">It started the French League season with two wins and two draws, and on Sunday it defeated St. Etienne 5:0.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is putting the most pressure on AS Monaco.</seg>
<seg id="13">It so far has a balance of 1-1-2 in the league, and over the weekend it parted with Lille with a 1:1 tie.</seg>
<seg id="14">Today news appeared on tabloid English-language websites stating that the Queens Park Rangers may want Čech.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, according to English bookmakers, Čech's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.</seg>
<seg id="16">Skybet assigned him odds of 4:1.</seg>
<seg id="17">Petr, is it possible that during the remaining few hours you will change your uniform?</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't anticipate it, but in soccer nothing is ever 100%.</seg>
<seg id="19">For example, during the day an offer can arrive that can't be refused.</seg>
<seg id="20">How would such an offer have to look?</seg>
<seg id="21">(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet, how the kind of offer that can't be refused basically looks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There would have to be a consensus among all parties, and mainly would depend on Chelsea's position as to whether or not to examine the offer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Is it even technically possible to make such a transfer when you're in Prague now?</seg>
<seg id="24">Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in a new location?</seg>
<seg id="25">Well, I haven't considered that.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in such a situation, there are a lot of players today, and all of them are somewhere in representation matches, and certainly today a lot of transfers will be finalized.</seg>
<seg id="27">So it could be somewhat achievable.</seg>
<seg id="28">How many clubs are there in the world that could afford you?</seg>
<seg id="29">Well, I really don't know.</seg>
<seg id="30">And are you not pushing for departure?</seg>
<seg id="31">The situation when I have not ended up anywhere as a goalkeeper in the first three games of the new season is new for my fifteen-year career.</seg>
<seg id="32">Nonetheless, there is no need to panic, pack up and go somewhere.</seg>
<seg id="33">I want to stay in the competition for the position of Chelsea goalkeeper, and it's up to the coach who gets selected and what decisions he will make in the weeks to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">What role has your family played in your decisions?</seg>
<seg id="35">I take all factors into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sports prospects are understandably important for me, but I also look at everything from a personal point of view, which of course includes consideration for the family's needs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Is it possible that you could play as a goalkeeper for different team in England?</seg>
<seg id="38">That's a question that I though would never apply to me.</seg>
<seg id="39">But in soccer everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="40">I don't want to rule out anything.</seg>
<seg id="41">I don't know the answer.</seg>
