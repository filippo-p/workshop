<seg id="1">The social card of residents of Ivanovo region is to be recognised as an electronic payment instrument.</seg>
<seg id="2">These changes make allowances for the preservation of discounted travel on public transportation.</seg>
<seg id="3">Starting on September 24, the organisation of discounted travel for citizens of Ivanovo region using the social card will change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The press service for the Government of Russia for Ivanovo region reports that the changes make allowances for the preservation of discounted travel on public transportation and introduce a system of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 "On the National Payment System".</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, the social card of residents of Ivanovo region is to be recognised as an electronic payment instrument.</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, the conditions of its use will change.</seg>
<seg id="7">For example, the loading limit is no longer set according to trips as before, but rather according to an amount of money; and the winter and summer periods will be maintained: in the winter, it will be no more than 400 roubles, and, in the summer, no more than 800 roubles for a given month.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now, when they are issued a transit receipt, social card holders will need to keep track of the balance of funds on the card and not the number of remaining trips.</seg>
<seg id="9">The cost of discounted travel for citizens will amount to 1/2 the fare of the applicable carrier.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other half of the fare will be paid for from the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="11">The schedule for topping up the social card with funds will stay the same: during the period between the 24th of the previous month through to the 23rd of the current month.</seg>
<seg id="12">The new procedure for travelling with a social card will have a number of advantages.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, it becomes possible to conduct detailed accounting of the expenditure of funds on the social card down to the last kopeck.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moreover, it becomes possible to refund loaded but unspent funds.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's also worth noting that the system of mutual settlements with carriers will become transparent, since a citizen now pays for half of the fare, and the carrier will be reimbursed in the exact same amount from the budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">No commission fee will be charged for loading funds onto the card.</seg>
<seg id="17">In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Public Roads and Transportation for Ivanovo region, reported that more than 33 million trips had been made using the social card in 2014, and, in 2015, almost 25 million trips.</seg>
<seg id="18">More than 470 million roubles have been set aside in the regional budget for the discounted travel of citizens using the social card.</seg>
<seg id="19">As of September 1, the total spent for this purpose amounted to more than 312 million roubles.</seg>
